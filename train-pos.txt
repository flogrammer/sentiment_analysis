homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if they ll be next to end up on the streets but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what it s like to be homeless that is goddard bolt s lesson mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bet s on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can t step off the sidewalk he s given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it s written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets they re survivors bolt isn t he s not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it s fight or flight kill or be killed while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn t necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what it s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don t know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money or maybe this film will inspire you to help others 
brilliant over acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently i m a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often 
the night listener robin williams toni collette bobby cannavale rory culkin joe morton sandra oh john cullum lisa emery becky ann baker dir patrick stettner hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand out low key performance what is it about celebrities and fans what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm in the latest derange fan scenario based on true events no less williams stars as a talk radio personality named gabriel no one who reads stories he s penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one s editor ashe morton who gives it to no one to read for himself no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess cannavale whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete s backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn t anticipate written by armistead maupin who co wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film s novice director stettner and based on a true story about a fan s hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot boiler does it helps that williams gives a stand out low key performance as the conflicted good hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for 
i enjoyed the night listener very much it s one of the better movies of the summer robin williams gives one of his best performances in fact the entire cast was very good all played just the right notes for their characters not too much and not too little sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch toni collette is great as the mom and never goes over the top everyone is very believable it s a short movie just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads it is not a hitchcockian thriller see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director could have left a little more to the audience s imagination but this is a minor quibble 
the night listener held my attention with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a year old boy rory culkin who is very ill williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone however williams ex boyfriend nice job from bobby cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect i will leave it at that toni collette also stars i enjoyed this film with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin s adoptive mother sandra oh also starred as williams friend the night listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout at times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but i liked it anyway i enjoy williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me recommended 
i absolutely loved this film i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely enthralled through every second i found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spot on i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was soundly on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening i found that there were so many perfect choices made the casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it there were so many points where the film could ve gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately and for the last number of years 
this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life size dolls that terrorize the guests he dies early in the film or does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences i won t go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must see for fans of old dark house mysteries watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room dan basinger 
after seeing several movies of villaronga i had a pretty clear opinion about him he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie that is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention in aro he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie frankly speaking i slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga recommended 
this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story the casts is outstanding including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ever the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one my one complaint i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that i think they did a great job the dialog the characters and the story was perfect the acting was wonderful this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel you heard me the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel i give the fallen ones out of 
why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather titanic is the greatest movie of the st century with great acting directing effects music and generally everything this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn t like it any more so most of the world decided to agree there is nothing wrong with this movie all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i ve ever seen apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron s masterpiece titanic 
just two comments seven years apart hardly evidence of the film s relentless pulling power as has been mentioned the low budget telemovie status of gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal having said that however the thing is not without merit either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se true the plot at its most basic is a re working of the amityville horror only without much horror more a case of intrigue gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments having picked the dvd up for a mere last week at my regular video store i cannot begrudge the expenditure would be an acceptable price for the film just don t expect fireworks 
what s inexplicable firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason it s a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters i ve rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it it s a movie yes capital m there it s an epic it s a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavy handed at times but the reason titanic works is that it s such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isn t exactly dumb but it s not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didn t cry when bambi s mom died i don t react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and i m sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt you ll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad is a single one of them worth a score of out of no not even the phantom menace and this movie made billion dollars worldwide it can t be bad not possible p s how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasn t anything all that special no one will remember it in years but i m pretty sure titanic will be remembered 
previously i wrote that i loved titanic cried at its ending many times over and i m a guy in his s i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a rating by imdb com users well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings while of all votes gave it a rating gave it a rating these of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in ratings with a high rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio believe me i ve tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn t like the movie that much and gave it a or a etc everyone has and is entitled to his her own taste but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only overall for titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these will prove my point heaven s gate was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were ratings and ratings overall rating of big top pee wee got ratings and ratings overall rating of cat people got ratings and ratings overall rating of blind date got ratings and ratings overall rating of jumpin jack flash got ratings and ratings overall rating of what do all of these films have in common with titanic all of the percentages of their ratings are lower than titanic and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award again titanic got ratings compare that to the other movies i just mentioned can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor 
i loved this movie since i was and i saw it on the opening day it was so touching and beautiful i strongly recommend seeing for all it s a movie to watch with your family by far my mpaa rating pg for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nudity sexuality and some language 
the movie titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten why so criticised i have no idea could will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece it will be almost impossible the director no doubt had the major impact on the film a simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance yes i m not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this guaranteed everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling everything looks very real and live the legend herself titanic is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too accommodation the acting was the real effect dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles no one could have done better they are partly the reason why the film is so great i guess it s not too much to talk about the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you haven t seen this film your missing out on something hesterical and a film to idolise for hollywood could it get better no not at all the most moving film of all time don t listen to people see for yourself then you will understand a landmark don t be surprised if you cry too 
titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill fated voyage on the unsinkable ship writer director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they make for a good on screen couple dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it s few flaws titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch 
the ship may have sunk but the movie didn t director james cameron from the terminator did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is the dinner table scene in which rose s family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet the one i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband jack and rose have a connection that is movie stuff but it s good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good risk the movie is long but it s fantastic good story good flow good actors go see it twice if you want its worth it 
titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years of experience to stretch the titanic s legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april at an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic s many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and rose s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanic s officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire s captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer s former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower class passengers from non english speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husband s side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over four thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re creation of the post victorian era of the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the women s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to `new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people s lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesn t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you 
i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasn t that bad or else people wouldn t even bother to talk about it i personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do i guess this film isn t for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many as for those that think that this film is overrated or over hyped well we only have the movie going public to thank for that lol you see it s not critics article writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general movie going public people make the film a huge success with titanic everyone was in awe let s face it a film like this had never been made before at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april even the silverware for goodness sakes matched give this movie a break you guys the critics thought this movie would sink big time when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a good decent movie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie not once not twice but maybe times and more so i really wouldn t say that this movie was overhyped at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped ha critics didn t even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron s gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film however the films money took care of that million budget and much more personally i love this film however this film might not be for everyone don t say that this film sucks just because of romance though that is the most sexist thing i ve ever heard disliking a movie just because it has romance in it the story was sweet the dialogue could have been better but let s face it the real star of the movie wasn t leo or kate it was that gigantic ship i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job it s not thier best work i ve seen much better work from both of them but it wasn t the worst i ve seen on screen before give them a break 
i am not a parent neither am i a male but i was able to identify with every character s heartaches and pains this is a movie teenagers should watch maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again i m sorry for those that don t understand the value of love family and friendship it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing and it is great to see a year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance he showed at an early age that he is capable of heartfelt drama he should be offered more serious roles note hollywoodland his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages maybe shouldn t be watched by children under because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families but i recommend it to the entire family i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times because it portrays the values that are important in life 
family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about one man daddy has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity the kids grow up one all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances yes i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent this true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents a must see for those who care about their families 
this is a film not porn this is a wonderful film full of tender moments and memories a beautiful piece of work excellent for intelligent viewers only if you are a film lover a romantic a person who has loved deeply this is your film it has a beautiful surreal quality fine acting and directing watching this film made me remember my first love thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life love and the meaning of loss highly recommended for all film lovers 
we watched this in my women s health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and i absolutely loved this movie i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating this is a movie i will show to my children the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite

king of masks bian lian in china is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film winner of awards from around the world this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian a street performer in s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face change opera he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance and no one knows how he does it he has a longing desire to have a grandson as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir we then go to the streets and see that people are selling their children because they can t afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free because daughters are not worth much in this society wang bianlian s story goes on from there the film was so astonishingly good the acting was amazing and the issues were so weighty and well addressed there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place no one wants a little girl also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman and while he is famous and well respected he regards himself as something low a half woman as we go further into the film the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it the brutality and corruption of the military and police and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life and xu zhu the actor who plays wang bianlian presents yet another beautiful performance 
this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended 
this movie was excellent a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions this equals on big happy movie in the end this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture the cinema photography is excellent in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film 
an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film shameful since it warrants having a wider audience a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told although admittedly predictable in its resolution solidly acted by the principals beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film my recent foray into chinese film shower the road home not one less has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring china and its people is an amazing canvas for film makers the king of masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film 
quote by nicolas martin nicmart from houston tx fine film but dvd reformatted for tv april this is a charming and emotive film on the other hand the dvd i purchased has been reformatted to fit your tv by the clods at columbia tristar there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic disposable trash that it is so used to producing what a shame what a criminal shame indeed however there is another version out though see here for details http www dvdbeaver com film dvdcompare kingofmasks htm wonderful performances by the two main actors the king and doggie btw 
 masks is a moving film that works on many levels at its simplest it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art masks to the next generation although at times the story makes the old man into a job it is so well crafted written acted directed wonderful production values it is easy to move beyond his plight and if you hang with it the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting kudos all around this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it 
i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the s in this beautiful film the story is simple an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children the faces of the actors are marvelous to see the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine which was more sophisticated and intricate the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism humanity and history portrayed 
in the rapid economic development of s in china there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth and more importantly due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural revolutionary era however the resurgence of chinese traditional culture namely the confucianism was not without disasters because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example moreover not only the part that should be discarded were inherited the good part that was supposed to be inherited such as the traditional opera and its technique such as changing face was ignored in the resurgence and facing extinction the director used this film to criticize the problem of re embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie 
this is a beautiful rich and very well executed film with a rich and meaningful story basically it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a male heir to carry on his craft but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male dominated world the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society s traditional notions the story is fun emotional and complex the exploration of the characters their lives and emotions is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all the film expertly conveys the old man s emotions and his desire to find an heir and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation there is also humour sometimes quite subtle at appropriate points the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture creating further interest and depth to the film the directing acting and scenery are all outstanding added to the other strengths this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling real characters as a result the film evokes strong empathy for and feelings about the characters some have claimed that the ending weakens the film but i do not necessarily agree perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small 
the movie is truly poignant unique and uplifting the story is universal in that it s a battle between good evil and the world between the most important thing is that its rating is wrong misleading and a travesty blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub titles 
i just saw this movie today with my children son and daughter at the rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director tian ming wu he through a translator told several stories about his life and the making of the film all tangents aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie of course i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually self explanatory i won t give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than of the hollywood crap especially children s films out there cheers p s there is a real original king of masks who can could do masks at once the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to masks at a time then they would cut and change to new masks 
this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows it s full of cliches and the liz taylor character is not believable it has a marvelous set some exotic location footage it shows taylor at the height of her beauty she looks stunning 
 or type on a computer keyboard they d probably give this eponymous film a rating of after all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt to the contrary the master of elephant walk john wiley peter finch complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms no matter how menacing without a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability furthermore the elements conspire in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people as the natives dub them to close the story if you happen to see the current release earth you ll detect the elephant people are faring less well today 
i got in to this excellent program in about season and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of and it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after seasons sadly now the sci fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more atlantis is still going strong on its th seasons and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead this tv show is a must see for all sci fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it 
a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon although based upon the book by robert standish this initial set up is highly reminiscent of hitchock s rebecca with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and almost immediately her own husband who is still under the thumb of his deceased but dominant father taylor a last minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh looks creamy smooth in her high fashion wardrobe and her performance is quite strong however once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic this feeling hampers the ending as well still the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs romantic drama a bit of travelogue interpretive dance an elephant stampede and a perfectly timed outbreak of cholera from 
elephant walk may not be the acme of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasi melodramatic mode it is the story of love both genuine and illicit as well as overweening ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal tyranny a previous reviewer john mankin questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called elephant walk should have been built by the former owner the governor the late tom wiley right across the elephants traditional path to the major source of water the river to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man that his son played by peter finch should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father s rowdy boys club as his role models the point of the father was that he was a self made man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water this is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water what will humans do to get power or love ceylon today s sri lanka is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the expenses of miss taylor were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in ceylon and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the english immigrant conquerors that were part and parcel of the british raj it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony teak and marble not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors j mcmillan johnson and hal pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought for those immune to the blandishments of time place and architecture there is always the allure of miss taylor as she marries a man she doesn t really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man against the background described and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased as i said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive in not on the home tv so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera work and scope 
robert standish s novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a ceylonese tea plantation so the events of the ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to william dieterle s film the story is about a rich powerful planter peter finch who brings a charming and tender beauty elizabeth taylor into the jungle as his bride the plantation of course is endangered by some kind of wild life for this reason taylor elegant as never in dazzling costumes finds herself in a strange atmosphere the echo determination of a ghost the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father a highly dangerous disease and the fury of wild animals in her confusion boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face a pretentious foreman dana andrews who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love with echoes of jane eyre the mysterious yorkshire mansion with a brooding master and rebecca the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife elephant walk is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow exotic dances with rage excessively colorful stampeding big bull elephants amazing mansion set on fire all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent the movie gave liz a change of scenery and allowed her more creative energy and self respect than most of her other willful debutante rebels the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for 
the anime that got me hooked on anime set in the year hey that s not too far away now the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence seeing as how crimes are happening ever seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem cops with tanks oh the insanity the heroes of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki a red haired japanese woman yeah i know they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond blue eyed nice guy al leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain also known as brenten a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses a big revolver and a bad temper britain didn t like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special a giant green monster tank doesn t exactly endear her to him nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it there s also specs the bifocal genius bible quoting god fearing chaplain purple mo hawked mohican and the pot bellied chief who s right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them they re not very well liked by the people the villains are a cyborg named buaku who s got a mysterious past that s connected with a project known as green peace his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna uni puma in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven t been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the nd they re hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku the story however was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic manga book that s very hard to find all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it you d better go get quentin tarantino uneven in places but still a lot of fun followed by new dominion tank police 
fact stargate sg is a cheesy sci fi tv series there s no escaping facts how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg remains a cheesy sci fi tv series stargate sg does borrow and steal ideas briskly special fx aren t nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn t going to blow you out of the chair or couch for that matter either but and this is where i really think stargate sg deserves all the credit it can get for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci fi movie that s actually worse than a one hour tv episode in fact some episodes actually could probably have been minutes long and still have been better than most movies and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg special i am very picky with my selections i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg as yet another tacky sci fi show don t stick with it and you ll see what i m talking about 
scott bartlett s offon is nine minutes of pure craziness it is a full frontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsy inducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avante garde cinema there s no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature particularly the human face and form to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highly industrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal in stanley kubrick s a space odyssey and indeed bartlett s opening sequence of images flashing colours before a close up human eye recalls dave bowman s journey through the stargate the visuals are richly coloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasingly grainy video as though we re sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitor there appears to be some confusion about the film s release date imdb lists the film as a release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give as the correct year perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film s completion and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a s music video and some brisk techno music wouldn t have gone amiss either offon captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information i had a thought and please don t laugh at this free thinking interpretation that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth s television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguely familiar imagery that couldn t possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality 
i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it but have seen it or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence kay kyser s mysteries would be a good example having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action doing a fine job of support hugh o brien plays the face buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus abbott and costello replacing the leads don t know if that was true all in all a pleasant movie but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history wish that it was released as i haven t seen or heard of it now in two decades hope it is not lost
 ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india the film tells the real life scenario of mumbai police of the s unlike any police of other cities in india mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment amongst various police officers colleagues the film describes the story of anand velankar a young hot blooded cop coming from a poor family his father is a harsh police constable anand himself suffers from his father s ideologies incidences of his father s atrocities on his mother anand s approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors this leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms bars also turning him to an alcoholic the spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system he is aware of the system of the metro where the police politicians are a inertly associated by far end his compromise towards unethical practice is negative finally he gets suspended the direction is a master piece thoroughly hard core one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty s house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic at many scenes the film has hair raising moments the practical approach of script is a major punch alcoholism corruption political influence courage deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today those aspects are dealt brilliantly finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly 
an absolute classic the direction is flawless the acting is just superb words fall short for this great work the most definitive movie on mumbai police this movie has stood the test of times om puri gives a stellar performance smita patil no less all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society this is the story of a cop om puri who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops kudos to nihalani after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal politician police nexus thus this movie was truly a trend setter this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade this movie was a moderate box office hit a must see for discerning movie fans 
govind nihalani s directorial venture of vijay tendulkar s novel is brilliant om puri plays an inspector velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar this is govind nihlan s most talked about movie this is a very good and a classic film smita patil plays the female lead opposite om puri naseeruddin shah is brilliant in a cameo role although sadashiv amrapurkar has only scenes in the movie he dominates the movie this was sadashiv amrapurkars acting debut om puri won a national award for this film for the best actor filmfare award winner for best film story supporting actor sadashiv amrapurkar 
any story comprises a premise characters and conflict characters plotting their own play promises triumph and a militant character readily lends oneself to this ardh satya s premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by dilip chitre the line goes ek palde mein napunsaktha doosre palde mein paurush aur teek tarazu ke kaante par ardh satya a rough translation the delicate balance of right wrong commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another is the needle on the center a half truth the poem is recited midway in the film by smita patil to om puri at a resturant it makes a deep impact on the protagonist lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow at the end of the film om puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem the film tries mighty hard to do a one up on the poem however chitre s words are too powerful and at best the film matches up to the poem in every aspect 
i originally caught this back in in its one week run at a movie theatre i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven t much changed documentary about the infamous edward d wood jr covering his life and movies there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him they include vampira dolores fuller bela lugosi jr loretta king gregory walcott and paul marco interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations it is interesting somewhat but was this really needed i ve seen all of wood s films and they re just terrible wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out i wouldn t say he was the worst director ever but he s down there do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker i do like the fact that they didn t try to make wood out to be some sort of saint more than a few of those interviewed especially lugosi jr pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the s and s still it s of interest if you re a wood fan the best interviews are with vampira who tears wood apart and dolores fuller a long time girlfriend 
 the haunted world of edward d wood jr is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as glen or glenda bride of the monster and of course plan from outer space this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries such as look back in angora and the plan companion failed it rounds up his surviving entourage many of whom have passed away since filming and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director down to the haunting music this documentary is an absolute must see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed s life and untimely death for the viewer best watched at am while wearing an angora sweater 
i really like miikes movies about yakuza this one i saw about years ago and it really fu ed my head never before seen such a sick and twisted thing the story is good and the actors do their thing very well i haven t seen the uk or japan version but i have to say that i believe that the german dvd is a bit censored if you haven t seen the movie already and live in germany maybe you better look out for a dvd from the nederlands or austria the i on dvd contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes but at the showdown i felt that something was missing about one or two very short scenes all in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence that s what i like miike for 
i love jack s jokes like the clich is or over the top clich guy black oily skin kinda spooky he is just hilarious daniel s starting to catch up on him to good thing jack s not on the team anymore in a way or else it would have been sarcasm mania i just love all the plots season a little less i have to admit the characters are great the actors are great i m starting to pick up facial expressions and more from jack daniel and teal c it just all theoretically possible and exciting oops their i go again sorry i m also starting to pick up traits from carter and all of this is driving my parents nutz well to conclude i think it s good for another three seasons or so especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor drama action and so forth 
while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike s later films this is a very good crime drama the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film it is a very very good one this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don t mind a no frantic pace a word of warning the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty there are also semi graphic depictions of gay sex if thats not your cup of tea proceed with caution or out of 
shinjuku triad society albeit from perfect is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber conventional realm it s a yakuza triad picture involving cops versus japanese or chinese gangsters mostly chinese as the title suggests but already even in his first technical debut takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here on in social issues like black market trading of precious goods in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and one s roots which was especially prevalent in dead or alive thumbing of the nose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rape violence towards women blood curdling violence it s certainly not as surreal as some of miike s most recent films but this is expected as he s trying out things that he s just starting to learn following a track record of straight to video programmers it s got all of those qualities and it s also like the films that would follow from it equally savage and heartfelt crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama and solid for genre fans the story concerns two brothers one a chinese orphan raised in japan tatsuhito kiriya kippei shiina pretty decent as a eastwood esquire anti hero hero who s become a detective and another who s become a gangster or a would be one the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare time played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes and his partner karino takeshi caesar who s threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who s just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie there s some intrigue involving the organ trading scheme with the gangsters which kiriya almost becomes a victim of and the gang s penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want it all leads up to vengeance and redemption qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it won t come off if it doesn t add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have it s par for the course of a film like this miike s goals are met though just met in his low scale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime and what the realm of unrepentant sex with both sexes brings out psychologically in the characters at the same time shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black comedy from the miike oeuvre some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area there s even a laugh out loud line from the young sex slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses thank you mr weeny burger miike and his writer don t have enough here to make the film a full on dark comedy like ichi or of course visitor q but there s enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters as the first entry of the black society trilogy as it s called i was quite impressed and it s a fine quasi calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema 
a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true miike film and i thought this sort of description might have been a clich but like all clich s it is based on the truth all the miike trademarks are here the violence the black humour the homosexuality the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character shinjuku is however one of miike s most perfectly formed films he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different but not necessarily better i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film as you might expect the violence is utterly visceral gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that the film has a fantastic pace unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle dead or alive also deals with similar issues miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past i cannot sing shinjuku s praises enough i do not want to give away too much this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano s sonatine the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you ll be popping it back on again to work it all out 
this was the beginning of it all granted this is not friends at its best but this was the show s pilot let s not forget and not a bad one at that we re introduced to the gang and central perk where our story begins even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years when ross says i just want to be married again and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back something else in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes the so called flashbacks this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions nevertheless the point is this a fine start to a great show this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was keep watching first season is a blast 
here it is the first ever episode of friends where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar courtney cox newly divorced ross gellar david schimmer hippy pheobe buffay lisa kudrow unknown actor and ladies man matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing matthew perry this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green jennifer aniston the episode is better than most people give credit for like any new sitcom the first episode isn t always fantastic the acting in this episode isn t great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters apart from kudrow and perry who shine matt le blanc man his acting was down right dreadful because until later he gets more confident but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails david schimmer why does he over pronounce every word he cannot speak normally but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons but he isn t confident and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston looks hot and does a good job as rachel green but we only see the real rachel later in the st season courtney cox looks quite anorexic in this episode its worrying she looks totally different now more healthily she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this minute pilot lisa kudrow and matthew perry i m doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe pheebs and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically the episode quality does improve later such as the sets they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly the acting is ok the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot i hope we see the friends reunite cause they will always be there for us 
and that s how the greatest comedy of tv started it has been years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season because that s where friends is based on quotes extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts let s say a big thanks to rachel ross monica joey chandler and phoebe in our first meet we see how rachel dumps a guy in the church how understand monica s search for the perfect guy there is no perfect guy why all you women are obsessed with that and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she s a lesbian till we meet joey phoebe and chandler in the next episodes enjoy friends 
in this first episode of friends we are introduced to the main characters of the series monica geller phoebe buffay chandler bing ross geller joey tribbiani and eventually rachel green we discover that rachel a rich girl that is monica s friend from high school times left her fianc barry at the altar since she discovered she didn t love him she also decides to live with monica and become independent from her father getting a new job as a waitress in central perk ross for the other hand discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan her partner we see him moving to a new apartment during the episode monica in this episode makes out and eventually sleeps with paul the wine guy who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife but in reality he was just deceiving her ps i just loooove joey s and chandler s haircuts in this first season 
what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining right to die is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore spoilers here top credits also go to the dead on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen playing the character in a great aloof fashion you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not so good guy who gets his just desserts end of spoiler as a revenge from the dead flick right to die benefits heavily from it s performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour 
this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh i think mick garris has a problem with women he kill em all they are often the victims screwfly solution pro life valerie on the stairs i don t remember the argento s episode in season etc obviously imprint i think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture mutilated and i don t know never least right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful the acting is like the entire series regular i could be worst like pro life or we scream for ice cream also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode the ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like cigarrette burns the best of all homecoming the most funny imprint really shocking 
i m not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called wrong turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the masters of horror franchise there was a similar underdog story in season one when william malone made on of the best episodes with the fair haired child even though his other long feature films fear dot com and house on haunted hill sucked pretty badly the story of right to die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia but thankfully also features multiple old fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous conspiracies pitch black humor and comic book styled violence whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband s continuous adultery the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor abbey s mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff meanwhile abbey s hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff s surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices after a few victims cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well right to die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv series concept like masters of horror it s violent and gory with a sick twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is always a welcome plus and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean spirited and egocentric bastard great moh episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons 
well its about time i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season s entries while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries at least this episode turned out well its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season in right to die we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back while they speak they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire and this is just the setup people once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes there s also a side effect too every time she flatlines abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it right to die should have the right to go on living forever 
but the fun is in the journey i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times yes it s predictable and yes it s a clich romantic comedy but the point is that it s a sweet story the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways the dialog is dead on and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect the bulgari scene is worth it s weight in gold the actress there deserves honorable mention for those that panned it for being predictable if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing then you want a thriller this is a romantic comedy it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth every effort along the way great date movie great movie for a happy cry 
i d have given this film a few stars simply because it was a lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story here new york city most on this channel whether set there in rural iowa oregon virginia l a etc are filmed in vancouver ottawa toronto or some other canadian locale but if there ever were one deserving the top rating on this site it s this movie certainly not for originality for this story has been done many times in many variations with several very similar to this specific one it s also been done pretty often on the big screen with mega stars past and present from cary grant james garner harrison ford tom hanks et al and deborah kerr doris day meg ryan and many more i can think of at least more just as prominent past to present off the top of my head who could be added now and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind not to drone on but my point is that in my opinion this is by far one of the best of this genre i ve seen i caught it by chance on a mid day friday at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week i d never run across this flick in the years since it was made and while the two leads have done enough to be known to most they were completely unknown to me the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman anna s mother whom i d seen in some things from her younger days and michael rispoli henry charlie s best friend who was outstanding as gramma the menacing juice loan tough street guy from rounders the chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends as a sub story romance with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later is an oft done plot contrivance within the genre but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact it enhances it checking some other comments i agree completely with those which are the most positive the primary word describing this film is engaging in caps this adjective describes the performers the characters the chemistry between and among all of the characters in whatever combination presented and all of the supporting and even minor roles i love films with a harder edge rounders the escapist schwarzenegger stallone fare goodfellows even the classics like casablanca gone with the wind citizen kane but for pure uncomplicated enjoyment this one was outstanding with a bare fraction of their budgets it was equal to the results achieved by you ve got mail and sleepless in seattle and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn t have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here the co stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega films as well 
a sweet funny story of people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings the ex cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting even though they are marrying other people maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type a personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed not anything heavy but it made me smile and hey for the guys sell the natasha henstridge angle and the gals sell them the sappy romance everyone wins 
a beautiful postcard of new york the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear it never did my teenagers liked it too my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done the ending came with a twist which we all liked too if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch 
this is the first michael vartan movie i ve seen i haven t seen alias and i was curious to see if the guy can act he sure can and is likable in this movie natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles so i found her very good and lovable in this different sweet role of a schoolteacher some of the negative comments i read are true the movie is full of clich s and the story doesn t ring true at all also even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together i don t think there is screen chemistry there however i enjoyed this movie the locales are nice the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good if you are expecting to see a great romance this is not it but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good 
i just can t understand the negative comments about this film yes it is a typical boy meets girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by henstridge talk about winning the gene pool lottery is as magnetic and alluring as ever who says the golden age of cinema is dead and vartan holds his own there is simmering chemistry between the two leads the film is most alive when they share a scene lots it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together ignore the negative comments if you are feeling a bit blue watch this flick you will feel so much better if you are already happy then you will be euphoric ps i am male from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess 
this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash adorned in black of course who sings a lot and narrates a bit also if you like johnny cash this film is quite enjoyable also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work just for fun try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all 
i wait for each new episode each re run with anticipation the new look of sci fi created by stargate sg is a wonder that i hope will never end to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me season should be a thrill in itself i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o neill the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner season after season you cancel this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake also you need a bigger role for the asgard they are just too cool 
i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say it was very very good on all fronts script cast director photography and high production values etc proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in rom com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston who mug and call it acting who da thunk it parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as over her dead body lake bell is excellent too and this is the first time i have seen her and finally paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie instead of lesser films a movie like this never gets its dues from close minded males it s too bad as other imdb reviewers here have noted there is nothing lame about this gem no hack writing or acting and its depiction of contemporary l a and california in general makes every scene look bright beautiful clean and otherwise outstanding in every way never before has a movie made l a look so good ah what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie i won t divulge the plot but as a long time and hard core atheist i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light hearted piece of entertainment it reminds me very much of the old topper movies which were also so enjoyable this movie exposes popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like ghost for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre some of us save our praise for the truly worthy however if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as into the night with michelle pfeiffer jeff goldblum and clu gulager blind date with bruce willis and kim basinger american dreamer with jobeth williams chances are with robert downey jr christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard making mr right with john malkovich etc you ll enjoy this a first rate job all around even if it s kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years but even that plot device doesn t detract from the movie s overall excellence 
this had a good story it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool i ve watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i ve seen in the two weeks jason bigg s character was the best though even though it was small it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning this may be a romantic comedy and i don t like most but the writing direction performing sound design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool this film scored pretty high out of all the movie s i ve seen lately and the rest were big budget or better publicized good job in writing 
this is a great film i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this i had never heard of it or anyone in it excpet mike from friends but it is great eva lake and paul give amazing performances the humour is consistently dry and witty paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends which works great the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic i mean we are not talking apocalypse now here but the characters are likable the story is engaging the soundtrack production and direction all work well in all a great feel good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets everyone has their own tastes but i really don t understand the one star reviews for this 
i watched this on an hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude i actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mild the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fianc falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they don t get together but eventually she lets them do it sadly the actual film wasn t as good ok there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on i think the whole gay but not gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasn t really very funny in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call 
over her dead body was a nice little movie it was decent and entertaining while still being pretty funny there were a few clich s but i found most stuff fresh at first i didn t think it was going to be good at all when it started out if you can get past the first minutes though the movie starts getting more interesting this film wasn t burst out in laughter hilarious and wasn t oh my gosh wonderful it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was i don t see how this movie was bad it s rating is just a bit too low i could ve dealt with a but a also giving this movie a is disgraceful it was pretty good and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a which is what most people gave it 
i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full vote if claudia black had not continued on in it her inclusion as the silly vela has brought the series down in my estimation to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of jack and really didn t need this great series turned into new episodes of farscape i was a great fan of the film stargate and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation
friz freleng s rumours is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic inducing rumours during wartime produced as were all the snafu shorts to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films rumours is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long rubbery piece of baloney and several strange fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his country s military rumours is inventive fast paced and funny all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured don t badmouth the military message it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts 
tim krabbe is the praised author of het gouden ei a novel that was put on the screen twice spoorloos and the vanishing one of the dutch writer s more recent works is de grot a psychological thriller about two totally different men egon and axel who meet at a youth camp and surprising enough become friends for dear life egon is a quiet somewhat dull person who spends his time studying and writing geography books axel on the other hand is a charismatic party animal a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday s concern is to get a woman into his bedroom from the moment they meet axel has a strong influence on egon while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like egon ultimately egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country after having read the book last year i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it in my opinion the book suffers especially from the complex structure while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode because of this the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a character s background to really care for him or her another complaint was the fact that the main characters egon and axel are a little stereotypical egon is the dull intellectual while axel is his exact opposite in real life such one dimensional people rarely exist in books and films they always seem to be there taking away a lot of credibility despite all this the film was a pleasant surprise being much better than the book the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography humour and acting fedja van huet egon is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting which is in my opinion the highest an actor can achieve the drawbacks of the film however are the same as the book s mainly because the characters are one dimensional they are so predictable that it becomes annoying guess who wrote the script indeed krabbe himself it is obvious that this talented director that s what the movie makes clear anyway is hampered by a deficient screenplay perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book 
de grot is a very good film the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabb who also adapted this story for the screen some really top class acting not only by van hu t but especially by marcel hensema who mostly did tv work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf the film seems to kick of as a thriller and sets an excellent mood then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash back structure which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character driven drama of the movie in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending that will grab audiences by their throats make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie a must see especially if you liked spoorloos the vanishing s original screen adaptation 
indian directors have it tough they have to compete with movies like laggan where henpecked castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots devdas a hapless fedar festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one s feelings or sentiments alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry but to make a good movie you have to tight rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit bollywood leading actor who is marginally handsome so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words defending his village this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar narasimhan nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with song dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won t sell a sad but true state of affairs faster this changes better for bollywood all said and done this is one good movie 
seeing this movie was the most fun i ve had at the cinema in a long time however i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied this picture has everything any movie could ever have it has characteristics of a romantic comedy a political commentary a thriller a drama an action movie a musical and an absurdist self conscious art film it s all in there adding up to a myth the basic premise is about an indian couple nandini karishma kapoor and shekhar sanjay kapoor happily living in canada who rush to india to visit the husband s parents after a disturbing news report the rest of the story takes place in india where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence at one point the story borrows from not without my baby but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions including shah rukh khan s dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie in fact the two stars are on all the posters but they appear really late in the film and only shah rukh ends up being a real character yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film and she does an admirable job having to link up the film s twists and turns with a show of believable emotion another notable presence is nana patekar who plays narsimha the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar nana patekar dominates every scene he s in with a scary but nuanced character the movie is not without its share of realism violence is rampant but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions at times this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic i have seen a share of bollywood releases and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm but shakti raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained it is pure gratuitous cinema and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book perhaps the all important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind but i came out of watching shakti exhilarated making movies can be the most fun in the world 
the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother s love the exceptional performances the steady execution and the quite innovative script the film tells the story of an indian woman nandini who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to india when they get into the village nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture shekhar s family ruled by his cruel highly cynical and merciless father narasimha lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home but he is soon killed by his father s enemies when she wants to leave narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india here starts the intense struggle which can be called nandini vs narasimha india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas so it may be even correct the portrayal is in my view fair and not one sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world the locations are amazing the music is wonderful and krishna vamshi s direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing one thing that must be noted is the very ear pleasing background score by ismail darbar it is beautiful the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film portrayed realistically throughout the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch its dialogues are superb and intelligently written and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension the film s biggest strength is the performances karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible she displays so much intensity impulsiveness anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child after fiza this is her most powerful performance one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him patekar displays cruelty wittiness and even humanity with total conviction he is outstanding another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india s most underrated actress deepti naval who sensitises her character to perfection sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief anyway do watch shakti it could have been better but it is definitely a must watch 
if any movie stands out extremely with the actors acting skills this is probably the one i ve never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way but having a strong feeling the movie was disturbing at moments however the movie was terrible at editing the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs yet they feel out of place like karisma is getting beat up and the same time srk is fighting comically with the police officers the ishq kamina song was very out of place on top of that the movie is overly glossy in the beginning the direction was not bad but certainly nothing one can brag about i have to say that the actors were chosen very wisely without them this movie would not have an impact karisma kapoor has given her best role to date and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza she looks pretty in the first half and i ve never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date nana patekar was excellent as her father in law not much to say about him besides this is a role made for him deepti naval as the mother in law was excellent especially in her final scene though she doesn t have much to say her facial expressions and body language was good the other good performance was the little kid he was adorable and is sure to bring tears to the viewer s eyes the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances sanjay kapoor was all right but he didn t have much to do shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song and boy aish is mad hot however the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever people may have come to the movie for aish but they won t brag too much about it after wards hum tum miley was properly paced but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie despite the poor editing the performances alone make it a must see 
uneven bollywood drama karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend sanjay kapoor has a child and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords drama and tragedy ensue and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller film is compelling its few song dance numbers are uninteresting and needless the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film s drama at least once we ve left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative if ultimately misplaced as well likewise the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy go lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce and it only gets back on his feet when his character and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance are dispensed with his throw away comic book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film s primary gripping drama the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film s best scenes ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay s sisters in india and very pleasing eye candy but sanjay himself overacts terribly especially during obvious ad libs the directorial style of writer director krishna wamsi is sloppy rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts although his camera movement is good the musical underscore is also quite effective moody featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti s soundtrack cd but bollywood hasn t yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums at least not in most cases but shakti is karisma kapoor s film all the way though and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes despite the unevenness of much of the picture karisma s performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures in a strange way also i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i d noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette both of which i d seen just prior although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family here living in the austerity of terrorism controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china s tang dynasty whose self serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext 
this is the who at their most powerful although before the masterwork who s next which would provide anthems like baba o reily and wont get fooled again this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the s daltrey shows what being a front man is all about entwistle steady as ever moon is great check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech and see him playing side saddle whilst having a bass drum head replaced townsend even looks like he s enjoying himself occasionally considering they took to the stage at am no one in the crowd was asleep there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one 
well it s been a long year and i m down to reviewing the final film for panaghoy sa suba call of the river placed second in the recent metro manila film festival as expected it didn t do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director his great vision and creativity really helped this film he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio she did a great job portraying bikay the younger sister of duroy i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her some of the camera shots in the film were done very well the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film i certainly won t be raving about the story of this film 
i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating s some people have given it it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated now if you don t like comic books or animation then of course you won t like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me though if you are a fan of interesting strong characters and heroic sexy women kicking butt and saving the world hell you will love this movie i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie quite anime esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation like titan a e meet s the live action version of punisher in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie 
this film has renewed my interest in french cinema the story is enchanting the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie 
the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific according to this theory somehow related to the chaos theory i m not sure exactly how every action no matter how small or insignificant will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters most of them in paris whose actions will affect each others lives the six degrees of separation theory can be applied as well each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film the acting is finely tuned and nuanced audrey tautou is luminous the stories mesh plausibly the humor is just right and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement 
we have to remember that the s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies noir two reel oaters etc to movies with a message we had blackboard jungle on the waterfront and so on some folks might think that was an improvement i don t who was the mogul who said if you want to send a message call western union he was right these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy this one is a pip it s about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father s estate one of them maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay he s initially in it for the bucks but eventually falls for her meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance the results are predictable you get a little bit of everything in this movie sexual tension between the sisters a little subtle masochism hereditary insanity if there is such a thing we never get to meet the parents but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar the acting is so bad it s hard to believe it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel air productions it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene i can t explain it not even to myself but i gave this pile of trash an i m familiar with the term it s so bad it s good but i don t think i ever ran into the phenomenon before well maybe hot rods to hell but this one certainly fits you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody s basement 
that hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say it s funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally too only two of the sisters are really bad boy are they bad too one is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e er she goes the other is got up to look like marilyn monroe she has those sensual slightly parted lips and not to give anything away she is even more bad than the other all three sisters are played by starlets the man who stumbles into their lives is played by john bromfield he had something of a career this looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft core porn ever marketed well of course not the first but the raciest at that time the girls wear as little as possible and let s not forget about the female audience members bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor whose fetish was this bare chested he also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit there s a real plot here too the girls family see is cursed they are prone to suicide or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide the movie is not bad i truly don t know where it was shown maybe it was made for drive ins somehow and i could be wrong i felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here the women are scantily dressed they often resemble lurid covers of mags like police detective or jackets of dime novels but the guy seems to be the central focus not everyone in the movie likes him but all the girls love him and i think the audience is meant to also it s lots of fun and on its own terms too 
 some spoilers i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms acting dated dialogue unclear storyline unfounded belafonte is great as a brandoesque menacing swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill equipped from his past life to do so he learns too late how empty his hustling materialistic life was without love mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife fanny in spite of his prayers for a miracle his bitterness prevents him from accepting or believing in one the two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other the result being hilarious and touchingly sad the perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film after looking everywhere for belafonte mostel looks up to see a falling feather and he frantically reaches for it as if he s finally willing to believe in angels and miracles but belafonte wasn t allowed to finish his miracle either to restore fanny s health or mostel s faith so he never got his wings the feather floats tauntingly out of mostel s grasp a metaphor for both men s live it s too late and you don t get a second chance like it s a wonderful life this movie is magical wonderful funny but terribly tragic 
 and i do mean it if not literally after all i have not seen every movie ever created at least obviously among the ones the many i know the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly for example the piece of kannes kompetition krowned korean kraap called oldboy can be truly bad but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under this movie very much worth watching is a disgrace true i give it a in protest the movie is not perfect its true rating should be an or a it has some acting flaws belafonte especially the script wanders around sometimes however what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times the czech jan kadar directing two of the greatest actors of all time the beloved larger than life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting poetic moral tour de force a pair made in heaven it s true that this movie little flaws apart does not pander to the average audiences but those interested in watching an excellent while again not beyond criticism movie of the incomparable director who gave us the shop on the main street the best movie ever about holocaust should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that american beauty is better than the angel levine it isn t 
i got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this film as it s obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it or were stupid enough to pay to see it the best reason to watch was on the elvira show a few years back elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can it s an ok monster flick compared to the hundreds of horrendous american flicks made way better 
i was around when i saw this movie first it wasn t so special then but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun a lot i think the best parts of the film are yeti s body language and the special effects also if you wanna watch this movie don t wait for a hollywood made blockbuster even this film was made from approx dollars i ve a copy of it movie and video version as well but i don t think it had been ever shown in cinemas watch it enjoy it yeti for ever 
being a giant monster fan me seeing yeti was an absolute must especially after hearing so much about it thanks to the good ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually dare i say decent decent for what it is actually namely a cheesy giant monster flick it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately and we get introduced to various characters they consist of some sleazy ones some good ones and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci fi film by far yeti looks like a long haired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert and really he s not that bad of a dude especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage like thing godzilla he is not despite his rude awakening he doesn t even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in english and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are however we want to see the giant yeti do his thing and he s pretty much in the whole movie and in typical low budget fashion he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there s even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing there yes the special effects aren t the greatest but there are definitely some good ones here a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well and in another he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside in one sequence that really looks much much better than it should in such a bad movie yeti never stoops as low as say a p e does actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yeti s nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner but even this isn t that bad and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing but surprisingly enough it doesn t get boring the story is actually good and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks but it is definitely better than other king kong rip offs like a p e and queen kong by very far 
yeti deserves the star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made i saw it at a midnight screening in l a and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill fitting suit the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen and yes there is a mute boy who sorta kinda looks like a girl and he s mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents hmmm maybe therapy for the kid then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti once he thaws which takes forever and he is instantly in love with her what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes bedroom eyes at her it s like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie in fact once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest she accidentally touches the yeti s nipple and yes the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard yikes of all yikes plus there s a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie there s also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girl s hair gee thanks yeti now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout you re the best this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up if you are a fan of classic cinema crap seek this baby out 
stargate is the best show ever all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles i love the connection between the characters if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually can t be because it is completely different i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time which is highly depressing however this program is very very good and is a must see but be warned it is highly addictive so in summery i love stargate and amanda tapping 
people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs congo king kong vs godzilla king kong they all ripoff one another but yeti stands on its own it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal s attraction with one female the yeti myth is based on bigfoot not like king kong and archeologists have been fascinated it at one time they did exist but there is no scientific data to prove it this movie is hard to find but its worth watching it the first time i watched it was on elvira s mistress of the dark shows in the early s it sent chills down my spine as a kid especially when the yeti got mad i saw it again around am on abc about to yrs ago seeing it again made me appreciate it more it has some overall good effects for its time and the story involves a mute boy and his dog and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes also the music is pretty cool its very yeti like gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere vote and half out of 
here s another movie that should be loaded into a satellite fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip off of the already bad movie classic king kong from that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness but successfully predicted much of peter jackson s miserable computer cartoon bearing the same name as far as a romance between the giant here a yeti and a gorgeous human female antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi s city of the living dead who is very easy on the eyes the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness but as a trade off you do get a wacky old scientist two inquisitive kids tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti who turns out to be the good guy glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands a monster who s size literally changes scale from shot to shot some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison crowd reaction shots a plenty made up of either spanish italian or canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie it s here that the film won me over it s enthusiasm just for being made frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in and god s gun the year before this was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action adventure genre film scene from the s s and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever or rather the one he took the most chances with and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids families the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless or rather they are part of the fun and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn t have worked which is exactly why peter jackson s movie sucked he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators and with all it s faults clunkiness kramer s yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space i d rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked trampled tossed about and smashed knowing that and armed with a fertile energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid it s about ten minutes too long but who cares you only come around once and i d rather go out with a smile on my face 
an unusual film from ringo lam and one that s strangely under appreciated the mix of fantasy kung fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes a horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse several horses get chopped up it s very unexpected the story is very simple fong and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple the general has a similarity to kurtz in apocalypse now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak blood is everywhere the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it s never bad enough to ruin the film find this one it s one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties just remember it s not child friendly 
people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie and this movie is no exception some movies i love did poorly at the box office but i m glad to say this movie isn t one of them over nine million dollars which i don t think was bad for back then the characters were fun the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern too which is unusual for an animated movie i didn t think professor screw eyes or his scary cirus was too scary for little kids the targeted audience for this movie but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids movie overall this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years 
i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart but i was flabbergasted when i saw the rating to one of my childhood favourites it doesn t wow me as much at but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie kids will definitely love it and won t mind the flaws and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film none of the film was preachy in any way in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness i will admit though that the story is on the thin side and some scenes like screweyes s death which still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation the music by james horner is very beautiful and the song featured is memorable catchy and amusing i really liked the characters louie is probably the most in depth of them all but the dinosaurs were at least engaging martin short s clown was both hilarious and emphatic the part when he tells screweyes i quit had me in stitches my favourite is screweyes though an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent if anything though i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could ve been more developed in terms of depth the script while not oscar worthy has its funny and heart warming parts and should keep kids and adults entertained the voice acting for me was what made the movie john goodman martin short rhea perlman felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable all in all this is a good movie i don t get the rating honestly i don t sure this film isn t perfect and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time but it is good fun bethany cox
this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young it had everything that was great with s kids movies lovable dinosaurs cute kids an eccentric villain and a few great songs and not the typical little mermaid beauty and the beast type songs but ones that are atually entertaining i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations sorry not the most informative i m in kinda a rush just please trust me all who go against this movie are killing their inner child 
i first heard of this movie after purchasing the flick snuff i was told that devil s experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one so my interest was peaked devil s experiment is a short film with no story no character development just men torturing a woman for about minutes they torture her in various ways like beating her spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol forcing her to listen to hi pitched noise for hours smash her hand with a mallet burning and putting maggots on the burns throwing guts at her and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye i must say that a lot of this movie was fake like the beating scenes but then some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for hours is painful to think about the worst is the eye scene i didn t shutter when watching it but simply thought damn that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie i did enjoy the flick but i don t know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer 
the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers her hand smashed with a hammer her eye punctured with a needle and so forth in the most nauseating scene the woman s captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen believing the series to contain actual murder attempted to ban its distribution in the united states an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers sick re creations using nasty but obvious special effects gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comic book artist hideshi hino who also directed the third and fourth episodes this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms but gorehounds probably won t find anything special 
what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me 
the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her she is beaten savagely spun around in the chair endlessly has her finger nails pulled animal guts are thrown at her hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle really sick and nasty scene the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome i have seen also flowers of flesh and blood which is more gory and sadistic but less disturbing anyway this one is a must see for horror fans 
first off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasn t meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in non shock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid pessimistic i didn t trust anyone for about a week because i didn t want to wake up strung up and tortured 
just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion every line every phrase every picture is exactly in place and lindsay crouse and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazy con man so well cast out of 
unique movie about confused woman lindsay crouse who gets involved with sharp con men joe mantegna gives an oscar caliber performance as the slickest of the group absolutely enchanting first hour as mantegna shows crouse the ropes of his con games story line unravels a bit later on but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world definitely worth a shot 
in the spirit of the classic the sting this movie hits where it truly hurts in the heart a prim proper female psychiatrist hungry for adventure meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman and begs to be involved in his operation while the movie moves kind of slow it s climax and ending are stunning you ll especially enjoy how the doctor forgives herself 
i m a big fan of films where people get conned and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the films where people get conned genre in short it s an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels and never truly revealing what s happening while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you ve just seen the film cons the audience on many occasions and despite us knowing this it s still difficult to guess where it s going and every twist comes off as a surprise as mentioned i m a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout and david mamet does well in establishing his film s setting in the underground levels of the city the film is well acted also with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film and although his performance is a little under wrought he s always solid and believable as the villain of the piece lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work and again is believable in her role she may not be the greatest looker but at least she can act the way that the film executes it s plot is the main star of the show however and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer at times it s almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film another thing that s great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons which is useful if you re interested in making twenty bucks say all in all house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride 
spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters but who is conning who here when does the hunter turn into the prey this gritty dark movie is slow moving and seductive it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path only to waylay you just as you think you are safe it has a riveting script with good acting at least from the leads i didn t notice the background music but it was never jarring so it must have been done right i was very surprised that i liked this movie because i don t usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end 
opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film there isn t a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited 
 house of games is definitely not without its flaws plot holes stiff acting final scenes but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head house of games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do of course this is not a huge feat given the fact that we re dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate so it stands to reason that we never really know what s going on even though we think that we do but that s what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities it has a definite hitchcock slant to it the film draws on some similar themes found his effort marnie considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the master s more thought provoking works one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouse s character being the same as tippi hedrin s ten year later perhaps both are strong willed loners both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool as crouse s repressed up tight character says what s life without adventure put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks 
i m not great at writing reviews so i ll just spout my opinions i loved this series at first the adventure the action the comedy the drama i thought it was all brilliant anderson tapping shanks judge davis i loved them all davis it seemed was the fifth most important person in the cast not a big deal but when his character general hammond left at the end of the seventh season and anderson s character colonel o neill moved from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff i don t know whether it s because hammond was more important that i realized or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turned to the first seven seasons though were awesome the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it but it turned out to be even if this wasn t the original intention a brilliant setup to the series i recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the tv series then watch the movie again you ll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me and then watch the rest of the tv series the last three seasons of the series aren t nearly as good as the first seven but that doesn t mean they aren t good it just means they re a letdown if you ve gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons after you have finished this series be sure to watch the spin off series stargate atlantis it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series edit on i just found out that don s davis died a few weeks ago it is a great loss 
house of games is spell binding it s so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens there are few movies i ve seen that can grip you so quickly from the opening scene this movie just gets you i m trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don t read anymore if you don t want to know i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen bar none from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately joe mantegna was also wonderful the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices i also loved the way the movie was filmed in that grainy surreal type of way it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was there were a few movies i ve seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really house of games is completely different in it s way margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i ve seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying you know something s going to happen but you have no idea what and just when you think you ve guessed what the something is you realize you haven t even scratched the surface house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it s conclusion in closing i d rank this of call it although not my absolute favorite film pretty high on the list most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best twists i ve ever seen as well although i love all types and genres of movies when it comes to movies of the human psyche it really doesn t get much better then this see this movie 
house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels it is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller it is blessed with marvelous performances by lindsay crouse and joe montegna and a strong strong cast of supporting players and it introduces ricky jay card sharp extraordinaire prestidigitator and historian of magic its dialogue written by david mamet is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie in which reality is often in question an extra dimension of unrealness on the face of it house of games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men diametrically different from the sting which was played merely for glamour and yuks at this level it does succeed admirably however you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization the only movie i know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of goldie hawn to chase after some easy laughs house of games sticks to its business as poe once said of a good short story it drives relentlessly to its conclusion there is another strain of movies about women epitomized by thelma and louise a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed whether or not they realize their inner strengths what tripe as usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater it should be a natural for film festivals nominate it for one near you if you get the chance i bought the original version of house of games and gave it to my year old daughter better she should see it on a tv than not at all 
david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `house of games a character study fraught with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game margaret ford lindsay crouse has a successful practice and has written a best selling novel driven still she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life there s an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve and it primes her vulnerability when a patient billy hahn steven goldstein confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers and that they re going to kill him if he doesn t pay she decides to intervene on his behalf this takes her to the `house of games a seedy little dive where she meets mike joe mantegna a charismatic con man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world instead of the `twenty five large that billy claimed he owed mike shows her his book and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean if she ll agree to do him one simple favor which involves a card game he has going on in the back room in the middle of a big hand mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes while he is gone her job is to watch for the `tell of one of the other players by this time not only margaret but the audience as well is hooked the dialogue and mamet s unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines is mesmerizing as mike leads margaret through his compelling surreal realm of existence and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game we are swept right along with her from that first memorable encounter when he demonstrates what a `tell is and how it works to the lessons of the `short con to the stunning climax of this film mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless and nothing is what it seems in the end margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature and about herself she changes and whether or not it s for the better is open to speculation mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows and does crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here you feel the rigid up tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm self assured exterior and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does and makes you understand it as well the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum joey lilia skala dr littauer j t walsh the businessman ricky jay george and william h macy sergeant moran `house of games is the quintessential mamet he s written and directed a number of high caliber plays and films since and will no doubt grace us with more in the future but this film will be the one that defines him and you can go to the dictionary and look it up you ll find it under `perfection this is one great movie you do not want to miss i rate this one 
this movie is amazing while being funny and entertaining it is also profoundly deep and eye opening i will watch it again and again bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life he has a job and a life but it isn t what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness bruce is bitter unsatisfied and resentful that his life isn t the way he envisions it should be as a result of this state of mind bruce ends up losing his job and blaming god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life god comes to bruce and grants him godly powers bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted his life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy with one exception in the process of gaining everything he loses the one person who truly loved him as the movie unfolds bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances but his perception of what was truly there this movie was inspirational and deep if you really pay attention it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize as my wife says since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy and my humble addition may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out 
this is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for if you watch t v then you might as well not watch the movie almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews except one which just happens to be jennifer annisten being the funny one it is typical jim carrey humor and it is really funny just don t go see this movie expecting to be surprised all in all if you like jim carrey or comedies this is a must see otherwise just watch the previews and you ll be just as satisfied 
wow finally jim carrey has returned from the died this movie had me laughing and crying it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from jeniffer aniston was great she will finally have a hit movie under her belt if you liked liar liar you will love this movie i give it 
i have to say from the beginning when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn t blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie with a lot of potential though the movie wasn t as erm amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing even though i m not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people i don t remember one line from either of those movies i m not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you ah getting slightly off the point here well my point is that the that you don t have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series which unfortunately ended after amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end in though i didn t like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in and let me tell you the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn t for stargate and my dad who actually got me into sci fi when i was like and i m glad he did other wise i wouldn t have seen the brilliant shows like sg which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies basically if a new sci fi series isn t better or as good as sg its not worth watching basically this is the best sci fi show to date and if you don t watch this then you have no idea what you are missing 
bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent hey hollywood look how good i can act box office disappointments it s great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths he won t get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the awarded films of the academy he is at the top of his form in this most recent film it s like the return of an old friend carrey freeman and aniston all do a great job together comfortable in their comedy roles superb comic timing and obviously having fun together but without the hey mom look how funny i am type of comedy a real surprise was steven carrell as carrey s nemesis carrell of the daily show fame who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three years i can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be up in arms over the treatment of god but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will without married with children t o complain about this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities who know the types men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television selling prayers to god and again about of the country will care and of the media will report it the bottom line this a purely entertaining film each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do and a feel good feeling at the movie conclusion a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carry thanks again jim it s great to have you back 
after a slow beginning bruce almighty is a very funny film that had something positive to say it wasn t one of jim carrey s best performances but he was still ok morgan freeman was just right as god jennifer aniston had some good moments i miss steve correll on the daily show i like director tom shadyac s choices of movies he also did liar liar patch adams and the nutty professor in all three of those and in bruce almighty he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him a director who knows comedy can get the talent he gets and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find my biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references i only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie my guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people that s too bad because i thought it was a missed opportunity my grade out of 
`bruce almighty will sweep the academy awards with a record oscar wins it will surpass `titanic as the highest grossing film of all time jim carrey s illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the white house playoffs almighty then these grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers carrey included would possess the powers of god that very same premise is the paramount ingredient in carrey s new laugh riot `bruce almighty carrey plays bruce nolan a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total culpability for his own contretemps god heavenly played by morgan freeman grants bruce the `gift of god his powers in order to challenge him if he can do god s job any better obviously bruce gets `carreyed away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in `bruce almighty jennifer aniston was not `mis pittiful as bruce s girlfriend however my premier kudos goes to director tom shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time `bruce almighty is not the most in depth carrey film but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of `carreyism good
jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this season late may and a good improvement on carrey s past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic tearfully somber moments elements of jim s real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy drama bruce almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good natured taste eight out of ten stars 
ok so it s not a masterpiece like the godfather but it doesn t have to be the only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times if it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times it has accomplished its purpose i laughed out loud and left with a smile i feel like i got my money s worth 
well not actually this movie is very entertaining though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be something in my eye routine the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides in fact all the characters are great the movie is not overly funny or sappy good flick to go see with the wife all in all note i am not an easy grader thats all from bigv over and out 
i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn t the goal his character is like all of us wanting more better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver morgan freeman made a great god with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself i thought jennifer aniston s character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry s basically self centered tv anchorman wanna be but that s the way it was written i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart a funny film 
i am a very big jim carrey fan i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura i also like him in his serious movies especially truman show this one is a cross between his very funny side and his serious side he is of course very funny in this movie but there are parts that are very serious and he pulls it off with a lot of ease he is truely a multi function actor as for the rest of the cast i was happy with jennifer aniston s acting i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass morgan freeman makes a very cool god as for steven carell his limited scenes are very funny especially in the anchor scene overall i would have to rate this a good acting funny script and some very serious situations make this a very good film 
i really do not know what people have against this film but it s definitely one of my favourites it s not preachy it s not anchored by it s moral it shouldn t be controversial it s just god any possible god no matter the religion and it s really funny jim carry plays bruce nolan a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news desperate to prove himself more or less to himself that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace jennifer aniston away when the final straws are executed he s quick to not laugh but yell in the face of god who in turn gives bruce his powers bruce then makes his life better for himself until he s guilted into helping others where he then continues to miss the point of his powers meanwhile his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish leaving his relationship on dangerous ground ok that was kinda long but as a plot it works well the step by step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together and is able to hide itself fairly well as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place carrey s pitch perfect acting stays in character which luckily enough is him and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene whether they would admit it or not the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey without him the humour would turn flat as humour is half execution and the humour is very good in the first place but without carrey it would kinda feel like a it s a wonderful life wannabe jennifer aniston is great and no matter what some may say does not act like the only excuse for the third act at least you don t think that when you see her she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you re watching a movie she and carrey feel very much like a real couple the movie feels ggooooodd see the movie to understand has a very nice feeling tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey s career which wasn t goin anywhere 
well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that bore oh god i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one don t consider her to be either ugly or untalented i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman s best 
starring jim carrey morgan freeman jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie i mean what a conceptual nightmare jim carrey playing god nothing is sacred anymore well this movie is hardly sacred but it also is not sacrilegious at least not to any great extent yes jim carrey has the powers of god for a while but he is not god confused i ll give you the low down jim carrey plays bruce nolan a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life he lives with his beautiful girlfriend grace anniston and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground then bruce gets a shot at anchorman only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter obviously not please bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired much complaining and griping about god later bruce gets a page after a while he gets tired of it calling so he responds and goes to the omni presents building heh there he meets god freeman who is the boss electrician and janitor of the building i found this highly amusing god is the boss the holy spirit is the electrician and jesus christ is the janitor think about it boss obvious electrician the guy who keeps everything running janitor the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left brilliant anyway bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god he starts to believe a bit wonder why enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies since this is hollywood bruce obviously eventually smartens up learns his lesson and starts using his powers for the good of the world in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done not bruce s since it is jim carrey the movie is quite amusing and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it the movie is not perfect theology but for hollywood it is definitely a good attempt many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie so while far from perfect definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it bottom line out of worth a view or two 
jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires in that case it wasn t too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn t be ignored i m reminded of the episode of michael moore s brilliant the awful truth when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay the results were not very promising so it s nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart or even better it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film bruce is nearly years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that s seeking to bake the world s biggest cookie he s desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report needless to say he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman s massive talent as an actor he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day there are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in america who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer s religion i for example tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live but despite the fact that i don t believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie jim carrey s movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he s come if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura both of which i loved by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film it s amazing how far he s come he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show man on the moon and the majestic easily one of his greatest films ever jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the side splitting office space as bruce s girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce s growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him there is definitely some low brow comedy in the film that doesn t really fit with the importance of the film s meaning or the quality of the delivery such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura s friend spike make a cameo appearance as stephen king very well knows it s always nice to see familiar characters it s almost like seeing family again bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him the thing i love about this is that like i said before religion is absent from my life but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even more the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records the scene where bruce s rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera and my favorites the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery s cooking the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes such as when he says to god who reveals that he s the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be real bashes and to be careful about drinking because on of him might need a ride home i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes a little too true and as gallagher would add behind every great man is also an amazed mother in law bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection it is a comedy written and performed in good taste but with enough relatively low brow humor to keep the kids entertained this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family which is becoming rarer and rarer these days in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy it s nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching don t miss this one 
as long as you go into this movie knowing that it s terrible bad acting bad effects bad story bad everything then you ll love it this is one of my favorite goof on movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs 
this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories i note both of them are based on short stories examination day is set in the future year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves huge tv looking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age and the examination day a point where year olds must undergo a government required iq test the kid is this story dickie jordan david mendenhall is just celebrating his own th birthday and is a smart kid so is calm even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades his parents christopher allport and elizabeth norment on the other hand say he shouldn t have used his birthday wish on getting a good score and while their reason includes that they believe he s capable and he should have no need to worry it s pretty obvious they are worried i won t give anything away in the ending but i will say this there s a point where we get a glimpse of what s to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another his parents ask dickie whether he d prefer to watch tv all night by today s standards we d be pleased he d say he d rather read and not just because there s nothing worth watching but why would his family ask this the flavor of what s encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon which i hear hasn t received a great adaptation to the screen i only wish they could ve provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was i found it to be better than the short story it was based on i haven t read the one that a message from charity was based on but would like to since it was interesting a year ld boy peter robert duncan mcneill is suffering a fever from unclean water that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever charity payne kerry noonann who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him they both recover especially since it s common for that to happen in but the connection doesn t go away charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of and they each enjoy each other s company especially peter who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students even at the college he s been staying in one place at things take an unexpected turn though when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever not so common in the two try to learn a way to save her the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times through a lesson warning that sounds like something rod sterling would ve cooked up and entertainment make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship love and wisdom do a great deal probably of this has no theme but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling s crew 
it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball likewise an occasional excursion of or hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema the presence of a radio in just about everyone s house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world s events and provided many a drama and especially comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality the literature of the time also flourished at all levels the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures but the comic book just did not magically appear all fully developed with all the colorful color pages all by itself there were mediums that were ancestral to them obviously the newspaper comic strip was one parent providing the visual narrative method of story telling the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine the inexpensive prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going though not necessarily serialized tales the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough s tarzan and johnston mcculley s zorro the s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow the avenger g s battle aces and the spider master of men all found their way to the news stands among many others one other was doc savage a full blooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps the only picture of the hero possessing extraordinary strength super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect doc was the prototype super hero he also assembled of his former army buddies into a small free lancing team of adventurers each of them was an expert in a given field so we had a top rated chemist lawyer construction engineer electrical engineer geologist archaeologist paleontologist etc the doc savage stories were very popular in the s and s and were published into the middle s then they went into a hiatus for a good years then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container the paperback book a fresh look to the cover art was introduced featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc with a perpetually ripped shirt the re introduction proved to be highly successful with the publication of a title a month and for a while more soon there was a rumor of a doc savage movie but when by what producer well the venerable man of bronze was back on the news stands for over years before any real project got put together it was veteran stop action animator and producer of top special effects films geoprge pal who did the film along with warner brothers when doc savage man of bronze arrived in the movie houses it boasted of a well casted team of actors albeit a largely no name as far familiarity with the viewers with former tarzan of tv ron ely s nearly perfect casting in the lead up and coming beauty of a starlette pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler as the villainous captain seas no other name would have been recognized and just maybe that was a plus in this case the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going use of narration by paul frees and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story from the very start there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured camp humor as the batman tv series some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected unlikely outcomes for example an experiment of doc s with a miniature rocket missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish a small one at that the whole story unfolds like that hitting the viewer with a little camp every so often as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously we are also puzzled about mr george pal s being the producer his last he who had been so well known for special effects surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci fi action setting of the pulp character s world i can remember seeing it quite vividly mrs ryan deanna was in the hospital just having given birth to our nd child michelle our older girl jennifer was visiting her grandmother so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward it was straight over to the old marquette theatre rd kedzie here in chicago having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc i was sort of let down by the final product i could accept a little of this camp business but would not have objected if mr pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp comic serial type excitement and yet the cast headed up by mr ely and the others made the whole film likable if not lovable the sets and locations were as far as we can see very much like those of a s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone and maybe that s just what they were trying for with this doc savage man of bronze 
having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based upon this point i cannot comment having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously however what i can say with certainty is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass let s be honest here this film is just so much fun ok so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character s but let s put this into a clear perspective do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic s batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series the point is yes this film is incredibly camp but that s precisely its charm former tarzan ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman best scene far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke lemonade and milk at a formal occasion also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen priceless simply put the film doesn t take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it great fun from start to finish and you ll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed 
 possible spoilers i recently watched this movie with my year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences ron ely is just right as doc cool calm almost always in control and with an occasional twinkle in his eye what more can one ask for i have never read a doc savage book so i don t know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring do many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark which i don t think is fair the difference in budget is astounding raiders must have at least times the budget doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has special effects are also at a minimum but come on people the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right the sousa music is catchy love that theme song every time i watch the film i end up humming the theme for days the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day i give it out of doc savage doc savage thank the lord he s here 
this is a very entertaining movie a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who apparently think that the film was an effort at serious drama it was not made that way it is an extremely enjoyable film performed in a tongue in cheek manner all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us the fight sequences are lively brisk and above all not gratuitous the so called green death utilized on a couple of occasions is not as i read in one review gruesome a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film hey lighten up again i remind one and all that this is a fun film each phase of this fight was captioned which added to the fun aspect the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan this is not one of those martial arts films ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the bad guy seas is dealt with i promise you that if you don t try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value you will spend minutes in a most enjoyable manner 
i was brought up on doc savage and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now i found it thoroughly entertaining i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions granted they mostly think i m odd but there you are i don t know what it is about the doc but he always gets the girls has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre and was way before it s time it is not to be taken seriously move over austin powers ron ely is a god it is unfortunate that this film hasn t been released on dvd in the uk i don t think it should be remade and bastardised like i said it s a classic it cannot be done without ron like the italian job without mini s and michael caine i give it 
we so often talk of cinema landmarks kane the godfather a bout de souffle one film however is too often overlooked by serious film critics i am talking of course about the classic doc savage m o b this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism not to mention kung fu it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history until of course queen s breathtaking work on flash gordon although a bit of a rarity this film is well worth seeking out it will repay the effort of your search ten fold 
trio s vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch observation in film it isn t necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile small morality storytelling is quaint or coy only in the eye of the beholder thankfully story content well told can overcome it s time subject or place ironically there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era inserting small morality content occasionally might provide a dimension lacking 
a message movie but a rather good one outstanding cast top to bottom interesting in that bette davis s plot line is essentially back story the extremely negative reviews name throwing at the screenplay playwright associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about angles in america etc etc object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii gosh that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me theatrical and movie making and acting styles vary over time and of course years later this particular movie would not be made in this way yes casablanca is a better movie i guess but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them casablanca is primarily a love story the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot more of a thriller both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited
this is actually a trilogy of of somerset maugham s short tales the first one is the verger which is about minutes long and very enjoyable after years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can t read nor write so what does he do opens a tobacco shop of course the second is mr know all which was actually a story i had read for school years ago and instantly forgotten until i heard the familiar introduction another minute one and also very good it worked better on film than in a book for me but then perhaps that s because i was only the last time afterall the rd one is nearly a let down almost an hour in length it simply drags it s not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really i hadn t missed a thing overall i give them and out of respectively 
wilhelm grimm alexander knox stands trial for nazi crimes three witnesses give evidence father warecki henry travers wilhelm s brother karl erik rolf and wilhelm s former lover marja marsha hunt before wilhelm speaks in his own defense the film ends after the court sums up the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna shirley mills who wilhelm is accused of raping the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps and the church service where willie grimm richard crane denounces his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend janina dorothy morris marja s daughter after she has been shot at a brothel throughout the film knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter resentful and evil man martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry travers is also very good in his role as a priest this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished 
never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example norway the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates alexander knox wilhelm gimm gorky park returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind marsha hunt marja pacierkowski chloe s prayer played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people s families and their entire lives the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers if you have not seen this film and like this subject matter give it some of your time this film is very down to earth for a film and a story you will not forget too quickly 
this one is tough to watch as an earlier reviewer says that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii particularly the liberation of dachau it is clear that as of the middle of the war we knew exactly what was happening to the jews the sequence that shows a transport is vivid almost as if based upon an actual newsreel the nazis liked to record their atrocities knox as the nazi is brilliant he charts the course of a nazi career that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans at first laughing at hitler then incredulous and finally helpless that contrast however permits us to believe in the conversion of one young nazi officer to an anti nazi stance that did happen as witness the several attempts against hitler most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out a strong film effectively using flashbacks accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended 
norman is that you was this is all third hand so take it with a grain of salt adapted to an african american family from a jewish one when it made the transition off stage and onto screen also it was one of those movies originally filmed in video so the prints from the theater can t have been that great still performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family for that reason alone it s pretty interesting if not a little hollywood don t believe me check out lines about curtains etc very stereotypical not too deep but the movie really shines in a couple of areas there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife who s run away with his brother to ensenada in a souped up pinto the phone conversation across the border is really memorable but the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs to the best of my knowledge this is the only time that routine was filmed and it s a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version i m told still it s vintage madame and shouldn t be missed people are still stealing lines from wayland the man was truly gifted enjoy the movie 
i saw a trailer for this on afro promo the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring african americans it looked like what it is a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay it would seem that redd foxx s rf wife has left him for his brother who works with him at the store back in phoenix he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles so as rf arrives norman wearing nothing but powder blue bikini shorts gets out of his waterbed to answer the door trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the th floor norman tries to wake his lover who steadfastly refuses to budge it was just to the point where i wrote why won t he wake up when suddenly he does and me and my friend s jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue eyed swirl hairdoed garson norman s white live in lover who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from l a he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father s visit garson goes to stay with waylon flowers and madam answers the phone when norman calls so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico while he is on the phone garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him with a burst of s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we re about to hear a very special track by the emotions he realizes that his son is gay his first impulse is i ll kill him i ll kill him then rf goes on a long walk wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man surprisingly he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality this it must be said is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all rf then hires audrey a six foot amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melody then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night he commiserates over the loss of rf s wife and tells the tale of his own mother who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because she was molested at a luau they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose once more mouths were agape so it seems that wouldn t ya just know it rf and garson have a wonderful evening together you see staid traditional older black men just have to see the crappy highly effeminate entertainment of mega queens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer it s really just that simple this still does not prevent rf from yelling rape when garson wakes him from a bad dream it ends less predictably than you d think there was so much that was just off what is the basis of norman and garson s relationship they don t seem to have any rapport and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out and even when he comes around to stand up for himself he never defends garson or talks about their relationship there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality and sitting right down on the park bench to read them i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends other than that it s kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance we could all learn to love and understand one another and because of the whole naivet of this thing the extreme stereotypes and message laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past years i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays female friends are desperately in love with them and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with and by extension convert them hey check out cinema de merde my website on bad and cheesy movies with a few good movies thrown in you can find the url in my email address above 
say what you will about schmaltz one beauty of this film is that it is not pro american it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose to me the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly bette davis mother and brother as fanny says we ve been shaken out of the magnolias in today s political climate where led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings we sunk to the level of the murderers to seek blood thirsty vengeance it can t all be blamed on mr bush after all we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re elected him after his lies had been exposed now with complete justification we americans are reviled throughout the world today we watch this film with a new awareness that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character but a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts i m not comparing george bush to adolph hitler but i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror hatred and hyper nationalism to do despicable things sadly the blackmailer who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement no matter how immoral is most like the leaders of our country those who support them and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand that they can t even be bothered to vote a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be a force for the betterment of humanity and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals geoff
even though this movie came out a year before i was born it is definetely one of my favorite comedies it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son s homosexuality like most parents he doesn t know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like his son norman is now grown up and living on his own when his father ben finds out that his son is gay he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie when ben gets to norman s apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it s his son in drag norman is that you the movie had me laughing from start to finish redd foxx is great although a lot of the content is stereotypical i didn t find anything offensive about the way the material was handled and it even has a good ending highly recommended 
melvyn douglas once more gives a polished performance in which this time he inhabits the role of a detective who can t place love before duty and adventure and the warmly beautiful joan blondell who far from being illiterate as one reviewer suggested wrote a novel about her early life is as enjoyable as ever as his ever suffering sweetheart it s almost a screwball comedy almost a thin man type movie almost a series i guess that didn t quite make it to a sequel it doesn t quite reach classic status but it has all the ingredients for a fun minutes with an episodic but pacey script fine character actors and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don t notice that williams douglas isn t exactly columbo when it comes to detecting i wish there were more films like this 
melvyn douglas and joan blondell co star in the amazing mr williams a mystery comedy that s quite good although forgotten probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed what happens in this film is no exception he s called to a murder scene just as he s about to walk down the aisle yet again both stars were excellent at comedy worked together well and often and help make this battle of the sexes fun edward brophy and donald mcbride are on hand for excellent support as you can read in other reviews melvyn douglas doesn t make much of a woman entertaining if a little on the long side one of the comments here trashed melvyn douglas one of our greatest actors he literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man he wasn t lazy but rather a very hard working actor who made it look easy who had a broadway career simultaneously with his film career he just wasn t cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system i challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in hud and i never sang for my father and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk 
this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society but according to fred schepisi s partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial it was not granted to lindy chamberlain accused of killing her baby the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely a dingo was alleged to have taken it but those implying her guilt even more so and there was no solid evidence against her but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media and the media themselves of course were anything but innocent in this process so although cleared by an initial inquest they were later prosecuted and convicted although chamberlain was eventually released this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence proving their innocence something no defendants should have to produce a cry in the dark is well acted throughout especially by meryl streep who puts on a convincing australian accent at least to this pom s ears and manages keep lindy sympathetic to us while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking because we believe in the characters as real regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story something i can t comment on the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership s least charitable instincts no legal system will ever be perfect but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away i m not a religious man but the bible still contains some killer lines if you ll excuse the pun judge not lest ye be judged is one of them 
a cry in the dark a cry in the dark was a film that i anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from meryl streep and a solid if unremarkable film this assumption came from the fact that aside from streep s best actress nomination the movie received little attention from major awards groups little did i anticipate that a cry in the dark would be such a riveting drama well constructed on every level if you ask me this is an under appreciatted classic the film opens rather slowly letting the audience settle into the chamberlain s at a relaxed pace and really notice that at the core they are an incredibly loving simple family fred schepisi the director selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy while also showing the attentive bliss with which lindy streep and michael sam neill chamberlain care for their children while the famous line a dingo took my baby has become somewhat of a punchline these days the movie never even comes close to laughable the actual death of azaria is horrifyingly captured it is subtle and realistic leaving the audience horrified and asking questions the majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the chamberlain s continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court which suspects lindy of murder the fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping as an audience member i was fully invested in the chamberlain s plight and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media but at the same the media public opinion is understandable i loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic but they always had valid reasons to hold their views the final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas in terms of performances the only ones that really matter in this film are those of streep and neill and they deliver in every way for me this ranks as one of if not meryl streep s best performances for all her mastery of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters i find this to be one of streep s more subtle performances and she hits it out of the park and neill an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in jurassic park is a perfect counterpoint to streep s performance from what i ve seen this is undoubtedly neill s finest work to date it s a shame he wasn t recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match streep s b c the two of them play of each other brilliantly more emotionally gripping than most films and also incredibly suspenseful a cry in the dark far exceeded my expectations i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams the dingo took my baby watch the film and see just how much more there is to a cry in the dark then that one line a 
in august the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock central australia that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area no one believed them lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael as an accessory after the fact the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing the chamberlain s trial was over before it began lindy never proved her innocence so she was found guilty there was never enough evidence to convict her yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure how could we as a nation even sit in judgement from where we are how could we possibly presume to know unless there was absolute proof and no reasonable doubt whatsoever the chamberlains should have been acquitted fred schepisi s film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson s novel that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation hell bent on the truth being brought to light he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay his screenplay co written with robert caswell vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight even her accent is almost but not quite spot on a very good effort by the master of that trade sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart and he starts to question his christianity his as was streep s is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly the entire support cast are also excellent with some of australia s finest actors and actresses playing a part technically the film is brilliant too with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour especially the rock editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged while bruce smeaton provides a telling score for all aussies this is a must see a shocking look in the mirror if you will at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served and the truth to be known as michael chamberlain said i don t think anybody really understands what innocence means to innocent people saturday may video even on return viewings fred schepisi s account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson s novel to the screen telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact what followed was little more than trial by media and with the australian people determined she be put away lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence she is truly awesome and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent though she does her level best to sound ocker you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn t cast in the role but star power is probably the answer alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes while he feels powerless to do anything about it a strong aussie cast lend compelling support editing from jill bilcock is very timely ian baker s cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton s music is perfect for the part truly a must for all conscientious australians sunday june video
i found it hard to like anyone in this film the central characters lindy and michael chamberlain whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback are not bad people but then surely not all or even most of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life s tragic disarray the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip news media crowds mobs and assumptions it s not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular it s merely an account of a true story that happened there society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine s dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one s own unaware perceptions influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one s life the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out from the victims to the masses the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside suspicion was jet fueled mostly by a virtue of hers to the public eye she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter why was she able to keep her cool even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up for tv and the press how much of the downward spiral could ve been prevented had she behaved more to the public s liking in the media meryl streep one of if not the greatest actress working today may not give a performance that particularly stands out and frankly neither does any other actor or department of film making but she and the screenwriters do understand lindy what is infuriating is that it s not that difficult apparently she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie s choice the devil wears prada angels in america or other such work it is a triumph it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself she frustrates us because we don t know what she s thinking or feeling it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her but this is the movie s way of suggesting the reaction of the public s attention she is married to a pastor and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most initially they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god s will kick starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter s death was some sort of ritual killing on their part whatever happened to the little girl her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media s intake didn t immediately identify so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry well meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen but the australian public plays the real leads here like punctuation for each plot advance director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections this golan globus docudrama is not particularly memorable the setting s atmosphere doesn t give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public 
i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself the cast just makes it that much more appealing meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture she nails mrs chamberlain s mannerisms the accent and even look she shows the pain hurt surprise and anger that lindy had to endure and in the process it s hard to remember that it isn t lindy in my opinion this performance of meryl s was better than her oscar winning turn in sophie s choice and should have garnered her her third oscar sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain and for some surprising reason wasn t recognized by the academy with at least a nomination in all this movie only receive one oscar nod streep s for best actress however it did receive several australian oscars and nominations definitely a top rate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast 
meryl streep is such a genius well at least as an actress i know she s been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents but she nails the accent every time her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring mrs chamberlain as portrayed here was not particularly likable nor all that smart but that just makes streep s work all the more remarkable i think she is worth all or so of her oscar nominations about the film well there were a couple of interesting things i don t know much about australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues a pretty good film a bit different grade b
this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor i don t see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor i just don t think she did a very good job bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie they are going by train to davis s relatives house davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest but when they arrive home their is a nazi living there and their s not much either can do about it it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself 
this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it s impact on australian society it especially looks at the problem of innuendo gossip and expectation when dealing with real life dramas one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings it s an issue that has to be constantly addressed the leads play the characters with depth personality and sensitivity and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based on fact individuals some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors it re enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals spoiler warning i have to say something very personal here in that i am actually an ex adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality and emotional heart i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers it captured the themes of the story brilliantly i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to play the best case for their character they could while this is especially apt for this story i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well 
once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended you ll find that it s not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable it s also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who don t come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they don t really go beyond the standard stuff this movie s story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture i understand that it is quite close to the truth there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to any fellow fan of such 
meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense based on the book evil angels and titled so in its australian release a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch it presents a scenario that s all too real for us in america the witch hunt against a person deemed an easy target lindy chamberlain was this woman being someone who spoke her mind someone who didn t play the sympathy card and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn t kill her own child the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece and through it all lindy remained as stoic as ever even when her husband michael was falling apart this stance of course is the power of strength as unsympathetic as it may look like and people happen to react strongly to that they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn not sit there and look blank people don t understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold but not unfeeling woman one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty because of her sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair someone has to or the chamberlains would be too detached and no one wants to see that except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news media they ll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public 
spoilers following i picked up the book evil angels when it first came out knowing nothing of the case just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain s guilt the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors and picked up by the press of the arterial spray the actelone plates dr james cameron s certainty that the collar was cut with scissors that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up bloody hand print etc all quite convincingly after all these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn t apparent to me at all it was also highly technical evidence difficult for a layman to understand to this point beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didn t believe it was possible the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists whose origins made them appear to be a cult and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt were it not for dedicated selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony finding azaria s clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail the book shook me for that reason and i ve been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone s guilt ever since excepting oj of course i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don t think it could have been done better i ve always liked sam who i could identify with completely and meryl was perfect as always beautiful photography haunting music i think it s not only a very good but a very important movie too bad it didn t receive more publicity at the time it was released 
this is a true story of an australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears meryl streep is excellent as always and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn t particularly likable the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam sheppard murder case in ohio during the s these real life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge headline stating why isn t sam sheppard in jail the prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure and sheppard was tried and convicted only after years in jail was he exonerated i love movies which tell a true story do it in an interesting way and make an important point in the process this is one of those movies other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include hurricane the thin blue line and breaker morant in particular the latter is another australian film which is highly recommended 
 a cry in the dark is a masterful piece of cinema haunting and incredibly though provoking the true story of lindy chamberland who in witnessed a horrific sight seeing her month old baby being brutally taken from their family s tent while camping on the austrailian outback azaria the baby was never seen again and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy as she always does but the one thing that helps a cry in the dark never fall flat is the brilliant direction a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case tears are brought to the eyes the concept is nothing less then terrifying and afterwards you are left haunted but also inspired 
watch on the rhine is one of the best anti nazi propaganda films made during world war two paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was i would recommend this film to those interested in that era and of course the fabulous films of the late great ms bette davis 
i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced mins of roll roll is about a country boy mat toby malone who has dreams of becoming a sports star mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george damien robertson well that was the plan anyway george is involved with a gangster tiny john batchelor and is making a delivery for him needless to say mat gets dragged into george s world i thought it was great how mat teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches mat how to relax and enjoy life a little toby and damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job every character in the movie complimented each other very well the two cops were great david ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters pando from two hands one of the other things that i liked about roll was that it showcased the cities that i grew up and lived in for years perth and fremantle it was good to see sights and landmarks that i grew up with especially the old ferris wheel this rocks n rolls
a country boy aussie rules player mat goes to the city the night before an all important afl trial match where he is to be picked up by his cousin and then things go wrong his no hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan shark drug dealer tiny who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively australian needless to say mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos and it isn t long before thoughts of tomorrow s match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night s frantic events unravel accomplished western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country boy mat and successfully plays a part well below his age best support comes from john batchelor as tiny and an entertaining role by david ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events roll is fast paced often funny and a very worthwhile use of an hour 
i ve just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be toby malone s performance really stood out i found myself actually caring about what happens to matt throughout the whole of the film which itself is a lot of fun very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters quite an achievement considering it s short running time there are plenty of good twists throughout as well it will keep you guessing until the end other characters to watch out for are the totally insane tiny and the sneaky attractive jesse it may not have the huge budget of a hollywood blockbuster but don t let that put you off you could do a lot worse than checking this out you won t regret it good fun 
in i had just moved to the us from ceylon i was and had been married for a little over three years and was beginning to come out as a lesbian i saw this movie on an old black and white tv with terrible reception alone and uninterrupted in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story i was living in a small house in tucson arizona and it was summertime like everyone else here i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth and its residue of fragile magic and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday i ll keep checking in i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel s the other side of venus it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy 
the previous reviewer has said it exactly i saw it once was enchanted saw it a second time when it was re broadcast within a week or two of the first airing i still remember some of the scenes the setting is the opening of the th century the war referred to in the title is world war i one of the scenes was set in a women only section of a public place which was an interesting historical note the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all time great movie moments i don t think of this as a gay movie it s an interesting and tender period love story where the two principals happen to be women i would love to see this movie again i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd 
it s been a while since i ve watched this movie and the series but now i m refreshing my memory this was a very funny movie based on the classic series johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm bo and luke sneak around hogg s local construction site and find samples of coal they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip mine hazzard county unless the dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin daisy my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn t right for the part of boss hogg and sheriff rosco p coltrane was way too serious other than that i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard 
what is wrong with you people if you weren t blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head of course the film isn t a masterpiece i don t think it was aiming to be it was fun and funny i never watched the show when i was younger i only recently saw one episode and when i watched the movie i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere the movie seats were practically shaking and the car sequences were good because it didn t bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in fast furious and jessica simpson is plain hot i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences all in all i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd people enjoy it for what it is 
i m a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show and i really enjoyed this flick i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters it s funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like lame plot and it s much cruder than the show does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot and as far as the plot goes it was the perfect dukes plot in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren t exactly like their small screen versions they do a great job and work very well together i wasn t too keen on burt s boss hogg though and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe in the movie roscoe is a little scary and who didn t have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard folks allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia bikinis and car chases you won t be sorry it s just a great dumb movie 
it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful colorful production and to adults for a literate script fine production values good casting acting all bound together with a fine rozsa score two roughly contemporary films accomplish this thief of baghdad and the adventures of robin hood some of the back story on this production is fascinating this production commenced in england in the summer of moved to hollywood and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts the producer alexander korda was subsequently knighted in here is a unique case of the intersection of art commerce and politics by all means secure a good cd of this film for your library 
a magical journey concocted by alexander korda and michael powell these two titans of the british cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece some of the most ravishing early technicolor a sublime and shimmering miklos rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of sabu the theatrical and malevolent villainy of conrad veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of june duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well miles malleson who plays duprez father the sultan of basra also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose don t miss this one since posting the above comments i have obtained the recently released dvd and can honestly say i d never seen the picture properly until viewing this dvd version the clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that i was stunned this amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer again a must see 
this was usually producer alexander korda s advice on set to many of his underlings the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out pushing it to six for john kobal s book the top movies his survey of film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach th place a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half way mark the outbreak of the second world war saw the movie s production shifted around england and america eventually seeing completion in and winning three technical oscars like citizen kane it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love the special effects outstanding for the time are still reasonable and actually hold up if you squint but it s not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions among them is an amusing horse constructed out of a kit model which when a key is inserted up it s rear end begins to fly there s also a killer toy of the six armed goddess kali perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her and a quite horrific looking giant spider also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as in a superb moment of cinematic conceit a djinn genie nearly a thousand feet tall ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature and adds an element of danger to the proceedings and look out for the moment where he s tricked back into his bottle john justin does well as the arabic king who for some strange reason has an english accent and a stiff upper lip sabu the astonishingly muscled year old is near namesake abu a likeably cocky thief after they cross paths with the evil jaffer conrad veidt justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmed s justin s perspective we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues in truth the second half is someway the better being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature three small songs pepper the piece though as the film lasts for minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient i wouldn t classify this as a musical it s all great fun justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads veidt is the boo hiss villain and abu is the youthful irrepressible robber it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of s english movies but once you ve sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in quite commendable 
although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special if you ve never seen this film before you ll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney s aladdin cribbed from the film they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers i ve given the film an out of instead of a out of ten which is where a good portion of this film dwells because in the final minutes the film falls apart in the pacing everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting it doesn t kill the film but it does weaken it still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie 
i have seen this film several times and watched it today on tcm solely because of geraldine fitzgerald she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her probably in wuthering heights or more years ago the real star in this movie however is paul lukas and he deserved all the accolades he got he makes it clear whether we like it or not that the end justifies the means naziism had to be stopped and anything that helped do it was good he gave his children a line about being bad and that they should not be bad but as he said earlier when conversing with adults he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do some people think his victim was a nazi but i don t think so i think he was only after the money his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him one interesting point in the film and presumably also in the play is the fact that muller lucas is a german while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii there was considerable anti german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi soviet pact after all the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians i think however that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later after watch on the rhine was released the title is something of a play on words as the watch is looking west from germany in fact watch am rhein was a german army marching song used in wwii but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own wach am rhein all the other actors did an excellent job here although bodo was too much there are children like him i am surprised he did not give his father s secret away in real life he may very well have done so 
when i read other comment i decided to watch this movie first cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli good enough film very intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia second story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you ll like in my opinion third final chapter is not special or interesting it s regular like other action movies finally i recommend to watch this movie and i hope you ll love it enjoy d
probably the finest fantasy film ever made sumptuous colour spectacular sets incredible spot on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands but here the poetic dialog is deftly sensitively spoken the humour is subtle and delightful as well doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one along with the four feathers one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films and one of the finest motion pictures ever made a true compelling classic 
i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess as any kid would be i was delighted with the imagination inventiveness and energy of the film several years later i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years in addition to the script the production transcends the fantasy genre this is korda the storyteller at his very best when you see thief as a child you know that you`ve had a great time when you see thief as an adult you know that you`ve seen a masterpiece it`s as timeless as the story it treats an amazing work thomas mccarthy

despite having different directors this fantasy hangs together remarkably well it was filmed in england nowhere near morocco in studios and on a few beaches at the outbreak of war everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song i want to be a bandit can t you understand it it remains a favourite of many people 
this film was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it s quality while i grew up this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well the only drawback there is is that one can not see past the bad effects compared to the effects nowadays like one could when one was a child i remembered nothing of those effects of course it had been about ten years since i d seen this film when i was about eleven years old who then watches effects one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the th century coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film there is comedy romance and adventure all in one which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern it succeeds in not being dusty and old all of that is mainly due to the great story the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors in that department sabu as abu and conrad veidt as jaffar stand out providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part great film and although an oldie definitely a goldie i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday out of 
abu the thief of bagdad helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames sir alexander korda s london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights replete with swords sorcery it gave audiences in a short respite from the headlines it also is a fine piece of film making featuring good acting and an intelligent script conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it playing the evil magician jaffar his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days here is a villain worth watching as the boyish thief sabu is perfectly cast in this his third film while not a hero in the typical sense of the word his character is certainly heroic in deed action the rest of the cast do fine work john justin is both energetic sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way sabu gets a significant part of the action when he s not transformed into a dog but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra coveted by two very different men appearing late in the film massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra forever dithering on about his mechanical toys malleson was also responsible for the film s screen play dialogue aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend mary morris later an exceptional stage actress plays the dual roles of jaffar s accomplice and the six armed silver dancer the film was begun in britain but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast the art direction in vibrant technicolor is most attractive especially the fairy tale architecture in blues whites pinks born sabu dastagir in sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysore s stables when he was discovered by korda s company and set before the cameras his first four films elephant boy the drum the thief of bagdad jungle book were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films black narcissus being the one great exception his final movie walt disney s a tiger walks was an improvement but it was too late sabu had died of a heart attack in late only years of age 
an utterly beautiful film one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do in thief s case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time by the s my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art house cinema when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa s stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne after escaping with a little thief played by sabu ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for sabu and love not only conquers but annihilates everything the special effects must have been mesmerising in but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from years later anyway if i m requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide hall s suitably romantic song the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend in fact the stunning colours throughout sabu and rozsa s triumphant but still wistful finale conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever this and casablanca and then died john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted but the parts didn t call for a huge range of emotions only pure love mattered there s a couple of mildly violent images in it but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a positive message it s only a pity that nowadays little kids don t watch this instead of the porn they prefer one of my top film favourites i can t recommend this too much may it be shown to the end of time 
the story of the boy thief of bagdad as it was once spelled has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in who starred douglas fairbanks in the first silent rendering of thief of bagdad to less imposing more recent attempts the best however remains s version which for its time was a startling magical panoply of top quality special effects those effects still work their charm no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief abu john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier jaffar played by a sinister conrad veidt the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent he and the boy abu suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado like black swirl lawrence w butler and tom howard howard incidentally did the special effects for the version of this film both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting justin s ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he s very good for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there s a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind still i don t think anyone under eight ought to see thief of bagdad this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present it was great to see computer besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them thief of bagdad is a pre war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases this is one of the best of its kind 
i have to agree with mr caruso jr lanza s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it see the film you ll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn t good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring 
watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non aggression pact signed in august of so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line the line didn t change until a couple of months later lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work the play watch on the rhine ran from april to february for performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler eric roberts as the youngest son lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas lukas pulled an award hat trick in winning an oscar a golden globe and the new york film critics for best actor probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against humphrey bogart for casablanca gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls mickey rooney in the human comedy and walter pidgeon for madame curie every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was lukas s nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas s wife was given to bette davis davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it it s the same reason she did the man who came to dinner a much lighter play than this one davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe davis lukas and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war they re made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren the fly in this ointment are some other house guests a friend of davis s from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas s anti fascist background his suspicions are quite correct it s the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they ve become lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there his health has not been the same since his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes those decisions affect all the other members of the cast adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman s significant other coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell kurt katch clyde fillmore erwin kalser and rudolph anders coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti fascist classic casablanca though it s an item firmly planted in those specific times watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti fascist message that bears repeating infinitely 
the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan opera indeed i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso check a vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should stick to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano 
this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as for the music what more can be said other than that lanza s voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events for example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books available concerning his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie enjoy i know that i sure did 
the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most movergoers were stay at homes watching their new motorola televisions almost all recent box office figures are false because they fail to adjust inflation obviously today s movies will dominate in it cost c to at radio city c to c first run at loew s palace in washington dc or c to c in neighborhood runs what counts is the number of people responding to the picture not unadjusted box office media spin the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso really not a great story anyway and threw it in the trash instead of the movie s focus was on the music thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best ever historic opera singer enrico caruso the result was a wonderful movie too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating too fat to play the student prince edmund purdom took his place with lanza s voice dubbed in and with the formerly handsome and not fat lanza pictured in the advertising if you want to see the great caruso it s almost always on ebay for or less don t be put off by the low price as it reflects only the easy availability of copies not the quality of the movie 
i like it because of my recent personal experience especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives but they did enjoy themselves i e what they were the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities this made the conversations between the characters interesting not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story the end was not quite important after all you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie movies are supposed to be enjoyable this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it i am on a journey too the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions 
jesse and celine ethan hawke and julie delpy are two strangers on a european train the two come from widely different backgrounds he s american and she s french after they talk a bit on the train jesse manages to get celine to get off the train and explore vienna with him during the next several hours the two wander vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other but will this newfound relationship last past sunrise this wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline written and directed by richard dazed and confused linklater before sunrise never bores because of its small cast in fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans 
amazing movie that in theory should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding instead of relying on clich s and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments the lead characters are not perfect and so relating to them as people you could know is easy the movie is not trying to pull laughs or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel a moving thought provoking funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany s will soften even the hardiest heart 
i m not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good i was stunned easily the most romantic thing i ve ever seen in my life stunning brilliant sweet funny and full of heart the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they re a couple the movies grabs you right away and doesn t let go you can t look away nor can you stop listening to them even the little moments just melt your heart this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever a masterpiece 
i m not even sure what to say about this film it s one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa like dancing about architecture it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write the ending is left open and ambiguous no happy ending here just mystery no profound life lessons just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings romantic love out of watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger 
i must admit that at the beginning i was sort of reticent about watching this movie i thought it was this stupid little romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie still i watched it and i was amazed before sunrise is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth we are sentenced to death or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity or that we humans can afford sometimes to live in fairy tales the ending was wonderfully chosen we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six o clock in vienna s station in our optimism we sincerely hope so the actors acted in a very good manner so that i began to believe that i myself could live a love story just like this 
the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love by far the most romantic at least one of them movie of all times 
my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships as a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending hrs the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with on the plot front making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer s and director s mind what the actors bring out is what becomes of them right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify to become the character the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story here both the actors do just the right job kudos and before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful 
i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of before sunrise and before sunset and saw both films in a row without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately after sleeping it over i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter and i shall explain why before sunrise introduces us with then young actors ethan hawke reality bites dead poets society only at the time of the film s release and julie delpy the three colors trilogy then although looking much younger he is a promiscuous american writer touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend she is a young french student on her way home to paris they meet on the budapest vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love the film has s written all over it back then technology was leaping rapidly the new millennium with all it s hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future the characters of jesse hawke and celine delpy with all their flaws and inconsistencies celine s accent if by mistake or on purpose was half american half french and it swinged from one spectrum to the other breaking the character s credibility were a mirror of the time watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement acting all clich d and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well is what really made this movie work for me the fact that the director doesn t let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while all in all sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna a well told classical romantic rendezvous and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future 
this is a slow moving story no action no crazy suspense no abrupt surprises if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey dovey romance don t waste your time and money on the other hand if you re into dialog masterful story telling thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert though because the pace the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood it s truly fantastic i really mean that ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but thankfully the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural warm and tender they act and feel each other out from the very beginning making you feel as an intruder in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence still it did not ruin the movie the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it s charm and ultimately it s power bottom line the movie s flow is slow the dialog is fascinating the story builds gently systematically and substantive the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding 
after a chance encounter on the train a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna discussing life and love the primary reason to see before sunrise is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines as celine this sexy brainy soulful brown eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid twenties risking overstatement celine is practically the ideal woman unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural unpretentious introspective and selflessly loving we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak for her sincere intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating further her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar ethan hawke as jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob sort of a maynard g krebs of the nineties attempting to appear detached and nonchalant he sort of drags himself through certain shots his pants fit poorly his tee shirt is coming untucked his wavy dark hair his most attractive feature needs a good washing and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee nevertheless he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two week train ride around europe so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine his oft cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence we know he is getting somewhere after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes bars and silly diversions they agree that because they may never see one another again they should make the most of it jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up given his boundless luck in the romance department it is especially irksome when jessie as the very definition of a naive jerk foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp he contents himself with a half baked plan quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu to reunite at the same spot in half a year when the appointed time comes you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another perhaps even married and pregnant for whatever reason she probably won t show while jesse who ends up working at target or if he s lucky the local library will go back to vienna desperate to see her again only to wind up alone despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion before sunrise is a beautiful movie i highly recommend both it and the sequel before sunset 
this movie is intelligent that is more than most other movies it transcends the least common denominator stupid people will probably not appreciate it the story also relies heavily on dialogue it has some parallels to lost in translation although before sunrise is much brighter somehow less abstract and simply a lot better the script the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic the actors play absolutely brilliantly rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together the dialogue moves into very personal issues with the risk of becoming a little over the top it does however stay on the right side almost all the time although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors sometimes it yields great results and overall this movie is simply stupendous only very very rarely is love in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic every time that is achieved the result is fantastic i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect she still looks stunning in this film years after this is simply a gem of a movie that you can t miss one of the best movies i have seen from the s 
richard linklater s beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the s best thinking person s romantic movies julie delpy turns in one of the decade s most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger on a train ethan hawke the dialogue and there is oodles of it is sometimes meandering and overly precious but this portrait of two young wannabe lovers making a romantic intellectual and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing touching and insightful moments 
if you are a traveller if there is a fire burning into your heart if you d call home every place on earth but none of them can give you enough if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there see this movie and you ll find out a little but wonderful piece of life sitting next to you 
i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago but its concept interested me when i heard it an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking it sparked my interest but i never expected it to be this great before sunrise is a masterpiece and it s also one of the most romantic films on record to my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism of the s it s impossible to really talk too much about it since there is no real plot so to speak although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like my dinner with andre where there is a conversation but it s not just the conversation that matters but let me just say see it see it 
many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with the mortal storm or casablanca everyone is entitled to compare films they choose but the similarities of the mortal storm and watch on the rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut while the main comparative point brought out with casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in by the academy of motion picture arts and science because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar it does not strike me as totally wrong lukas had a good career in film both here and in england he is the villain in the lady vanishes and this performance was his best one bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine for instance he was ignored for sam spade in the maltese falcon and roy earle in high sierra two years earlier both of which were first rate performances and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c dobbs in the treasure of sierra madres the writer murder suspect in in a lonely place and captain philip francis queeg in the caine mutiny afterward he got it for charley in the african queen i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs but it did not happen but lukas was lucky he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career few can claim that to me the film to look at with watch on the rhine is based on another play script by hellman the searching wind they both look at america s spirit of isolationism in the s and s the searching wind is really looking at the whole inter war period while watch on the rhine set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii deals with a few weeks of time therefore it is better constructed as a play and more meaningful for it s impact the film has many good performances led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti nazi fighter courier davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play s activities coulouris as the selfish conniving but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald as coulouris wiser and sadder and fed up wife and kurt katch who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassy s gestapo chief about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis it has dialog with bite in it and what it says is quite true it also has moments of near poetry witness the scene towards the end when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis and says the new world has left the scene to the old world hellman could write very well at times given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films 
it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other ethan hawke jesse tape and julie delpy celine er tv series nicole this gal and guy will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years jesse and celine have great conversation and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in and if you have viewed this film you will feel the same way 
i want c line and jessie go further in their relationship i want to tell them that they were made for each other that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached this is about love but not stupid things like in notting hills or those kind of movie this is life and i did believe in them i did believe they were falling this was so clever and touching i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there i want to go to vienna i want to see them as soon as possible again i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake a concept but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere somehow and some when something could really happen i m french and didn t know very well july delpy despite kieslowski three colors white now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting i saw before sunset the sequel in paris a few days before i saw before sunrise and their is no matter they are both masterpieces proof that you don t need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings i m sorry for my english which i m trying to best franck in france
before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation richard linklater s romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people the film depicts romance in all it s glory but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that s as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to with just one problem the problem of time while most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental hollywood romance which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders the story follows two people jesse an american and celine a french girl that meet on a train into vienna they instantly connect and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna before sunrise works principally for two reasons realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life this allows the characters to be free and it s easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are and not merely because they re the protagonists this kind of realism is hard to capture as at the end of the day we as the audience know that they re watching a film and not observing real life but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen a truly great script cannot work on it s own and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice and although i m not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke on viewing this film there is nothing you can do but give them both respect i don t know whether they were in character or just playing themselves but when a film is this good it hardly matters in a film like this it is the writing that s the most important thing and contained within the script are several observations about life most of which i personally could relate to this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters but it also manages to expose what true love is along with several other aspects of life the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing everyone is different and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and that s the case with the musings in this script adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna the city itself isn t really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental before sunrise is what it is and what it is is pure cinematic brilliance 
this movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of alzheimer s or who are in the formative stages i would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line 
i wasn t expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you d expect to be living next door they are ordinary flesh and blood people not like the typical hollywood fare they face an all too common problem debilitating illness but the story line grips the heart with a powerful lesson casting script direction and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire 
this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family well acted and well directed if there were any flaws i d have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again what about all people of all cultural backgrounds i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes
a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie it s based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film really made you think about how you d respond if you were in the shoes of the characters recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent spouse or family member in other words everyone though the production isn t quite hollywood quality no big special effects still the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill you don t want to miss this 
i just watched this movie for the second time and enjoyed it as much as the first time it is a very emotional and beautiful movie with good acting and great family values inspiring and touching 
when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film yet having read the content i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie the effect surprised me totally i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me a vow to cherish is without any doubt one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema first the entire content is particularly educational it has something to offer to the modern audience pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions is there a need for christ in our times does love still matter what for is there faith what is the logics of burden and suffering in life is there really someone by my side i can always trust the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us second the movie is exceptionally humane the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions is it better for kyle david denman and teri megan paul to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home is it better for john ken howard to leave ellen barbara babcock his sick wife and start a new happy life with julia donna bullock a woman he falls in love with in fact ellen no longer recognizes him yet he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity had john s rebellious brother phil d david morin better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life phil s prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where when or how they live third the movie is a great portrayal of family not very popular nowadays there are problems yet there is always something more powerful that gets these people together this something is love and trust i know that it may seem a bit idealistic not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that nevertheless it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one fourth the entire film focuses on people s mutual help if we want to live happy lives in our society we must understand one thing we have to help one another alexander ossie davis is an example of such attitude at the beginning of the movie we see him talk to john about praying later he helps his brother alexander is a kinda angel that is sent to john and his family isn t it possible that we may become angels to one another fifth the artistic features are also worth attention performances barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role she does a perfect job consider for instance the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband picture the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves autumn while the sunshine love spreads everywhere i interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow this can always be illuminated by light and joy a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe at the end i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do kyle to his uncle phil yes he john brighton lives according to the bible but nobody forces you to do so yet according to what rules do you live 
i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business who are now still trying to become adults no more fans groupies money etc and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight it is almost like they have to begin anew this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the s and s are going through now and that s where i find the film sad and depressing but it portrays the life of an old rock star abandoned and lost in a believable way the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren outrageous and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for this film is a must have for folks in their s who have seen the rise and fall of bands people who knew the members and have watched them hurt as age creeps in and popularity fades this is an almost perfect movie sad but in a way positive because of the whales a must see 
i was amazingly impressed by this movie it contained fundamental elements of depression grief loneliness despair hope dreams and companionship it wasn t merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music he finds a companion who comes with her own issues claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star yet he has musical genius he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate while things around him literally go to ruins his focus is creating his whale music in fact it becomes an obsession for him claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay she finds hidden talents while being in des company she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her she learns to trust him over a period of time these two find love with one another not the mind blowing sex infused kind of passion but a love where friendship and understanding means more for two people who have been hurt they find trust together 
my first exposure to whale music was the rheostatics album of the same name that i bought around i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album which remains in a prominent place in my collection was inspired by canadian author paul quarrington s book i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it an amazing read i have since re read the book numerous times each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale music i found the film in on video i haven t had a lot of good experiences with canadian film but this one worked for me the role of claire could have been cast differently but overall i think that paul quarrington s vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius the movie deals with family relationships love and finding someone who understands i would strongly recommend whale music to not only music fans but anyone who has ever lost something or someone and tried to find their way back to the world 
walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema how do you get laughs out of other people s misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long well this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz as well i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it and marijuana illegal since those other races used it undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world an extraordinary dvd extra commentary two of them in fact run thru the whole movie with both the actors and then again with the writers i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take what a hoot don t miss it stars
 saving grace is never riotously funny but it delivers quite a few good laughs and i enjoyed it to a significant degree brenda blethyn is a fine actress and does a good job at portraying widower grace who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts the supporting cast also does a fine job french actor tchecky karyo has a funny little role the premise alone is appealing the idea of an over the hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough and the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then of course there are flat moments like one where two elderly women mistaken grace s marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work that was a mindless gag that didn t quite take off the film s tone is downbeat and occasionally dull but i got enough laughs to give this english import a recommendation my score out of 
after her oscar nominated turn in secrets lies brenda blethyn starred in the equally great saving grace and let me tell you this is not the sort of movie that you find every day after her husband commits suicide grace trevethyn brenda blethyn discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt fortunately she finds a way to make ends meet marijuana that s right grace starts cultivating it every aspect of this movie was played to great effect there isn t a dull moment anywhere in it and i sure didn t see that end scene coming but anyway you gotta see this movie you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it if nothing else it might function as a good lesson about knowing one s finances but of course there s a lot more to it than that 
for muslim women in western africa married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour but equally they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal an attitude which of course enables it to continue fortunately the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children what is notable apart from the uplifting central story is how in spite of their informality the courts are actually pragmatically progressive if a case is actually bought the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life style which aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america and while i concede that this comment may betray naivet on my part this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin english they speak overall this is a terrific little film and much more fun to watch than you might imagine 
a delightful gentle comedic gem until the last five minutes which degenerate into run of the mill british tv farce the last five minutes cost it points in my rating despite this major plot and style flaw it s worth watching for the character acting and the unique cornwall setting many fine little bits to savor like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit card made more piquant when we re not quite sure the card is not maxed 
great actors an oscar nominee actress stunning scenery good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag and thats quite big this film was brilliant it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were well side splitting i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the stoned ladies in the tea shop scene well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year if not of all time 
it s a bit easy that s about it the graphics are clean and realistic except for the fact that some of the fences are d but that s forgiveable the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n games the sounds are magnificant everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times but it s the same for every platform game like banjo kazooie and donkey kong i got this game as a christmas present in and since then i have dutifully gotten stars over times 
mario s first foray into the world of dimensions is incredible miyamoto s masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo when it was released in and it still holds all of it s charm today this game is an instant classic that set the standard for d adventure platform games 
this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you don t need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn t close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future 
although super mario isn t like the rest of the games in the series it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games games with this much replay value are few and far between plus this game has so much variety there are levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks the game isn t very challenging but its lack of challenge doesn t take away from the game at all once you beat it you ll want to erase your game and start again and its just as much fun the second time or third time or two hundredth time a must own for any nintendo owner and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 
one of the funnest mario s i ve ever played the levels are creative there are fluid controls and good graphics for its time there s also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight sometimes the levels get frustrating and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still need to get more accomplished to fight a boss it can be annoying another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time it can be a pain in certain situations if your a big time mario fan this ones for you even if your not a huge fan of him i d still recommend this one its a big game and getting what you need can take a while but it s very satisfying good for playing in short bursts of time it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine 
this game is amazing really you should get it if you don t have it although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out i believe that this game will always be a classic it s just as good a super mario world or so when i was young my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did it s not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential it s fun entertaining and challenging everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics well it did come out in rock on eva mario luigi and yoshi nintendo is the best 
if you have any clue about jane austen s production you ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage marriage and marriage in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring but i like austen s characters because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow she s very good in her leading role also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious 
a slight charming little movie to be sure but a superbly crafted one gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue this came out around the time of sense and sensibility and i m sure i don t know why that one garnered all the oscar attention emma is jane austen s most accessible and least stuffy story told well 
lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane austen s satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial th century england northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up and i thought it didn t rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the s and s do very good results 
wrapped in gorgeous english country backgrounds emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways emma gwyneth paltrow is a graceful intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess and confidant to a marriage which emma takes the credit in matchmaking eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her she decides to match the vicar mr elton alan cummings with her pretty young friend harriet toni collette the result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out with emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought the film is full of jane austen s witty and wry characterizations gwyneth paltrow is at her best portraying this maiden of a restrained polite society with wit and ease her growing romance with the unparalleled mr knightley jeremy northam is the heart of this film mr knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films he is incredibly handsome in a modest relaxed way that is irresistible he is certainly well matched to gwyneth paltrow their charming friendship that began when he was and she was an infant has blossomed as he a family friend matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more with a wry look or understated jab at emma northam s knightley is a delight to watch other wonderful characterizations include the comic juliet stevenson greta scacchi ewan mcgregor polly walker and the talkative spinster miss bates who is very funny seeming shorter and more flowing than most jane austin adaptations emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment 
this is a good adaptation of austen s novel good but not brilliant the cinematography is inventive crossing at times the border to gimmickry but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes given that the entire story is dialogue driven the acting is competent ms paltrow is aloof as her character requires but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions in other words she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match making endeavours some of the supporting cast is guilty of over acting very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures personally i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton to no fault of his own except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley dolly in the high life that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level 
romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england in this light hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue the ladies were charming and elegant and the gentlemen dashing `emma based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role a self appointed matchmaker emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend harriet toni collette but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying meanwhile her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr knightley jeremy northam whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma s and lend some needed balance to the proceedings and emma so concerned with what is right for others neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all her own the world goes round and love abounds but emma is about to miss the boat luckily for her however the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings now if she can but stop long enough to realize it but as everyone who has known true love knows matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant depending upon the slightest thing and while romance is at hand for emma she must first recognize it and seize the moment mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful feel good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world there may be an air of frivolity about it but in retrospect this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is in all honesty to just about anyone love and with mcgrath s impeccable sense of pace and timing it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable it s a pleasant affecting film with a wonderful cast that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place it s light fare but absorbing and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow the winsome paltrow who won the oscar for best actress for `shakespeare in love two years after making this one seems comfortable and right at home in this genre she personifies all things british and does it with such naturalness and facility that it s the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether she s simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner very reminiscent of audrey hepburn yet paltrow is unique as an actor she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated with such films as `hard eight `hush and `a perfect murder that she can play just about any part effectively and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own but it s with characters like emma that she really shines she is so expressive and open and her personality is so engaging that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch regardless of the part she is playing and for emma she is absolutely perfect jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley and like paltrow seems suited to the genre in the right role that is his performance in the more recent `the golden bowl in which he played an italian prince was less than satisfying here however he is perfect he is handsome and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real like colin firth s mr darcy in the miniseries `pride and prejudice northam has created a memorable character with his own mr knightley also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette as emma s friend harriet smith and alan cumming as the reverend elton respectively collette and cumming create characters who are very real people and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema and to films of any genre the supporting cast includes greta scacchi mrs weston denys hawthorne mr woodhouse sophie thompson miss bates kathleen byron mrs goddard phyllida law mrs bates polly walker jane fairfax and ewan mcgregor frank churchill an uplifting elegant film `emma is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness and even if it s only through the magic of the silver screen it s nice to be able to escape to such a world as this if only for a couple of hours as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit and that s the magic of the movies i rate this one 
a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association wla of kumba in southwest cameroon in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence in this muslim culture where men have always been sovereign over women according to sharia law one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children after years of failed efforts leaders of the wla began recently to score a few wins and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories the leaders of this legal reform movement are vera ngassa a state prosecutor and beatrice ntuba a senior judge court president both play themselves in this film which may contain footage shot spontaneously though i imagine much of it if not all consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera four cases are reviewed and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film two cases involve repeated wife beating with forcible sex in one case another involves forced sex upon a year old girl and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child age by an aunt one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials the outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children the perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and or fines the divorce is granted the aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender neutral when it comes to enforcing the law also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties including those found guilty are treated this is a highly important and well made film of interest is the fact that one of the directors ms longinotto also co directed the film divorce iranian style which dealt with related themes in tehran in broken english with english subtitles my grade b 
what a delightful film accompanied by oscar winning composer rachel portman s lush emotional and dreamy music this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year incredible casting gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma toni collette was great as harriett smith the character who stole the film was miss bates she was mesmerizing to watch one finds oneself on the edge of ones seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr woodhouse for sending that lovely quarter hind of pork pork mother she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother mrs bates played by emma thompson s mother phyllida law who looks forlorn and lost the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one s heart ripped out to her on her behalf it is a classic scene one to be rewound and played over over the ending is right up there with sense sensibility and provides one of life s greatest lessons about how one should marry one s best friend i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself i adored it 
i love this movie my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film we had no idea what it was going to be about but it turned out spectacular thumbs up i liked how the film was shot and the actors were very funny if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won t this movie is definitely on my top list of good movies do you really think nothing is bouncy 
whether it s a good movie or not films of this kind has to be made i think it remembers me of i love huckabees a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with isabelle huppert being sodomized by a young american in a mud pond in a merry sadistic masochist way i hope the director will go on stepping across the border as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made were not always subtle some of the scenes were unhappily kind of tarte la cr me like a childish slapstick speaking about script and cinematography the color of cube was black nothing is white more cheerful surprisingly than the former films of natali 
yes i m going with the on this and here s why in the last few years i have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget then i stumble upon nothing looked interesting wasn t expecting much though i was wrong this was probably one of the funniest movies i have ever had the chance to watch dave and andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember but not over complex to the point of missing the joke i don t want to remark on any of the actual scenes because i do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once with more and more pointless concepts coming into movies you know like killer military jets and fresh remakes that are ruining old classics this movie will make you happy to say it s ok to laugh at nothing 
this is a good movie but it is not recommended if you don t like intelligent movies it s about two guys that wish that the world would go away and that s exactly what they get the acting is great the ending was not predictable and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger i actually like b movies or the grim adventures of billy and mandy one note if you notice this this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors make it two notes wait after the credits trust me on this one enjoy the movie 
i thought this was an awesome movie the theme song is sweet anyway the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning when everything should have been normal it was very weird and unrealistic the big cable company is mainly what i m talking about apart from that the movie was very creative i think that all the acting was well done the actors acted out their characters personalities perfectly everything fit together well it really is a shame that their isn t a soundtrack that would have been great because this is a canadian film and because it is one of my favorites i give this movie a out of 
tweaked a little bit nothing could be a children s film it s a very clever concept touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think of what goes against everything more than literally nothing nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives all that s left is what they don t hate and a big empty white space it s hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot it focuses on pretty much one subject but that s prime vincenzo natali territory if you ve seen cube you know already that he tends to like that type of situation the nothing in this movie is apparently infinite space but natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic if only because there s literally nothing else and nowhere else to go the actors sell it although you can tell these guys are friends anyway two actors from cube return here worth and kazan but are entirely different characters they change throughout the story and while they re not the strongest actors in the world they re at least believable the reason i say this could be a children s film under the right tweaks is because aside from a few f bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids so i find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore especially considering there isn t very much of it this could ve gotten a pg rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue there is very little objectionable about this film but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it i only say that s a shame because not because i support censorship but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure at any rate this is a reasonably entertaining film albeit with a few dragged out scenes but for literally being about nothing and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film 
a light hearted comedy nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing anything you don t like be it a stack of bills a bad memory or even hunger can disappear at your wish they approached this movie very well and with an enjoyable starring duo there were only a few things i didn t like about nothing and they weren t even part of the main movie first the post credits scene and yes there is one good for a chuckle but what were they trying to accomplish with that i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing instead we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion and wasn t really necessary nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame second the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd and like others have already said this it promotes a horror movie that never came oh well poor marketing i guess if you see this at your movie rental store take a look because nothing is a great movie to watch if you have a big screen though you might want to wear shades 
well cube vincenzo s first movie was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that i ve ever seen when talking about movies they had just one scenery a bunch of actors and a plot so what made it so special were all the effective direction great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth his second movie cypher was all about its story but it wasn t so good as cube but here are the characters being tested like rats again nothing is something very interesting and gets vincenzo coming back to his cube days locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room but instead of a thriller sci fi even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that nothing is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we re living once again vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing actors and a blinding white scenario that s all you got most part of time and you don t need more than that while cube is a claustrophobic experience and cypher confusing nothing is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget of course that the movie fails sometimes but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws there s nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that i had in movies since cube 
having seen cube i ve been a fan of vincenzo natali s work natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster instead he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways so much in fact that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape or in the case of nothing a large empty expanse where there is nothing the advert had me hooked instantly it seemed so simple take two characters who no one likes and send them to a world where there is nothing natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist in fact the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film there s nothing there but also something there it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so therefore upon watching the film i laughed every now and again whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused if i may take a minute to give the film some praise where the film excels on is the concept it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing and to put two characters there not two brilliant minded characters who will philosophise and work out their surroundings but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are another strong point is the film s cinematography though at first this may not seem it where each wall north earth south west up and down is just a white plane a perception of depth becomes faulty it is hard to determine where things are placed in the mis en scene the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens but for the most part the camera is placed so that two characters or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background allowing a sense of depth to be realised however this film does lack in certain areas the film is relatively short but even so after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot we can also argue that the acting is once again questionable these two characters are in a sense unlikeable therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters however on a flip side of that the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough but there is something lacking even so i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science fiction horror film it is much more of a comedy than that it is indeed worth watching though purely for the concept itself 
i just saw this at the toronto film festival and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again it is a character driven film and andrew and david are more than up to the task any discussion of the plot might be considered spoilers so i ll just say that the storyline is clever the acting is superb and the effects are amazing well filmed and well paced too one of the best films i have seen in ages and very refreshing in this summer of dreary movies it had the audience laughing the whole time see it if you can i particularly liked the candy bar candy bar scene 
if you want mindless action hot chicks and a post apocalyptic view of seattle then this is the show for you the concept of dark angel isn t anything new in fact there s controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finish jessica alba is smoking and max friends original cindy kendra are just as hot the fight scenes are getting better but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it in my opinion dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for but if you re looking for hard hitting award winning drama go watch the west wing or something 
the premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now we ve all heard or read about it in some kind of con text what would you do if you were all alone in the world what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes in fact the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew two room mates living in a run down house in the middle of a freeway system andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed just until straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them both of them get involved with crime andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesn t dare going out of the house dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues don t treat him very well and with the respect he deserves the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away and of course that is exactly what happens the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left nothing features an incredibly small cast in fact besides the first couple of shots from the film we only see dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller in the entire film it is clear that in order to pull this off the cast has to be more than up for the task because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well director of photography derek rogers also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it but we don t see it right away obviously this can t be an event driven film and it s not much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void and that s where some of the most hilarious scenes take place especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy bar now one could be thinking how does nothing look like well it looks like nothing indeed the entire world of nothing is white white no matter in what direction you look this is the weakness of this film after an hour or less it s getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it s more interesting to look at thank god there are some for example at times when the two lads due to the properties of nothing are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of tofu as andrew claims it s fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society one of the best parts of the film is the set production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this all in all the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching however the very best part of the film is the acting both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said there are just about no props in the film they are really on a bare stage with plenty of character development and some decent one liners clever dialogue at times hilariously stupid it all works to that end and this really moves the movie away from the low budget area to well crafted handwork let s talk a little about the visual effects because they are definitely worth mentioning nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film there s a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film and although the drews have milked that scene completely it s still fun to watch one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment they have the abilities to wish everything away so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear nothing is a bright and well lit movie it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead this is in fact one of their theories but nothing is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory we don t know where they are or what has happened to them we don t know if they will ever get out because the movie ends before we see anything like that the ending by the way is not as good as it could ve been it s rather easy to predict what is going to happen still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end it s a reasonably satisfactory one take hollow man kill bill cube epoch and lots of other films and you have nothing it really is an amalgam of different styles still there is no other film at least that i know of nothing is really like for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube he talks about him and andr bijelic having been room mates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out nothing could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story and to that end it s almost like one of the cube prequels what can i say i enjoyed nothing it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well made with tons of intelligent ideas still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is maybe if we have a nothing i can answer that question nothing is a great film but not as good as i expected it to be final rating 
jimmy cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage producer who is vigorously struggling against the upcoming talking movies this story of love deceit women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment the direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done the story never really got lost in this frantic pace some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesn t matter because when you look at this in a time frame it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that time jimmy cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film never loosing his composure as the ever working producer of previews made for the movie theaters as intros in this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business he was a broadway producer before he started this joan blondell is fabulous as the neglected love interest nan she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change the only problem i had with the film were the enormous productions at the end these were magnificent in itself beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced but they just didn t seem to fit in the story the only link they have to the main story is that cagney had to put on previews in days to get a contract and that s what he did i had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater in this way the sitting on a backyard fence was much more appropriate to the story the productions at the end seemed to drag this frantically paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing i was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then i realized there were another two coming up these sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well all in all a great film with a sour ending 
 footlight parade released viewed the ice cream cone is invented in new york kevin after a long and busy break we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros this time it s the ultra fast paced footlight parade starring james cagney as juggernaut stage producer chester kent i am certain that cagney was channeling berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible kent who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute joan blondell is also excellent as the acid tongued secretary turned love interest the ruby keeler dick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable one thing that baffled me was berkeley s performances themselves which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards obviously busby doesn t let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most over the top musical numbers he can possibly conjure i liked nearly all of this movie until the end with the shamelessly offensive number shanghai lil which as one can guess is about as stomach turning as racially distasteful performances come doug six movies in three months got to be a new record anyway this completes warner bros musical trilogy of preceded by nd street and gold diggers of i would definitely recommend watching all three in a row i wonder if james cagney was channeling busby berkeley while he was playing chester kent in this movie or if that the role as written was inspired by busby i hope it was it seems to make sense that berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way chester does the funny thing about cagney was that he didn t really look like a leading man in the traditional sense he was square headed and talked with an odd new york accent but the guy was quite versatile going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fast talking producer types we see here and he could dance basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor the rest of the cast has some familiar faces joan blondell returns and just about steals the show as cagney s loyal and lusting secretary dick powell and ruby keeler play the cute couple but seem to get less screen time than before billy barty pops up again as the mischievous imp the movie is typical of the more racy and adult oriented musicals of the pre code era as opposed to those of the s and s that were more family oriented and is an excellent climax of the warner musicals of that year the shanghai lil number not withstanding with keeler doing a poor job at looking chinese last film dinner at eight next film i m no angel 
such energy and vitality you just can t go wrong with busby berkley films and this certainly must be his best of course the choreography is wonderful but also the banter between cagney and blondell is so colorful and such a delight don t miss this one 
the wit and pace and three show stopping busby berkley numbers put this ahead of the over rated nd street this is the definitive s musical with a knockout frenetic performance from jimmy cagney one of the last releases before the motion picture production code was strictly enforced a must see 
never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely dick powell scott blair who had a great tenor voice and ruby keeler bea thorn james cagney plays the role as chester kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater s during the s chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs joan blondell nan prescott gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career enjoy 
i have a feeling that the warners bros depression era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years yes we are in the economic doldrums or have you been living under a rock and times look bleak but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles in the s film going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom footlight parade was one such film that audiences flocked to while this lloyd bacon directed musical doesn t quite capture the social issues of the time as gold diggers of does it s still a wonderful showcase of talent we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers but boy are they worth waiting for me yes little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress and her tapping is so so but busby s magical by a waterfall whisks her and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls into a dizzying water wonderland of course busby s numbers could never really be performed on a stage they defy limits of gravity for one thing and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough wisecracking non musical scenes and footlight also has james cagney in at the one of his all too few musicals really what couldn t this man do he even gets to take over from the leading man don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil who is really little ruby in china girl wig he co stars with joan blondell his adorable adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women until the final reel that is apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene 
an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early s audiences must ve been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle quite a contrast from his public enemy years earlier cagney does add spark interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline plot but the highlight of the movie is the elaborate production numbers back to back first with the conservative honeymoon hotel number then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling by a waterfall sequence followed by the closing shanghai lil sequence cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler the shanghai lil number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown anti climactic after the more exciting incredibly mind boggling by a waterfall choreography if i was the director i would ve inserted the shanghai lil number in the middle close with by a waterfall which blows the other numbers out of the water so to speak in my view the best of the numbers the production numbers are the frosting on the cake james cagney s performance is added decoration to the cake an outstanding musical achievement a star movie the ultimate musical well worth watching you won t be disappointed 
of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film from that point of view it is utter fantasy but who cares it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane battleship potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching films like this are worth a hundred citizen kanes it is about what cinema does best great camera work great settings and great performances the three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented keeping the best till last i will gladly watch this film again and again and again and 
the energetic young producer of theatrical prologues those staged performances usually musical that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days must deal with crooked competition fraudulent partners unfaithful lovers amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the footlight parade while closely resembling other warner s musical spectaculars notably the golddigger films this movie had a special attraction none of the others had jimmy cagney he is a wonder loose jointed and lithe as agile as any tomcat a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie cagney grabs the viewers attention never lets go powering the rapid fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma buoyant charm the rest of the cast gives their best as well joan blondell is perfect as the smart mouthed big hearted blonde secretary infatuated with cagney major quibble why wasn t she given a musical number dick powell ruby keeler once again play lovers onstage off the fact that her singing acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead guy kibbee hugh herbert are lots of fun as brothers in law both scheming to cheat cagney in different ways ruth donnelly scores as kibbee s wealthy wife a woman devoted to her handsome prot g s frank mchugh s harried choreographer is an apt foil for cagney s wit herman bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger mavens will spot little billy barty jimmy conlin maybe even john garfield during the musical numbers finally there s busby berkeley choreographer nonpareil his terpsichorean confections sprinkled throughout the decade of the s were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that depression audiences wanted to enjoy the big joke about berkeley s creations of course was that they were meant as part of the plot to be stage productions but no theater could ever hold these products of the master s imagination they are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera berkeley s musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches either a story often rather bizarre told with song dance or else stunning geometrically designed numbers eye candy featuring plentiful chorus girls overhead camerawork a romantic tune in a spasm of outr extravagance footlight parade climaxes with three berkeley masterworks `honeymoon hotel and its pre production code telling of a couple s wedding night `by a waterfall dozens of unclad females splashing floating diving in perfect patterns designs peer closely you ll see how the synchronous effects were achieved and finally `shanghai lil a fitting tribute to the talents of both cagney berkeley 
it has singing it has drama it has comedy it has a story it s one of the greatest movies ever made period if you can t enjoy this movie then you must be either asleep or in some kind of mental disarray in yankee doodle dandy james cagney sings and dances his way to an academy award but in this movie he is better this is james cagney at his quisessential best he s fast with the one liners he s fast with his feet it s nonstop action and the song and dance skits are classics especially shanghai lil and the supporting cast is great and the entire movie is upbeat fast moving and exudes confidence and even though this movie was made over years ago it s still watchable even today and of course this movie features miss ruby keeler who was married to al jolson she is the perfect partner for james cagney and dick powell too if you like upbeat fast paced movies with lots of singing and dancing this is the movie to watch 
 footlight parade is fascinating on so many levels there is no way the supposedly staged theater prologues could have been produced in any theater on earth of course think of the huge pools and three story tall fountains for by a waterfall for instance berkeley directed john garfield in they made me a criminal six years later and had the dead end kids singing by a waterfall as they took their showers shanghai lil is the best production number in the picture it s a catalog of s warner bros sensibilities note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a card section presentation of roosevelt s image there s also the nra eagle the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal fdr was the new president and hopes were so high that he d pull the nation out of the depression you d never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm of course warner bros wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f d r administration dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker lil she hardly even watches her feet as she dances which was one of her signature flaws the pre code stuff is fun the by a waterfall number is wonderful in that regard the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through times square with all its lights on the spread eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for years in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures 
footlight parade is among the best of the s musical comedy extravaganzas a snappy script and an all star cast including jimmy cagney the lovely joan blondell dick powell and ruby keeler make this film a cut above the rest directed and choreographed by the creative genius busby berkeley this film will have you grinning from ear to ear from start to finish busby of course is the undisputed master of the hollywood musical with gold diggers of and nd street to his credit as dance director footlight parade is graced by hundreds of scantily clad chorus girls a berkeley trademark the elaborate dance numbers were shot with only one camera and busby was the first director to film close ups of the dancers his obsession with shapely legs and rear view shots is amply demonstrated here the overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing our boy jimmy cagney plays chester kent a producer of prologues or short musical stage productions that were performed in movie theaters to entertain the audience before the talkies were shown he s surrounded by crooked partners a corporate spy and a gold digging girlfriend although cagney had a solid background in vaudeville this was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents joan blondell is memorable as cagney s wise cracking lovestruck secretary and ruby keeler is adorable as always the film climaxes with three outstanding production numbers honeymoon hotel the waterfall and shanghai lil each one a masterpiece and not likely to be duplicated in today s hollywood where so called special effects have replaced creative cinematography claudia s bottom line clever and erotic with some of the best musical production numbers ever put on celluloid a thoroughly enjoyable depression era romp

i enjoyed longstreet which followed in the steps of raymond burr s successful ironside tv series and was intended to give it competition but this show was canceled after one season because it was decided i believe wrongly that longstreet was not able to compete with mr burr s ironside i may add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable i hope that a box set of longstreet will appear writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on tv 
this is the best sci fi that i have seen in my years of watching sci fi i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today 
my cable tv has what s called the arts channel which is a catch as catch can situation sometimes sometimes films sometimes short clips of films or ballets and i came into this just as the bar scene came on where they tear up their coupons excellent exquisite ealing wins again my wartime glasgow raised mother would love this should i ever find a copy of it some of britain s best artists from mr holloway to wayne and radford and the delicious miss rutherford having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the home office loved the last scene where as soon as they are back in england the temperature plummets and it rains 
my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer today a writer and journalist has put forward the theory that just as british film makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called thatcher s britain the ealing comedies were intended as satires on attlee s britain the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the general election this theory was presumably not intended to apply to say kind hearts and coronets which is if anything a satire on the edwardian upper classes or to the ladykillers or the lavender hill mob both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature it can however be applied to most of the other films in the series especially passport to pimlico pimlico is or at least was in the forties a predominantly working class district of london set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station it is not quite correct to say as has often been said that the film is about pimlico declaring itself independent of britain what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy this means that technically pimlico is an independent state and has been for nearly five hundred years irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply because pimlico is not subject to british law the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please unhindered by the rationing laws when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the burgundians as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves to surrender many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system either as an individual as happens in the man in the white suit or the lavender hill mob or as part of a larger community as happens in whisky galore or the titfield thunderbolt the central theme of passport is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties the film s particular target is the rationing system during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in and organisations such as the british housewives league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film s satire were the spivs black marketeers who play a relatively minor part in the action or the housewives league who do not appear at all the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats who are portrayed either as having a rules for rules sake mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino indeed i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film in however four years after the end of the war the film makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain one of the best known lines from the film is we always were english and we always will be english and it s just because we are english that we re sticking up for our right to be burgundians there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristics most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave but in the last scene after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain global warming may have altered things slightly but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief whatever statistics might say to the contrary that britain had an abnormally wet climate the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton the grocer and small time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor in the main however this is appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film it lacks the ill will and rancour of many more recent satirical films but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and with the possible exception of kind hearts and coronets is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies 
every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state i do not think this is the point of the film at all the film parodies the spivs small time criminals who ran the blackmarket and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisation yes of course the film sends up the political social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society they want to be british and muddle through rather than foreign but i don t think they go back to being exactly like they were before 
i love this show it s sure to be a winner jessica alba does a great job it s about time we have a kick ass girl who s not the cutesy type the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots everything is layed out well and thought over to put it together must have taken a while because it wasn t someone in a hurry that just slapped something together it s a great show altogether 
gotta start with ed furlong on this one you gotta god bless this kid bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he s really like in real life he has a one liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn t even seem like furlong is even acting maybe that s why his performance was good same with madsen you keep thinking i bet this guy is really like this in real life does madsen even have to act just natural vosloo has obviously moved on from the type casted mummy guy i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro s performance her reactions are spot on in this film i battled if she was hot or not but realized i would just like to see more of her not a big fan of shoot em out hostage type films but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing it s not just your standard robbers take over a bank they kill hostages and the good guys win in the end type of film the twists keep on coming and coming the caf scenes work best with the hand held cams to show what it s really like in there not glossed over a bit think like bourne ultimatum lite style on some scenes in the caf and for those bo bice fanatics out there actor curtis wayne who plays karl will make you do a double take these guys are twins as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries states so they might have these accents but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of and some of them are smoking hot moncia dean need i say more 
this is a very funny ealing comedy about a community in central london who through an unusual set of circumstances discover they are not english but are an annex of the french province of burgundy the film features comic actor stanley holloway best known as alfred doolittle in my fair lady as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period the story was apparently based on a news item at the time when the canadian government officially gave a hotel room to a visiting european member of royalty the idea actually reminded me of the real life case of the hutt river province in western australia where a landowner seceded from the australian government due to a wool quota dispute it was never acknowledged by the western australian or australian governments this is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues rather like the tv show yes minister as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well 
this very funny british comedy shows what might happen if a section of london in this case pimlico were to declare itself independent from the rest of the uk and its laws taxes post war restrictions merry mayhem is what would happen the explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that pimlico was ceded to the duchy of burgundy centuries ago a small historical footnote long since forgotten to the new burgundians however this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please free from any interference from whitehall stanley holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world s tiniest nations dame margaret rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with pimlico others in the stand out cast include hermione baddeley paul duplis naughton wayne basil radford sir michael hordern welcome to burgundy 
i get tired of my and year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch nickelodeon disney and the like it all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again when my daughters couldn t go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while i flipped the tv on and in searching for something different i flipped the channels my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard harvey s voice i adore every single solitary thing this man has done and when i saw that he was doing voice over work for a little duck well i couldn t change the channel my daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together the more i grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed it s not necessarily a proponent for gay rights but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything i had friends who were picked on for one thing or another too fat too skinny too feminine being a bully not being smart enough only having one parent you name it kids as a rule can be very very cruel to one another so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a life message to its audience my girls already accept others as they are and don t pick on others for being different my older daughter actually stands up for her friends if they re picked on one happens to have a single mom and that little girl is picked on quite often it warms my heart when kassie stands up for her so those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that it s an advocate for gay rights or are being forced to accept certain views you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoon and if you need it explained to you well you need more help than any television show could ever offer 
henry thomas showed a restraint even when the third act turned into horrible hollywood resolution that could ve killed this movie that kept the dignity of a redemption story and as for pure creepiness sniffing babies 
this film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast david strathairn is diabolically sincere as the child molesting salesman and danny vinson plays a perfect pussy whipped southern husband the slick soundtrack betrays the murder ballad tone of the film 
i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable it is a quiet little film that doesn t overwhelm you with special effects or big performances it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods toker s search for the baby s parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life david srathairn plays truman lester a slimy conman with an ulterior motive and david plays the bad guy to perfection there is much more to this film than first meets the eye filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music it is worth watching 
henry thomas was great his character held my attention i was so into the story that i forgot it wasn t real i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself 
i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary what i love most about it is that it is understated and low key but deeply heartfelt henry thomas he played the child in e t performance is masterfully inarticulate he is supposed to be a man of few words david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain and miraculously given that we re talking about a hollywood product here a baby serves as a main character but one who doesn t act or have lines but rather just is is luminous at that interesting to note that thomas mysterious relationship w e t was the core of that film while his bond w the baby serves as the core of a good baby then there is the music ah what music gillian welch s tunes are wonderful the entire score is gorgeous hill country music this film is wonderfully atmospheric i recommend it highly 
dark angel is a cross between huxley s brave new world and percy s love in the ruins portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order both in the worst sense of the word once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by the pulse it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters max the dark angel bike messenger and logan the rich rebel it seems uneven perhaps a result of a variety of authors but is held together by the energetic beautiful and charming jessica alba who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive i think that fox has done it again 
it s cheesy it s creepy it s gross but that s what makes it so much fun it s got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable this movie is great to make fun of rent it for a good laugh the film centers around three women newscasters during a time way before cellphones they go to a small town to cover a festival but they can t get a room to stay the night and that s when they meet ernest keller he s creepy in a psycho kind of way and he offers to let them stay at his home but he doesn t tell them the truth about who lives there stephen furst s performance is so amazing as the unseen that he really carries this film most of the movie is kind of dull although finding out the truth of ernest s family is kind of interesting just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy i consider the movie an old gem hard to find and worth a look 
the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old but good acting and production make the movie worth watching the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects i rated it an out of 
all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing the first look you get of max and zach is through geneva locke and chris lazar or as i like to call them the minis the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do the main actors and actresses i e jessica alba michael weatherly etc make you forget you are watching a fictional t v show they seem to make this show come alive all in all this is the best show i have ever watched
upon the first viewing i found this tale to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie tales after many more i think it s one of the best some of the songs are pretty bad especially the love song but two things stand out that make the movie even the singing worthwhile one is the art direction like the other cannon movie tales this is a beautifully decorated period piece every piece of cloth and jewel both of which have major parts in this movie s plot look fresh and new and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants even during the love song i find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess wonderfully done the other thing is the comic timing a lot of the movie is cheesy but the emperor s vanity and his making fun of himself in the end the suspicious guard the guard chasing nicholas and the stupid prince were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose and the sequence during the song weave o makes up for the songs that weren t so good 
 hatred of a minute is a hauntingly beautiful film a psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer eric seaver strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a must see for any film student or horror fan the realness of the story and the human side of eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies some shout outs to the film s producer bruce campbell as well as to the film the evil dead add some humor for anyone that knows the genre 
michael kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as eric seaver a troubled young man who was horribly mistreated as a little boy by his monstrous abusive alcoholic stepfather barry a genuinely frightening portrayal by gunnar hansen eric has a compassionate fianc sweetly played by the lovely tracee newberry and a job transcribing autopsy reports at a local morgue haunted by his bleak past egged on by the bald beaming jack the demon a truly creepy michael robert brandon and sent over the edge by the recent death of his mother eric goes off the deep end and embarks on a brutal killing spree capably directed by kallio who also wrote the tight astute script with uniformly fine acting by a sound no name cast jeff steiger is especially good as eric s wannabe helpful guardian angel michael rather rough but overall polished cinematography by george lieber believable true to life characters jolting outbursts of raw shocking and unflinchingly ferocious violence a moody spooky score by dan kolton an uncompromisingly downbeat ending grungy detroit michigan locations a grimly serious tone and a taut gripping narrative that stays on a steady track throughout this extremely potent and gritty psychological horror thriller makes for often absorbing and disturbing viewing a real sleeper 
i thought i should qualify my position after reading other reviews the movie is not great but it has a lot of great elements the lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great the story is slow and weak but entertaining the acting is bad but no worse than you will find on the syfy channel the music is pretty good and the gore is good it has the great leather face in the film and is produced by bruce campbell i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable it was still enjoyable the women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children and up there was no sex scenes i gave it out of and i think that is fair i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do the gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film the devil is quite creepy 
 hatred of a minute is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years not to say that it s a brilliant film by any means but it s definitely worth a watch hatred chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver played by director kallio a formerly abused child now grown up and starting to listen to his evil side hatred is very nice visually the shots are creative and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at this film actually has an element of production value to it unlike other recent michigan releases like dark tomorrow and biker zombies subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film s budget however hatred stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do and that s in the story and character department essentially things just kind of happen eric seaver doesn t evolve at all basically he s always been crazy it s just that people are starting to notice the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development also the ending is very abrupt however since this is a horror film since when do we care about plot we just want to see people die and hatred certainly delivers as the body count mounted people in the theater started cheering kill her kill em all when people scream back at the screen it s always fun that s the place where hatred succeeds it s fun and in the end that s all that really matters 
this is a decent little flick made in michigan about a guy that is haunted by his past with his abusive stepfather gunnar hansen and has grown up not so well adjusted in fact he s absolutely bonkers but tries not to be too obvious he s got an entourage too his own little demon angel that follow him around the demon never says a word but really doesn t have to and he s max schreck creepy let s just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this as eric is busy doing things that make him feel better like freeing people that he decides need it mostly beautiful young women this is a decent portrayal of madness and you re kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what s going on but overall i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest it s a little lacking in some areas but nothing i can really lay my finger on a decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer flicks 
so what constitutes a real independent film in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge i m sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy which is why we should be glad that films like hatred of a minute exist across the board this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template indie horror film love it or hate it hatred isn t afraid of being what it is and in watching this film you get the real sense that kallio the director didn t just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place he s in this to tell stories good ones you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store but don t be fooled this story is also about love about good people pushed over the edge and that oh so distant light at the end of the tunnel if you expect smut or an evil dead ripoff stay away from this film but if you dig the finer points of the horror suspense genres check this film out yes bruce campbell did produce this movie and i m sure he s proud to tell anyone that it s not evil dead bruce has never tried to bank on his ash image and it s obvious that he didn t get involved with hatred so that it could do so either my advice though to all dead ites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr kallio and mr campbell are trying to show you the acting is well done although nothing about this film is oscar caliber perhaps intentionally it s good to see compassionate performances in a horror film so often actors in films such as these don t even seem to try with hatred it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously never resorting to typical horror film campiness technically hatred is about as competent as indie film gets the editing is fast paced the cinematography is good given the budget and hatred keeps a quick pace without any bog down points or bad anti climaxes all in all hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi million dollar fake indies but personally i don t see a problem with that it s a film by folks who actually care about the medium people who reached into thier broke ass pockets pulled out thier nickles and dimes threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie check this one out 
this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in it was a revelation to us we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children obviously we were wrong love may come from where you don t expect it and maybe don t want it but we both chose that love anyway and no it never changed our sexual orientation that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos when we were young we both had affairs but never with the opposite sex as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs this story is not far fetched however the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last years we are still gay end of story 
this movie is as unique as it is overlooked a different story is just that it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind i first saw this on cable in the late s and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family this film should be available on dvd vhs so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster perry king can be acknowledged but to show how far we have come still have to go where relationships are concerned 
i appreciated the photography the textures the colours and often unlike one comment the lighting what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline i found it often disjointed badly edited and at times difficult to follow my version was minutes imdb shows one at m possibly the cuts and subtitles didn t help i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine i just wanted a little more dialogue if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one try hideous kinky with kate winslet 
harem suare is the best film i saw in the year bravo ferzan ozpetek sensually shot and stunningly portrayed harem suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance which is such a taboo in hollywood women of all shapes sizes and color populate the film cut off from the outside world the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue rivalry and jealousies within their ranks 
when i think about this movie all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world texture smell color that s how i think this movie should be judged in terms of see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace or the sweltering turkish bath and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin scented oils flickering flames satin rustle don t just watch and listen be absorbed let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you 
dolph lundgren is back detention marks dolphs first film in nearly years and that is following the delayed hidden agenda this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips agent red and stormcatcher however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda which was better in almost every respect what this film does have in it s favour from dolph s previous outing is a sense of cheesy fun the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role and it s good to see dolph doing his own stunts again the films story is ludicrous and prime b movie material an ex military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching whilst taking a detention class he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy thankfully the filmmakers don t take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability this film has a so bad it s enjoyable kind of vibe where the film is let down is miss using a fairly decent budget the budget of around million has not been well spent it s all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse there are some good moments you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning with plenty of destruction the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen as for the cast hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film this however has problems the actors are on the most part bad the bad guys are terrible but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters they all hate authority each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability this movie is all about dolph though while this film is nowhere near his best it is nowhere near his worst it also marks a turning point in his career he is now back in good shape and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action dolph looks enthusiastic here he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man running from explosions in slow mo one liners and handling large weapons again in a movie like his older ones albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one it is good to see dolph looking energised his films of the last or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary and using doubles a lot he still does all the fights himself though but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode there s not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm 
this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick it isn t going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day sure the script isn t going to win any oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick but youv e seen it a million times before 
i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw it was a cool fun movie dolph looked superbly cool on the bike he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies he is now in a pretty good shape the story was ok and the other actors were also passable i wouldn t call this movie his best but its still a good movie but it also had its share of problems the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target they should ve had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers there should ve been more bad guys last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy but that was due to the small budget overall the movie was a good movie i enjoyed it i would recommend others to watch it p s now u r a dead beat cop some one liners were also cool 
there has been a political documentary of recent vintage called why we fight which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq yet a far more famous series of films with the same name was made during world war two by hollywood director frank capra although considered documentaries and having won oscars in that category this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop more in the vein of leni reifenstal s triumph of the will scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes that said that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries such as the bbc s lauded the world at war lacked nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable they are skillfully made and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase i chose goodtimes dvd s four dvd collection of the series rarely has something free been so worth invaluable while there are no extras on the dvds and the sound quality of the prints varies these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago when racism was overt as in many of the classic warner brothers pro war cartoons of the era and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts the seven films produced between and are prelude to war the nazis strike divide and conquer the battle of britain the battle of russia the battle of china and war comes to america overall the film series is well worth watching not only for the obvious reasons but for the subtle things it reveals such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars rather than the modern singular or the most overused graphic in the whole series a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria yet it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars the lesson of world war one avoid foreign entanglements was not applicable to world war two whose own lesson act early against dictatorships has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since korea vietnam nor iraq the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today s information clogged times it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today but at least you ll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position nor will you be the last 
adolf hitler s maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u s war department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii hitler s plan was methodical and well conceived starting with the conquest of eastern europe expanding to the european heartland then moving on to the world island consisting of europe asia and africa his final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the americas and the world in hitler ordered national conscription as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell grade school children sang his praises and young german boys received training and indoctrination in military camps marching unopposed into austria in hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland in hitler took all of czechoslovakia later in the year the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non aggression pact with it s mortal enemy russia a ploy to delay hitler s military involvement on too many fronts immediately after germany invaded poland bringing hitler s conquest right to russia s doorstep he would deal with her later it was during this period that britain still declined to oppose hitler s thrust across europe prime minister neville chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with germany his infamous declaration stating peace in our time it didn t turn out that way the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment at least to me was provided by a small snippet of footage from a german pro hitler rally in the mid s it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the homeland the venue madison square garden 
this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler s rise every school child nay every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos history has been repeating itself over and over again the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups are still working to these evil group s advantage by sitting back and letting hitler as early as be aggressive france america and england caused over million people s deaths americans french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs they don t tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them fighting hitler this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war 
i can t understand what it is that fans of the genre didn t like about this film it was truly a lot of fun the special effects were wonderful i generally agree with reviews and with imdb voters but not this time i waited until it came to home video which i felt was another reason that i wouldn t enjoy the film i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen but again this was not the case to me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time blair witch and the mummy both films that i thought were terrible blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time the mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck people liked it for it s special effects films like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development they are more like funhouse rides well with that analogy the mummy was a b ticket to the haunting s e ticket 
what can i say that hasn t been said about the haunting it has everything that would make a great picture wonderful sets moody music and sound design to die for were all in place the screenplay though sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird surrealistic way the entire team must have forgotten to read it through maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was each member of the cast gives a worthy performance although with little conviction to the material at hand lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her but that s about it all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours but you will definitely want more a lot more 
i just got puzzled why damn fox canceled the season although season was not as good as season which is excellent indeed i like it so much that i even thinking about buying dvd on amazon failed _ i am a chinese student and it s inconvenient for me to get a international credit card and i just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow 
i don t know why the critics trashed this movie i hardly ever agree with them anyway the movie could have been a little scarier i don t usually go to horror movies i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime i needn t have bothered the cinema was full of kids too heh liam was great as always i also liked catharine zeta jones theo and lili taylor eleanor nell the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way the special and sound effects were awesome i also loved the music score particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power peace and freedom 
i know it is fashionable now to hate this movie i have seen hundreds of spook films including he original haunting as well as most of the hammer films this film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it yet many viewers can accept out of control films like scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great i have seen it times now and it gets better every time the director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the th sense the haunting lets go and is certainly not boring perhaps this film might appeal more to john carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure the old haunting was also a fine film from it was even more scary see both and also the innocents and the legend of hell house with pamela franklin 
the haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house good effects work and sound work a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house there are scenes that make you jump and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past i found interesting there are genuinely creepy moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets curtains and the house itself jerry goldsmith s score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you what i wish could ve happened is for something a little more intense jan de bont had a pg rating to contend with and i think that he held back a little too much poltergeist scared me silly when i saw it many years ago and it still holds up the haunting could ve used a few more scenes of pure terror the ending was for me a little anticlimactic overall i enjoyed it the acting is good and there are moments that make you jump i just wish it scared me more 
it seems to be a perfect day for swimming a normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this whereas the tide is rising the woman barbara stanwyck takes the car and searches for help john sturges short movie minutes is powerful because of unanswered questions stanwyck finds a guy who could help but there is a price she has to pay for this there is a double question the movie poses how far would you go to help the man that you love and on the other hand observing stanwyck s behaviors towards the stranger does she really love her husband like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself 
jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budget box office ones it s a mere minutes and doesn t feature many sets and the only star is barbara stanwyck but what a star of course stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help some psychological battling there it s a surprisingly effective little movie its short length makes it taut and that stanwyck is great should go without mention but i ll still praise her every time 
the only time i have seen this movie was when i was years old i have remembered it all of these years as i couldn t sleep for a week or more after seeing it it just absolutely rattled me i was on vacation with my aunts in ft worth texas and i will never forget it now years later my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it i very much enjoyed it but it gave me quite a scare jaqui
dark angel is a futuristic sci fi series set in post apocalyptic seattle centering on max jessica alba a genetically enhanced young woman on the run from her creators the dark angel universe is absorbing not as much as say buffy but absorbing nonetheless with an interesting and believable set of characters certainly it is not for everyone but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there dark angel is criminally overlooked and under rated and was unfortunatly canceled after only series which was a great shame as this had the potential to become a great series although its episodes are only shy of long running bbc sci fi comedy red dwarf as it is dark angel remains unfinished so seek it out and if you want more lobby fox to make another series 
i found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get go when miss stanwyck starts her narration it s only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming the deserted area the lock on the deserted gas station door everything sets you up to wait for it here it comes at first you think it will be about the little boy but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in i found this movie to be really stressful even though i had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating maybe a white knuckles award 
leonard maltin must ve been watching some other movie though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource please disregard his comments on this one he states starts off well then fizzles when it s really the reverse starts off tepid then catches fire the plot is about as simple as it gets happy mom happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach dad incapacitated in accident mom runs off to get help meets up with dangerous escaped convict mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear life good white knuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker appearing suddenly the director john sturges films it in a clever way that will make you gasp around halfway through as the cunning desperate criminal meeker is an unusually flippant reckless actor at least here and in the classic kiss me deadly and he happily snatches the keys to the film s narrative and speeds off with the top down his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying pretty neat huh when he s especially pleased with his misdeeds there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage barbara stanwyck don t go away she fires back where would i go they re in the middle of nowhere and he realizes sitcom ishly yeah that s right the friction between them is a hoot there are flaws somewhat ridiculous ones there s one scene where the police who have been chasing after meeker for some time stop stanwyck s car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would and pretends to be asleep as she s being questioned a he looks conspicuously un masculine in this pose and b i think it s safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion 
does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film i love it one of my top films of all time it just makes me feel good i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over bebe benson michelle johnston is the babe of the film imho i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film the two are like apples and oranges the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work i believe it s only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren t changed more than they are this is a very good film it is very satisfying that s all you need to know 
as many reviewers here have noted the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story i have never seen the stage version of the story and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer michael douglas show the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try out group this way our attention is focused on the dancers movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try outs douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one and the backstage clich ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added i have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film the repeated intrusions cassie made during try outs appear to mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and or luck however this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past and it s curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the i can do that number but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories frankly their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this of stars 
this movie will always be a broadway and movie classic as long as there are still people who sing dance and act 
this show is so full of action and everything needed to make an awsome show but best of all it actually has a plot unlike some of those new reality shows it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base i totally suggest bying the dvds i ve already preordered them i suggest you do to 
anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly i would refer them to roger ebert s review of this movie he is one of the most respected critics in the industry and he gave it stars this is a great movie it may not be perfect or spectacular but i enjoyed it a chorus line is not so much a story as it is a group of stories about the lives of broadway hopefuls i read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between zach and cassie that is an incorrect view it is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the broadway hopefuls what people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through and that i think is really the point of the whole show it is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancers but to give us some poignant things to think about in regard to life in general this is a study of life as a broadway star anyone who has dreamed of becoming a broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through this is a great musical it has its slow points and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed it take a closer look at the movie and then maybe you will understand what i am talking about 
hi for all the people who have seen this wonderful movie im sure thet you would have liked it as much as i i love the songs once you have seen the show you can sing along as though you are part of the show singing and dancing dancing and singing the song one is an all time fave musical song too and the strutters at the end with the mirror its so oh you have to watch this one
i ve long wanted to see this film being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum i agree that the romantic sub plot was a waste of time but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war especially with the way things were throughout the s some of the boys are a bit scary i certainly wouldn t want to met them on a well lit street much less a dark one there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well or as they call him a firefly 
man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word the comedy concerns a character called robin tripp played by the great richard o sullivan who finds himself after a wild party ending up at the home of two ladies called jo and chrissy ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate the obvious ends up happening as he moves in man about the house was a pre cursor to cooke and mortimer s spin off show george and mildred which featured the characters who were landlords to jo chrissy and robin these two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with mildred the late and much missed yootha joyce in particular getting some of the best lines of the series a semi regular character was larry doug fisher a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something and never to return it the american s did a version called three s company but it doesn t stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script what a pity modern comedy can t reach that high standard this programme is available on network dvd
like a lot of series pilots dark angel s opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet not that this is unusual in any way but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more in today s world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused with all guns blazing the ninety minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together and both episodes have a problem with focus in the first half we are introduced to max and filled in on what drives her we also get a few interesting routines with max using her abilities to win bets interacting with a pi or sorting out co workers domestic problems the problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes on television or otherwise it s when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus throughout the two halves max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time in the second half the repercussions catch up with him and max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess this sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series and it works but it doesn t quite click if you get my meaning it s like most of the pieces are there but a couple that make a complete image have been left out perhaps they get filled in with later episodes but that s beside the point the fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twenty eight less minutes the last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing original cindy in particular is an annoyance and i doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes while the acting isn t as bad as daytime soap it isn t of such quality that i d commend it jessica alba is not the worst actor in the world but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least the good news is that the premise and the production values are all top notch in fact this series was considered quite expensive to produce and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didn t last a whole season especially when there was ample time for both shows they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality tv the fact is that we need more shows like dark angel where imagination rather than overhype are used to draw the attention in all i gave the dark angel pilot a seven out of ten it never rises above the level of throwaway television and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time but the potential is there and that s often all that matters where pilots are concerned 
as is nearly always the case when britain comes up with an entertaining and or successful sit com or quiz show the yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own grossly inferior version man about the house is of course no exception to that rule the yanks version three s company was unwatchable braindead pap that seem to run forever a prime example of quantity over non existent quality the original on the other hand is a fondly remembered gem that had the savvy like fawlty towers to pull the plug at precisely the right time unlike the episodes of hilarity that three s company came up with jo was cute there was brilliant chemistry between the ropers richard o sullivan made it all look so easy the scripts whilst not exactly oscar wilde standard were consistently funny and chrissy was the most drop dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since the dead sea was merely feeling unwell nuff said 
in watching this early demille work it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable his pacing is very good enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so it is a pity that he wasn t as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films this was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely she was remarkable quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions the ending is wonderful 
this film has a clear storyline which is quite unusual to the musical genre cats phantom of the opera and other andrew lloyd webber s musicals can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as their framework biarkan bintang menari bbm s storyline touches the very core of human relationships especially that of indonesian people despite the fact the film was based on a supposedly fairytale it s actually a fantasy of the child in indonesian adults the dance sequences are not perfect yet the songs represent how indonesians express themselves i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing by not dismaying the fact that indonesia s dance development tends to be more westernized the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and or music yet i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre which i hope to improve in the future 
i think dark angel is great first season was excellent and had a good plot with max jessica alba as an escaped x manticore creation trying to adapt to a normal life but still saving the world and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first the plot kinda disappeared and the series lost a little of it s charm mostly because of all the weird creatures appearing don t get me wrong the second season is good but with a little bit to much of the manticores however they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season in which i had a lot of hopes to see more of so i really wish they could start making new episodes and with james cameron behind this it can t go wrong so as a conclusion i would say it s a great series however i m still hoping for a third season 
i caught this on the dish last night i liked the movie i traveled to russia different times adopting our kids i can t put my finger on exactly why i liked this movie other than seeing bad turn good and good turn semi bad i liked the look ben chaplin has through the whole movie like i can t belive this is happening to me whether it s good or bad it the same look and it works great ending rent it or catch it on the dish like i did 
this is a great little film that s very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances all the characters are great and the story while bizarre is fascinating and very interesting plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this it s very hard to describe this movie because it really is quite bizarre it s a comedy romance one minute then it turns into a thriller the next however it was still very entertaining all the same plus nicole s russian accent was fantastic and extremely convincing chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together and i loved vincent cassel s performance plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise the ending was very cute and it s unpredictable throughout plus this movie is quite underrated as well you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is scammed and i thought all the characters were really likable plus the finale is especially good this is nicole s movie though and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance this is a great little film that s very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances i highly recommend this one the direction is very good jez butterworth does a very good job here with great camera work solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace the acting is wonderful nicole kidman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always she is incredibly sexy very likable had one of the coolest accents added a lot of presence had very good chemistry with ben chaplin and had a very mysterious character she was amazing kidman rules ben chaplin is great here he is extremely likable had a cool character had very good chemistry with kidman the only thing i didn t like was him taking out his anger out on kidman even though what she did was wrong and i loved how he got revenge in the end vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain yes he was ott but he was very intense and quite creepy at times this role was perfect for him mathieu kassovitz is ok here but didn t have much to do rest of the cast are fine overall i highly recommend this one out of 
every time i see nicole i like her more i love a movie like this a woman you just won t give up on but she keeps breaking your heart first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage the kim novak laurence harvey version the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can t speak russian i m sure funny how people miss the point the no goodnik russian guys were well cast too finally i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin as somebody else noted he plays a sap with great dignity and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole to think guys get paid for that mind blowing 
modern original romantic story very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent ben chaplin is also good as the shy dull clerk for the men and some women miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is it s not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense although i hoped for a happy ending the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me conclusion good movie les pays bas huit points 
when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it i theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control with nicole kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment imho thus for instance dogville even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else s attention or other pet causes of kidman s here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job i don t how or who was able to restrain her but apparently it worked the way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman and consequently what makes a man s most desperate hopes marginally attainable of course the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy but his transformation is adequately believable it isn t coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human apart from their criminal mission her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to american culture and while they are his adversaries they are never really his enemy in effect they teach him to be compete i really marveled at kidman s ability to physically appear russian it had me wondering whether her ancestry was russian but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film despite my gratuitous digs at ms kidman the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime 
the first von trier movie i ve ever seen was breaking the waves sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa europa tells a story of a young german american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train because of his job he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany meeting with the killing of traitors and hunt for former nazi party members the society is suffering from corruption his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called werewolves they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains the atmosphere is astounding the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene just when you think you ve seen a lot europe 
this is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching the story is engaging and it doesn t take long before the chemistry between nicole kidman and ben chaplin grabs your attention the acting is first class and the characters are represented well sometimes it feels like the director couldn t decide himself between drama and romantic comedy ben chiller s portrayal of the law abiding and shy englishman with porn s m magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs as does the look in nicole kidman s eyes when she is offering john his first taste of intimacy in a long time other times the actors and especially nicole kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant 
for a film that got little publicity and few people have heard about this was pretty good it s another one of these modern day british crime films that are quirky snatch sexy beast etc it s not wild like snatch but it s interesting and it has some rough characters it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show not late has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first time viewer basically it s about a low key british male who sends away for a russian mail order bride who winds up with the aid of two russian male friends providing a couple of big surprises ben chapin and nicole kidman co star and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman s russian cohorts this is a different kind of film and well acted kidman once again proves she s far more than just a beautiful face 
this movie really woke me up like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber this guy john ben chaplin leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town until the stunningly gorgeous wild girl to die for nadia nicole kidman ordered by email from russia enters his life to become his beloved wife by johns plan however a glitch turns up nadia does not speak a word of johns language although calm and emotionless on the outside john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently paid safe feeling clerk into a decision making decently thinking action figure giving the viewer a subliminal message you would have probably acted likewise kidman cassel kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing almost only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles at least from the cultural background the pace of the film is fast and captivating and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear you rather feel that you re in the middle of the plot and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy to sum it up it has an unusual plot great acting and ideas below the surface like the idea of the rude awakening from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society s machine the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings welcome to the machine i bet that in the end john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all thank you writers for the great story and everyone else for this great movie please make a sequel and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the percent of the potential viewers i am sure of it 
jessica alba s max and valerie rae miller s original cindy shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial wonderfully politically incorrect quality varies greatly from episode to episode but generally the standard is high and when it is not jessica is always worth looking at valerie s urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging dark angel into sitcom territory 
teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite good too i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing though i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show i might be wrong but as far as i am aware the show was conceptualized in and appeared on global tv in canada in early it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well too bad this couldn t be paired up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on ctv but the two shows would be great companion pieces 
i m watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own there s lucy bewitched i dream of jeanie the one with barbara feldman and then my mind goes kind of blank i cannot think of any others the women are all supporting roles not the lead so for me the jane show is in pretty good company one thing i just thought of though i ve watched several things made in canada and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow it s all made at the height of summer lol granted it s a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since that s part of the lifestyle there also i mean sctv just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor and i like the bald guy and his craziness i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd i think another office comedy with a female lead not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone thats saying something if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch of 
spacecamp is my favorite movie it is a great story and also inspires others the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie the th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school i also know a close friend of the late pilot i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers invisible going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result so i m much closer to the accident and any movie similarities i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later strangely enough on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in and who later built endeavour 
spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love and mom and dad can have fun watching as well growing up in the s i enjoyed this movie it s plot and all the actors i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did the plot is fun a group of kids embark on a journey they never expected when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot they were in auh at first but when they realized they didn t have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life 
i ve been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too some of the users are stuck in a realist type of mentality this film was meant to be a fantasy a what if fun film it was never meant to be real or serious it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion i was at the time and totally enjoyed this one my young son loved it too later i shared it with my daughter and she too loved it spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that fun all the realists in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt letdown i guess their parents didn t explain the difference between fantasy and reality oh well if you love fantasy fun films and haven t seen this one i highly recommend it enjoy 
space camp is a pretty decent film the plot is predictable but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent for the time this film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster and that really put a hamper on how popular it was the scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular on the big screen that is on a tv it just looks average i remember this scene in the theater it made you feel like you were really up there this would be a good film to see on imax but i m sure that will never happen 
to my surprise i quite enjoyed spacecamp i remember seeing it about years ago and recently i hired it again i was quite impressed obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp however this film had a story a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it but thats what i liked about it they don t make films like this anymore so it was a refreshing change it was interesting to see kelly preston leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light fluffy plot absolutely loved the robot named jinx it was very cute but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters the film was almost inspirational in its own way and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama i think 
this is a family film which to some people is an automatic turn off it seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the new york phone book this film is none of those it is clich it is formula but it is also fun it doesn t ask you to think it doesn t demand that you accept the film as reality it simply does what a good film ought to do which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure the cast is good while not excellent as another commenter pointed out the john williams sound score was as usual excellent and the fact that a lot of the film was shot in huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable it was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the challenger shuttle disaster which may have played a large part in it s original theatrical opening but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein so sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy 
the perfect space fantasy film a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down but do they sure they do this would not be a family film if they all died then it will all be sad you don t want that kate capsaw the leading lady gives a golden globe performance but sadly she nor lea thompson won one that sucks so bad i can t say it enough this film is so great lea thompson o lord a perfect girl for this film this film is the best for sure sorry but better than star wars star wars is so over rated and space camp was so under rated it should of been the other way around excellent r maybe iam not good at math
a few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot and the oxygen in ship was running short they had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks etc etc first of all this movie s plot is not possible in real life but it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in it is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years i saw this movie for the first time in the year of it was filmed in there are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in hollywood the view was great from outer space it does not look unreal it is about hours long it runs so fast that you won t even notice you know that it is not real but you just get sucked into it until the end overall it is a good family movie 
unfortunately spacecamp came out about the same time as the challenger explosion which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should bring it out i m glad they did i first watched spacecamp at a drive in movie which really enhanced the viewing a lot while i had heard of lea thompson and tom skerritt i had never heard of the others in the movie so it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting and acting real good of course kate capshaw was excellent too i especially liked the scenes where those kids were being shown how to act as a team the scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for the actual launch of a spacecraft is of course old news to us however this one was different all in all this is one of my most treasured films escapist maybe but it was fantastic for a space nut like me after probably renting it for times i finally found it available in a certain store and bought it now if it only comes out on dvd i will probably have it forever this movie gets a out of from me 
i notice the dvd version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the frf and the launch they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the frf other than the green team another scene is like during their failure at the simulation kevin gets joaquin to clam down i think the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuff otherwise i like to know which dvd release has the missing stuff the dvd i have watched feels edited for television 
i could see this film is super he didn t surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn t have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory right very i liked watching this film when i was the child i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense who at healthy senses sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit i very like reading for the subject american and soviet space programs i know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by cia with the clause top secret certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows 
wow this film is the best living testament i think of what happened on in nyc compared to anything shown by the major media outlets those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside this film shows you what happened on the inside it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers you are then given a front row seat as firefighters rush to the scene into the lobby of tower one in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane and tower two s subsequent fall you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby it is a sight you will not soon forget heart rending tear jerking and very compelling from the first minute to the last deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made we must never forget 
when this first came out months after the tragedy i didn t want to see it i didn t want to open old wounds i regretted it now i have seen the movie thank god i did it shows you the bravery of all the fdny and nypd i salute you it offered me closure i can now move on with my life 
if i didn t know any better it almost seems like it was staged but it wasn t it was set up perfectly and how they got all of that footage is amazing the unfortunate events of september are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic just the history in the footage alone should make it a must see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of september 
it took us a couple of episodes to get into dark angel as a story and a series since we were transitioning from the sopranos a very different mentality framework but once we got with the gist of the series we were very quickly hooked it s a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category dark angelwas much more than your average tv series it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to mutants reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face and make everyday that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti discrimination message from being rubbed in our faces hence not ruining the fun for those who don t like to be lectured during entertainment but every event and human societal interaction remains relevant to the present we all make judgments face our own prejudices but in the end the question of who you are lies in do you sit back and shut your mind to it or do you get up and do something about it for those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice this series empowers them for those who ve never had to face the question this series sneaks in that message under the guise of pure action entertainment it is much more well made and well written than most tv series i m highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear 
made by french brothers jules and giddeon naudet and narrated by robert de niro and firefighter james hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how new york s finest shone on it s darkest day i first saw this when i was a young naive year old and at that age it still touched me knowing how serious really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of we were finding out who the heroes were how there everyday lives were composed and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves these brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them watch if you can this is the best documentary i have personally ever seen 
let me get the bad out of the way first james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september th it is a second home to me and i can t help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city this is the real deal in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day it is a shame that they didn t use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way 
dark angel rocks the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off me and my friends have gatherings to watch every da episode takes like days but it is worth it it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me 
incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september th intense personal and completely riveting is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident which kind of gives it an even greater appeal up until that morning filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center and from there a simple documentary was no more viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero as the amazing group of fire fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster without hesitation naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it s entire support crumbles around them the raw fear of an unknown impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside nearly as memorable is older brother gideon s candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed by the time we get to see the second tower collapse as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up close footage captured obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage even if it cost them their own safety after viewing and seeing that it came out in i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone s recent rendition the big budgeted world trade center many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought all but renders his film completely obsolete not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again 
great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item what shocked me was not only the attacks but the high fat diet and physical appearance of some of these firefighters i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that in the physical shape they were in some of these firefighters would not of made it to the th floor carrying over lbs of gear having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job the french have a history of making great documentary s and that is what this is a great documentary 
very interesting and moving documentary about the world trade center tragedy on th september the main theme of it is the heroism of american fire fighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could the film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing many people seen on screen have lost their lives recommended 
 is a classic example of cinema verite a sort of realist documentary in this case of new york firemen as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history it s all tiny unobtrusive hand held video cameras often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming and by the director naudet s hand frequently wiping the screen in this film you get to know most of the firemen tony benatatos the rookie or probie in ny fireman vernacular the fire chief joseph pfeiffer who finds he s lost his brother later on and a few others there are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film just to emphasise the personal reflexive nature of the events the build up is quite dramatic and well done particularly the passing out ceremony at the fire department with a few useful swish pans and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited filmwork just like rob reiner s a few good men tony looks proud the viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the firemen which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the lobby of wtc while pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next this is classic cinema verite there is also the eery haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside it is then that an increasingly forlorn fire chief pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless and this is before wtc collapses you have to give credit to naudet for knowing which faces to film and at which moment the sound of the neighbouring wtc collapsing is so awfully sad poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the firemen from the lobby it looks feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened you hear an enormous rumbling trembling maelstrom like that of a giant monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded the neighbouring tower has collapsed yet the fire team remaining in wtc are oblivious to this event where is the communication this film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided cues like this really was a day like no other or naudet s frequently banal pronouncements like you could see fear in everybody s eyes and i knew tony was freaking out the film is really just one long video diary there are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firemen have gone imagine this film blended with cctv footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day the effect would be greater you could even combine this story with that of mayor giuliani and perhaps the famous cornishman rick riscorla who literally was many floors up acting the hero i don t see much of a propaganda element in this film as some reviewers suggest this film is no triumph of the will by riefenstahl some time later the firemen drape the american flag over a nearby surviving building overlooking what has become ground zero so what there are also some moments of dubious camerawork for example who is holding the camera when the two naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station is it staged there is an excellent finish very much in the traditon of the excellent french director alain resnais hiroshima mon amour with two strips of light reflected in the water shimmying 
my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her she s from china and only heard so much about and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary i felt awful watching this documentary it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes but i m extremely grateful that i watched this documentary because on the day of september th i m sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard all of us could only think certain questions why how what s going on oh my god almost all the americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others but i don t think we thought about what they were really going though this wasn t actually supposed to be a documentary about the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the world trade centers and got everything outside and in on tape on sep th i thought to myself it s ok the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived to be honest i thought it was an accident i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class someone came into the locker room shouting some building just got bombed in new york we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on tv not only seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident a few minutes later we heard about the pentagon and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking what are the firemen and policemen going to do but it s procedure to them i thought they ll know what to do the first tower collapsed we knew it so many lives are now gone the second tower crashed things would never be the same those firemen in this documentary showed courage confusion and strength the real raw human emotions they didn t know what to do they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers they heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows and here i was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on tv i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help i know they feel like they were just doing their job but they did more they were hero s every day after sep th for weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors but they kept on hoping and praying may god bless their kind and brave hearts as for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day she asked why i didn t know what to say it breaks my heart that people can be that evil it sounds clique but it was a normal day for everyone one of the firemen said in the documentary no one expected this to happen not like that those people in the world trade centers or the pentagon or the planes that were hijacked they were just doing their job happen to be there or even just was there for a second passing by they were not just murdered they were slaughtered and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating why do people do this they celebrated death and the lose of mothers fathers sisters brothers friends grandparents aunts uncles cousins etc why so thanks to those people for making this documentary you truly think about the firemen policemen and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world thank you to all those people you are our heroes 
i must admit that i was very sceptical about this documentary i was expecting it to be the kind of all american propaganda that we here in europe dislike so much i was wrong this is not propaganda in fact it is hardly political at all it depicts the events of through the eyes of the firefighters called to the scene just after the planes crashed it is an amazing coinsidence that this documentary was filmed at all this film was initially shot as a documnetary about a rookie ny firefighter becoming a man we can only thank the film makers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced them a great piece of work absolutely stunning material highly recommended regards 
yowsa if you really want some action check out the babes and bombs on this non stop thriller veteran star martin sheen leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism but director dean hamilton doesn t let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of teensy swimsuit scenes jiggly beach jogs hubba hubba hot tubs and the like want action you ll get more of it here than in pearl harbor want babes you ll get an eyeful every two minutes want more go out and buy this video yowsa yowsa yowsa that s some mighty spicy meatballs 
a thin story with many fine shots eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the d r e a m team and to a lesser extent the guy accompanying them traci lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business couple intending to poison the world with antrax original in this movie is the bra bomb put on a captured member of the d r e a m team of course she is rescued by a co member three seconds before explosion although clearly lent from james bond s goldfinger and you only live twice such a climax always works well all in all a nice watch james bond replaced here by three charlie s angels 
i love monte carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie i thought everyone was very good i was not familiar with richard lewis i thought he made his character julian peters very personable funny and attractive sean young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold george hamilton was charming and the perfect italian gigolo john candy has a field day as the bon vivant james belushi is hysterical as a total jerk cybill shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife delightful ensemble cast lots of talent clever script lots going on and beautiful locations just a nice pick me up for a dreary day especially in the winter when a trip to europe is not anywhere on your horizon 
super slick entertainment with a stellar cast an outstanding script and a firm grip on the approaching s at the time rko was turning out classic noirs by the dozens but whatever the value of those shadowy downers they reflected a war time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the eisenhower era few films of the late s are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy jim blandings cary grant works as an ad man on madison ave where in his little daughter s words he sells things to people that they don t need at prices they can t afford he s making good money but like thousands of others he s tired of living in a cramped urban cave so with wife myrnah loy they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the connecticutt countryside needless to say in the arms of nature they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion there s hardly a lifeless line in the entire script i don t know if writers panama and frank got an oscar but they should have of course the humor revolves around all the problems that pop up when city people build a big house on rural land the annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time of course no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than grant so it s just one well placed laugh after another particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own yet oddly the film appears to have no comedic high point instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don t peak at any particular point that s a real movie triumph for any era reaching back years later we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind with their live in maid the blandings may not be a typical american family but that post war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical and what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than blandings as an ad man tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ham more than anything however there s the movie s sunny optimism oh sure the feeling falters at times yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through indeed life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge so i expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day it s that easily over looked subtext along with the sheer entertainment value that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post war period so if you haven t seen it catch it next time around 
with a well thought out cast this movie was a great comedic relief the plot is well written and the cast was knockout every bit as good as the reviews suggested a rarity and was highly entertaining being a huge john candy fan myself this movie was no disappointment 
 about the importance of being young having friends and most of all enjoying life through the experience of four friends ligabue shows to the audience how life was back in the s in a small italian village the four carachters represent the four different aspects of human behavior also the drug experience is well represented 
 radiofreccia is still a good surprise in italian cinema the film is based on a book of italian songwriter luciano ligabue who also directs the movie and writes the music score of course the film is a portrait of north italian province life in the emilia romagna region we re in the time of the first free radios one of the boys of the movie creates radioraptus youth wishes friendship love sex individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes but the film speaks also about drugs freccia the main character is a victim of heroin slavery without being boring and moralist the story flows very well the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well obviously luciano liga ligabue is neither fellini nor a movie professional first of all he s a musician but he succeeds in making a good product unfortunately he ll not repeat the success with his second movie da zero a dieci not good at all in radiofreccia actors are generally not very famous the only star is stefano accorsi one of the most popular young italian actors see in a small role another italian songwriter francesco guccini he s the nice communist barman and football trainer 
now this show looks like most of the other shows of it s type from the mid s but the only thing is about this one is that it s different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i can t understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since up to date my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesn t hurt to dream doesn t it anyway i would recommend if you hadn t seen it to find the dvd of all episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great 
a classic cartoon always enjoyable and funny it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters road rovers is a show worth seeing it is a short episodes and if you can ever manage a chance to see it you should unfortunately it is very hard to find i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all episodes i would definitely buy it if they did and if they do you should buy it too if you have kids who like dogs they will love road rovers road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was 
this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes the money pit and are we done yet only points out all the more how the s movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since regretfully been lost i was when i first saw this and even at that tender age there was much i could laugh at now of course being familiar with adult frustrations i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth the three main actors cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas interacted perfectly but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream it s never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions all in all this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it 
far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did after animaniacs even if the ratings were low so what i still enjoyed it and loved it was so funny and i adored the cast wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic the whole cast were brilliant especially the legendary frank welker i d love to see this cartoon again was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental that was just fantastic i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back i loved them
though not in the whole film andy griffith again plays his role best in this cbs tv movie the plot is easy griffith s character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named mountains somewhere though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video if you do get the chance to watch this take it 
i saw that when i was little and it was excellent kelsey white as lisa and the meecy mices where cute susan bonde as doodle and sandra dee heidecke as snoodle where hilarius karen boettcher tate as profster was interesting burl ross as little bunny foo foo was funny gregory donavon as kaiso was brilliant whats hilarius that snoodle and doodle eat too much candy whats sad that little bunny foo foo that bops the meecy mices on the head then by a fairy will give little bunny foo foo few wishes then he turns into goon this story is about when lisa snoodle doodle go to the big rock candy mountains this show is excellent the kids will like this show new words songs and watching them playing 
so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it we would watch it all the time when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we d watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa s magical toys i m now and i still love this movie some old friends and i recently got together and watched it we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated profster when we were little one friend actually bought this movie and grandpa s magical toys for her year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe no violence no bad language just lots of great songs and important lessons 
big rock candy mountain is amazing i watched it when i was little and still do to this day senior in high school if i could imagine heaven that is what it would look like i wish i could live in big rock candy mountain where candy grows on trees zach hyman is profs and my best friend little bunny foo foo is the man it is so fuzzy and colorful that i dream about it at night in fact my friend who is recently watched it for the first time and absolutely loved it i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie i am having a huge party this weekend with all my friends to watch this incredible movie we are going to order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle i constantly find myself watching clouds and wishing i was that little girl that got to visit thanks bye 
when i was little my parents got this movie for me to watch i really liked it and i watched it over and over again even when i was in rd grade i still watched it from time to time recently i watched it again just for the sake of nostalgia and though the show was not aimed for my age group i m in my late teens i still found it entertaining and educational this show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others some parts i found quite entertaining also this show does not have any bad content so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot i would recommend this 
good show very entertaining good marshal arts acting good story plot the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich to chuck norris jennifer tung and especially a big hand to judson mills an especially fine tribute to robert urich in his latter days a great actor who will be truly missed 
if you re a a fan of either or both chuck norris judson mills then this is the movie to see it has a lot of adventure in it it is a great follow up to president s man the chemistry between the main three stars chuck norris judson mills jennifer tung is incredible my personal opinion this movie along with the original has turned out so well that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series if you ve seen president s man i recommend this movie for you if you ve seen president s man a line in the sand but you haven t seen president s man then let me suggest that you do you will not be disappointed with either one 
composed elegant carol marvelously played by the beautiful rebecca brooke her nice husband eddie likable david houseman carol s wacky constantly eating best gal pal anna delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable chris jordan and anna s hunky amorous husband pete a typically fine eric edwards are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other their usual routine gets disrupted when carol s lonely repressed but still alluring widow mother jennifer a superbly moving performance by the lovely jennifer welles drops by for a visit pretty soon jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle with everyone except carol eager to seduce her writer director joe sarno concocts a sharp engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild n easy s sexual revolution sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother daughter incest subplot moreover sarno elicits uniformly first rate acting from the bang up cast welles and brooke are both exceptional with excellent support from edwards jordan houseman arlana blue as flaky new age sex therapist shandara and erica eaton as saucy neighbor mrs fields better still all the women are extremely hot and enticing welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence the sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit but never raunchy or tedious stephen colwell s bright polished cinematography and jack justis bouncy melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective recommended viewing for sarno fans 
though not seen in too many films prior you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since not one of grant s nor loy s best films they make an outstanding effort together after all with that much talent and very good supporting cast you know the laughs will be there the film is light has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through a great example of classic american film fare that has stood the test of time definite saturday afternoon fare heavy on the popcorn 
this movie is far better than the original the jerk i would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor we have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from monty python the card game with the hobos and then with mr suicide the scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup the original the jerk was too choreographed ans staged while i like steve martin he seemed like he was trying to hard the jerk too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone the jerk too is family friendly unlike the original the jerk 
honestly when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off as i sat there for the next minutes or so i realized that the actor playing navin stole the show his facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to why he hasn t been in more comedies he has this marty feldman thing going for him but much much more talent taking nothing away from marty the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk but then again it was so much more i really think that if this movie was released first and i saw the steve martin movie nd i d think the nd was a cheap rip off i know it sounds like a bold statement but it s true i actually like steve martin a great deal but his performance is nd to the actor in the jerk too i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection i urge you to see it if you can find it 
stuck in a hotel in kuwait i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning first pachelbel s canon brought a lump to my throat then the sight of a tiger moth which my grandfather my father and i have all flown produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then crowe s name hooked me completely i was entranced by this film crowe s performance again the subject matter and yes what a debt we owe how various matters were addressed and dealt with the flying sequences my father flew avro ansons too the story and as another contributor pointed out crowe s recitation of high flight i won t spoil the film for anyone but separated from my wife by odd miles as an ex army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot i admit to crying heartily a couple of times buy it rent it download it beg borrow or steal it but watch it ps did i spy a bristol blenheim in yellow training colours on the ground looked like a twin engine aircraft with a twin brownings in a dorsal turret 
i enjoyed every moment of this movie even though i knew they could never really be together with the life expectancy of a bomber pilot being only six weeks it made me feel for all of those women and men back in the s who must have lived this story 
movie comedies nowadays are generally minutes of toilet humor foul language and groin kicking modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator the undemanding and slow of brain sure an occasional good comedy will come along but they re becoming rarer all the time mr blandings buildings his dream house shows what s hollywood was capable of and it s just screamingly funny jim and muriel blandings cary grant and myrna loy decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs the film follows their story beginning with house hunting trips the house s riotous construction all the way to the finished home with its zuzz zuzz water softener grant and loy are perfect for their roles of course grant is particularly funny as he watches the house s costs zoom out of control however the film is stolen by the blandings wise attorney played to perfection by melvyn douglas managing to steal every scene he s in douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis reginald denny as the blandings harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful i ve watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh i think it s a good film to watch when you need a lift whether you re building a house or not 
very nicely done movie it does stay in your memory better billed as a romance than flying or war altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love fun watching early crowe he is good and exudes charm his reading of high flight is superb cheers boom
japanese tomo akiyama s keko mask is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch there are also some sequels but i haven t seen them since these films are hyper rare some kind of re releases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline which is according to the teachers the most important thing in education the school is lead by incredibly funny looking just look at the costume human wizard whatever who is like principal in the school and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed well the main thing about the film is its name keko mask who is some beautiful and masked fairy who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers yes this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background the most important thing is of course that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked her identity is never revealed in these films and also the credits say keko mask unknown while the actor names are listed the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies she has a gorgeous but lethal vagina yes you read right she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like i ve never seen such a beautiful vagina and now i can die in peace this film is totally fantastic there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films japanese censors optically fog blur all the pubic hair in any film and also about some restrictions among school students like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc there s one great scene in which one nerd sees girl s bare you know what for the first time and says hey there s no fog in it i couldn t help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this also one character says in the end that he will return if japan films allows to make the sequel i m glad it allowed as i ve heard the sequels are equally outrageous one sequel should include blues brothers yes those blues brothers in it etc this is trash in its most enjoyable funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find this would definitely be even greater experience if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point but fortunately those segments are very few this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i don t mention here and it wouldn t be even necessary to tell them all here if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek i think you ll love this little gem as i do and the director is definitely a genius in this field perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal 
i turned this on to see the incredible ethel waters whose autobiography i am now reading i ll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece it s pretty much a short film made by blacks for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time old trends exaggerated for humor we see modern black movies do the same thing but with the new trends stereotypes ho s and the hood and such i think if you look back in eighty years you would find today s movies will look just as racist what viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of waters and the pint sized sammy davis jr who out taps his contemporary shirley temple and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it why not enjoy it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been 
given the opposite circumstance of where the reality is we do have a black president this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time but also found the music and dancing incredible also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor he plays rufus jones a young boy who is being consoled by his mammy he is told why some day you could be president this was so ridiculous in that it was mocked and thought to be endearing charming and funny the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist church the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in it is really well done and very entertaining i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president but that it is normal just makes this movie that much more relevant it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness 
sure this movie wasn t like blocks inside man an american haunting etc but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us i found this movie really great and scary i live exactly where they filmed this movie san pedro california and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie i dunno if you ve heard of the famous boat in long beach queen mary well that boat is haunted i believe in spirts illusions and parallel or however u spell that is real everybody s in there own universe and the mind is a powerful thing i recommend to watch this movie it s great and not bad directing at all for those who rate it a they don t understand the film its meaning its plot its view and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us ty victor
one of the great classic comedies not a slapstick comedy not a heavy drama a fun satirical film a buyers beware guide to a new home filled with great characters all of whom cary grant is convinced are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home a great look at life in the late s 
i also saw this upon its release in and have been struck since then with its final scene if this is an answer to high noon then it s an apt and apposite response the notion that as this string is headed the town comes together is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of high noon in this theme concho is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all time favorites the magnificent seven both sinatra and conrad give impressive and convincing performances especially sinatra s transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior i can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years i ve inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves 
i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england i ve seen hundreds of films since but i ve never forgotten this one although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character he was excellent in the role a lot of people seem to think that he did nt really come into his own until his role in from here to eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in concho the other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad i d never see or heard of him before this film conrad plays a terrific part in this film i remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character also i remember the music that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears an excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color i remember sinatra s blue shirt 
 still crazy is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time it has been erroneously compared to this is spinal tap which it has no relation to spinal tap is a satire and quite frankly not a very good one in spite of it s outing of many rock clich s unlike tap still crazy is populated by great actors great songs and great human situations you care about the people in still crazy that s all that matters oh yeah the music s pretty damn good too written by mick jones of foreigner and chris difford of squeeze american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea the crying game but would only later become familiar with bill nighy underworld love actually pirates of the caribbean ii and timothy spall the harry potter movies 
i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was superb although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance and billy connolly as always totally gorgeous it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a well written superbly acted and good looking movie 
i watched the movie in a preview and i really loved it the cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious another highlight of the movie is definitely the music which hopefully will be released soon i recommend it to everyone who likes the british humour and especially to all musicians go and see it s great 
i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years a successful band from the s decide to give it another try they start by playing some gigs in some seedy european venues with hilarious results the music is fantastic the script and acting are terrific the characters are spot on especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice makeup and personality problems the concert at the end was unreal go and see it preferably in a cinema with a good sound system 
an excellent cast makes this movie work all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it s clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie it s not quite the comedy i expected much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor for music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny i hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies but so much of this movie reminded me of alan parker films i can t help it imagine if the commitments actually did make it big and then tried to recapture said glory years later 
i thought this movie was fantastic it was hilarious kinda reminded me of spinal tap this is a must see for any fan of s rock i hope me and my friends aren t like that in twenty years bill nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together but not succeeding well if you love music and were ever in a band this movie is definitely for you you won t regret seeing this movie i know i don t even my family found it funny and that s saying something 
in the voice over which begins the film hughie billy connolly a roadie for the great s band strange fruit said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop strange fruit s set was that god was sick of s excess indeed it s been popular to put down that era of music and see punk as a welcome antidote to it while i agree the excess was tiresome as well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it and like punk i still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock and this film about strange fruit s long strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days one of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes brian gibson directed what s love got to do with it about tina turner while i had problems with the dramatic parts of the film the music was handled very well writers dick clement and ian le frenais co wrote the commitments and were behind the music oriented british tv show over the rainbow and the songs strange fruit played were co written by foreigner s mick jones not to be confused with the clash s mick jones so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about also two cast members are musicians in their own right bill nye i don t know about though the film credits him with his own singing and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era while jimmy nail was in another british tv show which was music oriented though i forget the name and he was in evita and the others are convincing at it and while as i said a lot of s bands like strange fruit behaved badly towards women the movie doesn t make the same mistake except for the woman who follows timothy spall around as the manager of the reunion juliet aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character the other actors are all good as well with special praise to stephen rea who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality there are a couple of plot points which don t work but overall this is quite enjoyable oh yeah and the music is good too 
so i rented still crazy instead when i described hardcore logo to the guy at the video store he said that sounded kind of like still crazy so i rented it was i disappointed well yes as still crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band but that s ok still crazy tells the story of the strange fruit a rock band that broke up in the s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival twenty years later the band members are all struggling to make a living and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival they take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis touring europe in the process some quite funny hijinks ensue and all the characters go through subtle changes watching this movie you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant and that s not bad at all 
what happens to washed up rock n roll stars in the late s they launch a comeback reunion tour at least that s what the members of strange fruit a fictional s stadium rock group do tony stephen rea has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival it was at that festival in the s that strange fruit broke up the s are retro and the time is right to wide that wave he sets off in search of the other members of the band part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of keith the lead singer and brilliant song writer the band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came beano the drummer played by timothy spall who was brilliant in secrets and lies is a layabout the bass player is a roofer and their lead singer is still a rocker while he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it as his fortune has not lasted brian the lead guitarist is dead so a young guitarist is hired to replace him somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try abandoning their day jobs they begin to rehearse and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums but he wants them to start touring again first and so they hit the club circuit around europe the club scene is not kind to these overweight dated old rockers it is on tour that the film really starts to develop all of the old conflicts rearise with the figures of keith and brian hovering throughout they all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier and they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable still crazy starts as spinal tap ii but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film following the relationships of the band members while it is still a very funny movie it is the evolving characters struggling to deal with the deaths of brian and keith and with their own personal demons that make the film work 
 contrary to most reviews i ve read i didn t feel this followed any of the other rock movies spinal tap etc the story was more unique although i feel most people wanted to see the sex drugs rock and roll vices that the band kept alluding to as an american i knew a few of the actors spall connelly rea surprised to find out brian bruce robinson was in zifferedi s sp classic romeo juliet guess i ll have to rent that next the flame still burns my wife who hails from mexico didn t follow the english british language too well missed some of the jokes which i dutifully explained but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene she loves the song so much now funny that amazon com has the soundtrack for usd when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal mart for usd price non withstanding i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since 
the funky yet strictly second tier british glam rock band strange fruit breaks up at the end of the wild n wacky excess ridden s the individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful s morose keyboardist stephen rea winds up penniless and down on his luck vain neurotic pretentious lead singer bill nighy tries and fails to pursue a floundering solo career paranoid drummer timothy spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt and surly bass player jimmy nail installs roofs for a living former loving groupie turned patient understanding long suffering manager juliet aubrey gets the group back together for an ill advised largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of europe our lovably ragged bunch try gamely but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day scraggly zonked out roadie billy connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist hans matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy trouble plagued but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride director brian gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud ringing flamboyantly overblown preening s rock in general this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big hearted charm and tireless verve the astute sharply written script by dick clement and ian la frenais likewise bristles with spot on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow ashley rowe s lovely elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right on rockin flair and aplomb kudos also to the across the board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt out soul and tattered but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success all in all this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the s 
i m years old a guitarist lead rhythm and over the last forty years i ve been in four bands it s all there the fights the foul ups the rotten food the worse accommodation always travelling little or no money and every one was drunk or high but the clubs the fans and the music made it all worth it just like strange fruit i m too damn old for it now and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking but for the length of that video it all came back and it was all there the birds the brawls and the booze and i was young again it s just like billy connolly s voice over god likes that s stuff rock on forever 
musings pure delight from beginning to end not a laugh riot but a more subtle sophisticated humor what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors including reginald denny nestor paiva ian wolfe harry shannon and jason robards sr cary grant is at the building sight of his new home which is at that point being framed a young carpenter played by future tarzan lex barker asks him if he wants his lallies to be rabbeted or some such thing that only a carpenter would know grant not wanting to appear ignorant replies in the affirmative at that barker yells up to his mates ok boys he wants em rabbeted so yank em out a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about big nails being pulled out of various boards all grant can do is moan yes the movie is dated you d never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home and a place like that in connecticut of all places would probably run a few million bucks a classic movie that is really a treasure 
i found still crazy to be marvelously entertaining and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late s early s rock my year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd don t worry it s only been three times and she loves it too it is a truly loving poignant and hilarious nod to the era and every actor hits his her notes with perfection it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in love actually brought him more attention bruce robinson was incredible as brian bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug damaged rocker stereotype it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer i live in sherman oaks california and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall he lived here at the time and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time we even talked of the idea of an american oriented remake before wisely dismissing that why mess with the original my only problem with still crazy is that it wasn t hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience 
hello i was alanrickmaniac i m a still crazy holic it was just another movie i watched partly on tv then i had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends then i wanted the dvd because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks after the dvd i had to lay my hands on the soundtrack then on several film posters and the film script right now it has become that worse that i try to push other people into addiction with my website and still crazy parties how could that happen what drove me into addiction ok it s one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the british can produce alright the movie is worlds apart from stuff like this is spinal tap because of the characters that aren t childish or ultra cool but real this is a story about men getting older too a story about men getting along with each other or don t it contains some of the best actors possible tim spall stephen rea bruce robinson jimmy nail and bill nighy bill nighy who puts on one of the best performances i ve ever seen in a film good the soundtrack is unbelievable foreigner s mick jones has written the songs for the imaginary band strange fruit jimmy nail who plays bass man les wickes and bill nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer ray simms are really singing we know that about jimmy nail but if you ve only heard bill nighy s singing in love actually you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is well you ll fever for every scene to come for the x th time especially those concert scenes you d die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when strange fruit is doing all over the world singing on the top of your lungs you long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real strange fruit at wisbech s festival stage it s hard but i m addicted to this film i m addicted to strange fruit if there s a world where this band really exists i d like to move there got still crazy anyone 
this movie is tremendous for uplifting the spirits every time i watch it i see hear funny little things that i missed before the soundtrack is unbelievable mick jones foreigner and chris difford squeeze penned the songs making strange fruit the best thing that ever hit today s music scene unfortunately strange fruit are a strictly fictitional washed up s to s band that were never good to begin with due to drug use and inner fighting one wonders what might have been while listening to their fanatstic soundtrack the fruit draw inspiration from the rolling stones deep purple david bowie and the who each member of fruit are quite memorable stephen rea stars as down and dead broke tony costello who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour with hopes of reaping monetary benefits costello haply approaches ex roadie karen knowles played by juliet aubrey to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past juliet gathers up the bitter jimmy nail les wickes blundering timothy spall david beano baggot and extravagantly glamouresque ray simms bill nighy tumbling in is another ex roadie the hippy toker jokester hughie billy connolly who never let the flame burn out as juliet searches for the last member of their motley band the elusive guitarist songwriter brian lovell played by the brooding bruce robinson the reunited members squabble just like old times fighting over each others rusty talent the band is then given the chance to do a small dutch tour to prepare for the festival with young hendrix like luke shand hans matheson taking the place of lovell the crew hits the road the sparks fly as their memories flame forward threatening to burn their unfinished goals be prepared to laugh sing cheer and cry as these memorable characters etch themselves back into your hearts 
not to be confused with the resse witherspoon high school film of the same name this is a stylised look at hong kong s triad gangs called election because a new leader or chairman is elected by ancient traditions every two years two candidates are up for the position and through ego bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory the asian godfather this is not but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence subtitled volume i think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right 
this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy s law being applied to home ownership and construction if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional since it was set in the simpler forties we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment 
this isn t as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who s side a particular character is on the plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it follows the violence when it comes is brutal no guns or martial art scenes with special effects this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisation the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable 
there can be no denying that hak se wui election in english is a well made and well thought out film the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition a theme played with throughout the film where john woo s hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the bad point of view they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable a good example being city on fire election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful if that s the right word manner as well as the clever little in pieces of film making it s difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say goes the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run needless to say certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested this happens a few times a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested there s a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested some other triads are having a pre election talk but the police show up and guess what you know once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it s been hotwired another chase involving a motorbike and a kung fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street the scenes are unpredictable realistic and violent but like i said they are in a tasteful manner where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail when the triads are in jail the bars are covered with wire suggesting they re all animals in cages as that s how they behave on the outside when in conflict another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol elevating themselves above other head gangsters who d use champagne the long good friday and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise en scene as you look at what s going on some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film hinting at chinese tradition in the process i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic unpredictable and violent in a tasteful manner of course 
election is a chinese mob movie or triads in this case every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader and at first it seems a toss up between big d tony leung ka fai or as i know him the other tony leung and lok simon yam who was judge in full contact though once lok wins big d refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader unlike any other asian film i watch featuring gangsters this one is not an action movie it has its bloody moments when necessary as in goodfellas but it s basically just a really effective drama there are a lot of characters which is really hard to keep track of but i think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit a year old baton which is the symbol of power i mentioned before changes hands several times before things settle down and though it may appear that the film ends at the or minute mark there are still a couple big surprises waiting simon yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture election was quite the award winner at last year s hong kong film awards winning for best actor tony leung best picture best director johnny to who did heroic trio and best screenplay it also had nominations for cinematography editing film score which i loved and three more acting performances including yam 
first off i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence i say unfortunately because after seeing election first election seems a bit of a disappointment both films are gangster epics that are similar in form and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema it s just not nearly as good as it s sequel in the first election installment we are shown the two competitors for chairman big d and lok after a few scenes of discussion amongst the uncle s as to who should have the chairman title they almost unanimously decide that lok simon yam will helm the triads suffice to say this doesn t go over very well with competitor big d tony leung ka fai and in a bid to influence the takeover big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war lok is determined to become chairman but won t become official until he can recover the dragon head baton a material representation of the chairman s power the current chairman whistle chung wang has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election which involves an underling named jet nick cheung a machete and lots of bad guys nick cheung s presence is attention grabbing to say the least i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election as he does deliver more of jet s character in the sequel while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film s actors election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo tony leung ka fai and the under appreciated suet lam there really aren t any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they re watching real gangsters although the performances are great one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to s eye for the camera there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles all of which makes election above all a great looking film my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren t integral to the plot while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles underlings and police officers crowding the storyline maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more bottom line all in all this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast excellent direction and leisurely pacing that packs a punch it s just a little more complicated than it needed to be 
i spotted in the guide to films list for the santa barbara film festival where i went when i was in hollywood that this film was in screening basically there is an election for the new chairman of the hong kong triads wo sing society coming up so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this the struggle is between candidates lam lok simon yam and big d tony leung ka fai for control of the oldest and most powerful triad parts of the society also starring louis koo as jimmy lee nick cheung as jet cheung siu fai as mr so lam suet as big head and lam ka tung as kun there are some good realistic corruption themes and moments just about enough action apart from maybe when the cops get involved but a sequel followed so it s a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller very good 
i always thought this would be a long and boring talking heads flick full of static interior takes dude i was wrong election is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller drama taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads rituals characters are constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider it s still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light shadow contrasts although there s hardly any action the ending is still shocking in it s ruthless depicting of brutality cool movie that deserves more attention and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit 
the first of two films by johnny to this film won many awards but none so prestigious as a cannes golden palm nomination the triad elects their leader but it is far from democratic with the behind the scenes machinations tony leung ka fai zhou yu s train ashes of time redux is big d who plans to take the baton no matter what it takes even if it means a war well war is not going to happen as that is bad for business big d will change his tune or good performances by simon yam louis koo and ka tung lam infernal affairs i iii along with tony leung ka fai whether masons made men in the mafia or members of the wo sing society the ceremonies are the same fascinating to watch to be continued 
election marks the nd trial society theme movie directed by johnnie to to marvellously casted simon yan and tony leung kar fai as lok and big d as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for ho sing society a year old trial society while lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times big d is not only impatient but also thinks that he is on top of everything lok was chosen as the next chairman for years to have the total control of the gang the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a dragon baton which represents power and authority big d was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members he ordered his man to get the baton before it falls onto the hands of lok while big d is getting the baton lok has other plans for him this is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed johnnie to puts the greed of the human beings in the movie where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one however no single bullet is used hardly any gangfights are involved in election it s the battle of the wits that makes election stands out of the rest apart from maggie shiu the only actress in election with less than lines to talk in the whole movie masculinity rules the whole movie louis koo and nick cheung who was seen in to s previous film are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script it makes the only hk movie to represent cannes fil festival election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie 
australia s first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang and a stab and a slice and a scream or two and plenty of blood frights red herrings and lots of laughs in fact there s lots of first surrounding cut it s the first script of dave warner s to be produced although he has several others either optioned or in negotiation it s the first major film from director and former hoodoo guru kimble rendall and it s also the first film for producer martin fabinyi and for a bunch of guys dipping their toes into this genre for the first time they sure know their stuff cut tells the story of a bunch of australian film students who hear about a slasher film hot blooded that was never finished because its director hilary kylie minogue was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film despite their lecturer who was assistant director on the night hilary died warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of hot blooded again someone dies director raffy jessica napier and producer hester sarah kants decide to go ahead and complete the film they put together a crew and manage to get the original star vanessa turnbill molly ringwald to return to australia in fact to the original location to complete hot blooded years after shooting shut down of course this being a slasher film lots of bloodletting ensues long with plenty of laughs a few good scares and a rocking aussie soundtrack cut shows that australia can make a good mass market horror film just as well as hollywood it s a finely crafted feature with excellent special effects a taut plot and a killer scarman that s a welcome addition to the ranks of michael jason and freddy 
i was really excited about seeing this film i thought finally australia had made a good film but i was wrong this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie the acting was terrible especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent and the plot was also pretty bad when i first heard about this film coming out i thought that the title was pathetic because it sounds like the cheesy film stab in scream but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie warning major spoilers probably the worst thing about the film was the ending i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was but the killer wasn t even human which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie don t see this film you ll probably be disappointed 
i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was well that was because it isn t supposed to be taken so seriously basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job there seems to be another movie coming out like that too umm scary movie well this is aussie and original jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting i hope to see more of them molly ringwald was a good move and kylie was an even better move the impossible princess was queen of the screen i recommend seeing this flick as you ll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy hilary and the movie that never got finished years ago 
i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it which was sometime last year anyway i got to see today and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after mins or so i thought that the movie was pretty good but the thing i didn t like was how the killer was created i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends final cut i almost died it mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved cut is times better than ul final cut the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes the killer kicks mo f ing ass i give cut a out of 
it isn t the worst film ever made the actors aren t apalling and the script and director are not completely inept it isn t the best film ever made the actors aren t excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant it falls somewhere in the middle a fun somewhere an enjoyable well constructed somewhere no need to say don t take it seriously or so bad its good or it wasn t scary none of these comments are relevant cut has atmosphere it s that atmosphere which is actually very unique and the one really original aspect of the movie which personally is what makes the film for me 
 cut is a full tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do most of the standard slasher cliches are there the old creepy house the woods the anonymous indestructible serial killer buckets of gore and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they re having sex that s hardly a spoiler the set up is simplicity itself film school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast this also neatly okay messily disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines the rest of the cast fit their roles well especially the lovely jessica napier who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace it also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate good soundtrack too if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send up of or a homage to the slasher genre probably a bit of both 
this is not a bad movie it follows the new conventions of modern horror that is the movie within a movie the well known actress running for her life in the first scene this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose and manage to do something new and interesting with it it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack so this might be an example of what the genre has become cut hits all the marks and is actually scary in some parts i liked it i gave it an eight 
this is surprisingly above average slasher that s enjoyable and well made with some decent gore all the characters are decent and the story is quite fun plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well i bought this at a pawn shop for a and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy the finale was really cool as i loved how they defeated the killer and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable it s decently made and written and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well plus some of the death scenes were very impressive this killer didn t mess around and i loved it and slasher fans like myself should really enjoy this film plus the opening was really wicked too with them filming the movie this is a surprisingly above average slasher that s enjoyable and well made with some decent gore and i say it s well worth the watch the direction is good kimble rendall does a good job here with solid camera work using a creepy setting good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace the acting is solid molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well and i had troubles feeling sorry for her after all she was supposed to be the heroine she turned out better towards the end but not by much i m surprised she decided to do this film nonetheless she did an excellent job frank roberts is fantastic as the killer he is menacing creepy and had one hell of a mask and this guy didn t mess around he was fantastic kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine rest of the cast are fine overall well worth the watch out of 
come on people this movie is better than i can see this happening wealthy people have done crazier things than this and it was funny i watch a comedy to be entertained escape from the pressures of the world for a short while and not to have to take anything too seriously this movie fully suits that purpose i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home it will remain on my list of favorite must watch for the holiday season if you just want to have a fun minutes watch this one 
you can survive surviving christmas i thought the television version was a bit edited way down i like ben afleck he plays drew johnson a family less adult who is willing to pay complete strangers the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco the daughter drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn t have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars bill macy who i best remember for playing maude s husband arthur is hired to play duda the grandfather when the whole situation comes crashing down the truth can be painful the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation drew s rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit you can t buy what you wish for the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene 
i had some reservations about this movie i figured it would be the usual bill of fare a formula movie about christmas being in the middle of a heat wave in late june we decided to give it a shot anyway maybe we would see some snow this movie turned out to be one laugh after another ben affleck was believable in his character but the real star of this one is james gandofini he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great dad if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours definitely check this one out 
this movie isn t as bad as i heard it was enjoyable funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year i heard that ben s character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time take it for what is it a christmas comedy with a love twist i enjoyed it no it isn t titanic and it won t make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two so go laugh and have a good time 
i was greatly moved when i watched the movie how jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing so many people only care about what they want and fuss about all the things they don t have and they are such small things like chothes money a new car i ve seen people in tears because of a blemish this movie brings everything back to the basics love hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really unimportant you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food a roof over your head and your loved ones around you you are truly blessed and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning and i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith strenght and humor with me thank you jonny i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above 
this man is nothing short of amazing you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events and cry along with his family in the end he was so passionate about his cause not just for himself but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain i watch this video every time i am having a bad or down day and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life just like jonny did even with his unbearable pain my only regret is not knowing about jonny sooner as i visited england times during his life and would have been able to say i d met him it is comforting to know jonny is sitting on his cloud pain free rest in peace dear jonny you deserve it 
in september year old jonny kennedy died he had a terrible genetic condition called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa eb which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer in his last months jonny decided to work with filmmaker patrick collerton to document his life and death and the result was a film first broadcast in march that was an uplifting confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man not shying away from the grim reality of eb the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full produced and directed by patrick collerton and first shown in march the boy whose skin fell off has become the most talked about documentary of that year it attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to jonny s charity debra a jonny kennedy memorial fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that jonny kennedy left a one million pound legacy 
was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions so i turned to my twin sister and said hey this looks like fun truly i love documentaries so we started watching it at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man but then it was explained that due to his condition he never went through puberty thus the high voice and smaller body he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality i cried watched some more laughed got up to get another kleenex then cried some more once jonni kennedy s time was up he flew to heaven to be with the angels he was more than ready he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free i highly recommend this if you do not fall in love with this guy you have no heart 
i couldn t hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary it was heart breaking disturbing and inspiring all in one i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives or simply something that will make you think you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us his life and struggles will make you cry laugh and find that life s a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time 
a most recommendable masterpiece not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos not to mention the acting of giants mastroianni and moreau and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis gregory karr s performance may seem overshadowed by his tough partners at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl khrysikou and the man mastroianni albeit hinted beforehand hence the spoiler get your expectations straight it s an art movie in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention not for spending free time but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert due to the overall photographic style large screen viewing is recommended dialogues are used sparingly but the film includes in addition to the standard greek and english speaking fragments spoken in albanian kurdish and turkish which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages 
enjoyed this film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially william powell dr lawrence bradford mister roberts who played the role as a doctor and detective dr bradford was once married to jean arthur paula bradford shane and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important jean arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe especially with a jockey on a california race track robert armstrong nick martel king kong gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with james gleason a detective who need the help of dr bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery if you see this film just remember it was produced and directed in and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in those days 
i ve seen the thin man series powell and loy are definitely great but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthur s chemistry in this flick jean arthur shines when she looks at powell there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them this film may not have the wit of the thin man series but undeniably makes up for it in charm while i watched it i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off screen affair with arthur my friends thought the same this is one film where i wish i could step back in time to schmooze and lock lips with powell there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks powell s character lawrence bradford is probably the closest thing to the perfect man okay this is sounding way too gushy but i can t help myself 
the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever powell is probably the most suave detective of the s and arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells they are extremely fun to watch so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold eric blore also has some comic turns as powell s butler powell s contract with mgm included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio but he wanted to work again with arthur and he liked the script so he eagerly accepted the assignment they had worked together in two paramount films the canary murder case and the greene murder case both in the philo vance series 
five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas but it features some of the best hand to hand fight sequences in hong kong film history director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms meng lo plays yet another bad ass he would go on to be in super ninjas kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled any chop socky fan can apperciate this but i still think it ain t as good as super ninjas also made by chang cheh but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best 
after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin i bought it on dvd hence the spin pun i m a dork the beginning was everything i hoped for a perfect set up along with some quotes that i ve heard on various wu tang albums to what should have been a good movie but the plot i heard was so great was so predictable every time i saw a character except for the lizard i guessed which venom he was plus the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie ok so the plot wasn t very good but at least there was some good kung fu right wrong the fights were very short and few and far between granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than total minutes but it never happened in short not much happens the fighting is all pretty routine don t be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot it does not mean it s a good one 
this movie is really good the plot which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess what will happen next such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle fighting scenes are very good there s a lot of different combat styles although one of styles was a bit unreal for me but it s only my opinion to watch and it s fascinating show the only thing which may be irritating is actors look a bit too effeminate at least for me hong kong was always good at kung fu movies especially in the s and s so five venoms or other its versions is great choice 
i really like this movie i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie the story is very interesting it introduces us to characters each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other the dying master sends the th venom his last student to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed how will the last pupil find the other venoms how will he know which of them is bad the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great we also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination it is fun to see how their styles match up against each other if you want to see if you like kung fu movies this is a good movie to start with it doesn t get any better than this 
if you love kung fu films and you haven t seen this movie you are cheating yourself this movie is one of the only kung fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film normally it takes a die hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films but this one has it all the story is well told and complete the fight scenes are great and tend to end before you re completely bored with them unlike crouching tiger throw in a little mystery and torture and you ve got yourself one heck of a movie see this one at all costs heck my wife even enjoyed it wu du it out of 
by the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over as films were moving in a different direction comedically and otherwise with television looming on the horizon hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time where one wonders would movies have gone had television not come along or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years mr blandings builds his dream house offers one particular way comedy might have developed ad man jim blandings along with his wife and two daughters are living in a nice but way too cramped new york city apartment as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs so he buys some property in connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications well almost had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind then again he might not have you decide on this frail premise a wonderful film results full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one s own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one nothing comes easy in this life as mr blandings learns but one needn t be miserable just because things don t always go one s way there is after all the long run but blandings asks himself every few minutes how long is long this movie is a delight it is not i suppose a masterpiece in the capra mccarey tradition but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically there is real warmth in the picture and a good deal of w c fieldsian hard edged reality obtruding periodically but not so much as to leave a bad taste the people in the film are all very smart and affluent but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class lead players cary grant and myrna loy plays mr and mrs blandings to perfection while melvyn douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend who often has to bring up unpleasant topics such as how the real world works there is too a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place these people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural connecticut in a few short years things would change as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns which soon would be connected by highways littered with bottles and cans their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city 
 in the world of old school kung fu movies where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen it took a lot for a film to stand out and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years what is arguably chang cheh s finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry from the themes of loyalty brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late s to more modern movies like a man called hero which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film the influence has also carried into other areas as well from music such as the wu tang clan tv commercials for sprite and video games such as mortal kombat so what makes this movie so special the plot on the surface is pretty simple it deals with members of a rogue group known as the poison clan who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities denoted by their animal styles or venoms the lizard can climb walls the scorpion has a deadly strike etc the twist is that since the clan always wears masks not all of them known who the others are thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller we re not talking the usual suspects here but it s far above many other kung fu movies of the time supposedly golden harvest was not too happy with chang s script like most of his movies they felt it was too dark and violent and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it thankfully chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time if not ever completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast not only did he gain talented martial artists whose moves competed without the aid of wires or other special effects put most modern martial artists to shame but great actors as well the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies getting back to matters at hand in most old school movies the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts but here the actors actually create characters it seems that everyone has a favorite venom mine is philip kwok best known to many as mad dog from hard boiled as lizard and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre even if you re normally not a fan of old school movies you need to check the five deadly venoms out if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from 
there s no romance or other side plot to this movie it s action and intrigue all the way making it a real man s kung fu movie an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who s styles represents five venomous animals centipede snake scorpion lizard and the toad despite the word venom in the title none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents yan tieh told by his teacher that he s no match for the five former pupil must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story with good kung fu action spread out throughout the story recognized as a cult classic this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung fu action movies it s known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story it s no artistic masterpiece with the usual bad dubbing and corny acting but the movie is one of the best of its kind because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung fu action movie of its time and gives an extra concentrated dose of them one movie you must watch if you are a kung fu movie fan 
most s and s kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies usually there are a few well planned fight sequences but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes like porno films really but this one does several things well most overtly there is the direction and choreography which confines each combatant to a style it s really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater but the effect works second there is the language of the camera which uses some impressive techniques even by today s measure changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future least overt but most powerful and unexpected is the construction the winner of this contest is determined by who unfolds the story the master the writer sets up a game where the lead character doesn t know who he s seeking which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in one by one he figures out who is who at the same rate we find out who is who it all follows a tragedy noir arc the ending tends toward irony a la the sting much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre the five venoms idea is the template for tarantino s deadly viper assassins from the kill bill volumes 
the five deadly venoms is a great kung fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery there are all the usual telltale signs of a kung fu flick great choreography awful dubbing different styles of fighting and a wide range of greatly exaggerated often cheesey human emotions however the plot certainly is better than average it s interesting and holds your attention throughout the non fight scenes occasionally it s even able to fire up the audience such as when x character receives horrible injustice another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie s morals and themes just about everyone gets what s coming to them the cowardly greedy and corrupt lose out the bad guys consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing the good guys use teamwork planning and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top poison clan rocks 
i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv the one scene that always stands out for me that is is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says did you get that that s yellow blue green and white 
this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever and may be one of the best movies ever it s got a great plot that functions like a puzzle with lots of intrigue and suspense this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions with people hiding their identities and their natures the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality s and desires the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy there are members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film when this happens the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective we actually care when people are killed in this film this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain at the same time this is also a fun movie it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film there is bad dubbing the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic all this just adds to the greatness of the film and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic everything goes by so fast because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is the lighting and composition are spectacular at times the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it s confines he doesn t rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level it s art it s trash it s emotionally moving and it s fun it has a true sense of morality but doesn t allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not 
i would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes you people are so damn sensitive it is inane so quick to point out the racism of the show and the jokes yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist pig headed crap like well duh some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women so disgusting abortion jokes are great because really who takes abortion seriously anyways at least i m not a bore son i hear that reba mcentire and sarah silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together talk about a movie of the year 
i have to vote this out of in the rare chance that she happens to see this review takes pity on me whisks me to hollywood and involves me in her freaky funny world but in all seriousness it was good first episode is obviously finding it s feet but it s got that silverman weirdness running all the way through it it s not a laugh out loud sort of comedy but that s good thing too much has a laughter track to it and this wouldn t be right with cues when to laugh it s to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all i can easily see this as being the bizarro drew carey show with it s weird characters and incredibly strong central character well worth a watch look forward to the following episodes a very good chance from the usual comedy out there ps sarah call me 
following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarah s erratic persona which beyond general insensitivity has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene sarah s ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed every time she speaks it s like a self contained second skit she overemotes a lot demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied this may be the most creative original and experimental tv program ever 
when i first saw this show i thought it looked interesting i watched it saw how it revolved around sarah like the character sees the world revolving around her i got it but wasn t laughing very much onstage and in her show she s racist crude insensitive and hugely self centered i didn t get her at first and took it all at face value then i got to see her movie jesus is magic i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me explaining to me just what language she s speaking she s like marilyn manson working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images but you eventually realise it isn t an assault it s a statement and once you understand that you find you re glad someone s finally giving it to you straight i don t mean to suggest only smart people will understand or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy while i like a lot of smart shows i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm i get the impression that it s good but i just don t get it many people will never get the sarah silverman program but i m glad i eventually came around the creators of this show do work hard every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot but with songs or dream sequences production numbers these people aren t putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together if i was to predict the future of this show i d say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks geeks it will get canceled before it s time and live on in fans hearts and on dvd but take heart ssp creators your audience is out there and we ll be watching for as long as they let you make the show 
big s isn t playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like say mencia or chapelle though i like them both she states the obvious in subtle near subliminal remarks her show won t change the world nor is it meant to but along with the hilarious brian posehn and paget brewster s ex boyfriend jay johnston of mr show fame this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction my side s were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode look i love this woman and like her famed boyfriend jimmy kimmel she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run with it the best kind of comedy around spoofing anything and anyone like mary poppins in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense this one is highly recommended but only for those who still have a funny bone and didn t lose it in their most recent lippo suction treatment or boob job 
i think this show is screamingly funny it s not for every taste and i m not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that don t get it i m sure they re wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength but if you like it you really like it sarah plays a self infatuated loser named sarah silverman who often finds her self in homerian predicaments that s homerian as in homerian simpsonian i remember sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the early s i liked her immediately then and i go out of my way to check out anything she s done this show is choke on your food and wet your pants funny therefore i always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers check it out 
i originally scored sarah s show with a nice fat but i ve struggled a bit with her humor of late and a thin is what s settled in i shall explain you will either like sarah s humor or you won t if you don t i doubt anyone could persuade you you folks know who you are and it s perfectly fine but then you know that too moving on the first season gave us fantastic bits about sarah her friends and family and her pursuits in life in one memorable episode she is pulled over by officer jay whom she meets for the first time do you know why i am standing here he asks because you got all c s in high school she quizzically replies it seemed to be a genuine question that is funny stuff in my book sarah can come at you from odd angles in another episode her affair with god was notably funny god being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke it is clever it is a twisted view but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughed then came the second season while still not without some new and inventive comedy we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal poop and fart jokes quite simply i get some good laughs here and there but much of it seems like filler while she and the writers struggle to foment some original material sophomoric and tiresome are the feelings i have for the episodes lately but i have been gutting it out for the gems i do find the turtle and waiting for her to turn it around i was a fan of her jesus is magic routine and would like to think that i understand what she is capable of let s get back to that 
this show probably won t appeal to everyone sarah does what she wants she doesn t ask for permission and she doesn t apologize this is a sitcom with zombies robot dinosaurs flying cars and a team of wallet stealing male cheerleaders the star of the show is not a hero she is a spoiled bigoted pervert if you can t appreciate the offbeat humor it offers the show probably isn t for you everyone should at least give this show a chance it brings together the comedic styling of sarah silverman brian posehn the comedians of comedy jay johnston mr show steve agee bobcat goldthwait s stay and the creative energies of rob schrab and dan harmon heat vision jack monster house it also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community channel com if you re into this show keep an eye out for the department of acceptable media on vh this march it ll be drawing from the same talent pool watch sarah silverman s show this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment 
this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldn t stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight despite the fact that i ve seen all the episodes previously i ve always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience i watch this show and i laugh a very large percentage of the time i can t say that about many tv shows can you this show is finally something new and interesting and most importantly funny this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out you owe it to yourself to watch this show i predict a long run for this series and just to be clear the people who are offended by this show just don t get it perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don t understand anyone who uses the word bigot in reference to silverman or who claims that she only aims to shock is way off the mark she s exactly the opposite just google her and you ll quickly see that she s a huge proponent of civil rights etc if you don t know that she s ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints you don t get it and if you don t get it do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity 
all i can say is if you don t fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie then you re not human even after watching it for the first time i was hooked it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe as i m sure other fans will attest to after watching it you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us at least we have grey gardens to remember them i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do what a rare treat to have know such people i only wish i had 
i really can t remember who recommended this but they said it was one of their favorite films it is certainly a strange one like rubbernecking at a highway accident someone said that truth is stranger than fiction and the truth here is something to see i really can t understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year how can you improve on this the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hampton s in the process they become recluses and what is best described as crazy cat ladies they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie this film was done after that rescue all during you couldn t help but think how bad was it before it s a look at high society from the darker side and it is utterly fascinating 
one of the best love stories i have ever seen it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion but lovely nonetheless big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly and are infinitely quotable it s a goddamned beautiful day now will you just shut up the opening explanation of little edie s costume only promises that the movie will live on forever and so will big edie the world famous singer and little edie the world famous dancer 
it s interesting how the train of research can flow i started out looking at an article about cristo s the gates in central park the article stated that the maysles had been cristo s filmographers for years hmmm then i got to looking at their body of work i believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming cristo and jean claude in their stages of creation grey gardens sounded very interesting video station in boulder co is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock dvd and vhs edith and edie are women living in the past and oh what a glorious past it was edith had been well off born a bouvier married well had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties her daughter edie had been a d butante a fashion model and had many beaus she never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate she seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind worrying too much about things it is only a shadow of the world they live in though because jackie o came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted it is a room mansion that is worn down and worn out but in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls if you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess the outfits edie comes up with a very clever and creative the viewer gets the impression that edith likes to go nude but she doesn t in the movie edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings tea for two edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at it was a good movie though not for everyone when the cat is urinating behind edith s portait she states at least someone is doing what they want 
i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill jackie kennedy s sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the maysles to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women i d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating i e are they nuts or am i missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it facets does though 
little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for even though their house was filthy this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness on the message board a poster wrote that little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old this reminded me of when in the dramatized version big edie says to little edie if you re stuck it s only with yourself these women had everything beauty talent intelligence firm belief in their opinions and actions perhaps if little edie wasn t so hard on herself the first time things didn t work out losing her hair her job and the love of her life she would have made it this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead the world will never know what have happened if she didn t listen to her mom s plea come home edie let me take care of you yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant heartbreaking and lovable even in their extremely filthy home these women were extraordinary and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns dwelling about what could have been or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that everything will be okay great documentary 
grey gardens is shocking amusing sad and mesmerizing i watched in amazement as ediths jr and sr bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past their existence in a dilapidated mansion which they had not left for more than fifteen years is both a comedy and a tragedy this is a film you will not soon forget 
excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies they couldn t live together nor apart babbling constantly sometimes at the same time they hashed and re hashed the past going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda i found myself laughing at times but mostly i was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were see this one 
i took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night having no idea of the film s cult influence or that it is currently being staged as a musical most of the comments here are on target it s moving funny sad and yes a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers the expanded chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out i think you can also see in little edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared you can hear it in old films of jackie o too people just don t talk like that anymore i think as a documentary it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute old edie at least still seems aware of what s going on to a certain degree couldn t she see the once spectacular home disintegrating yet the film s subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now a real life tennesse williams one act well worth your time 
i saw this film a couple of weeks ago and it s been stuck in my head ever since it stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary to get the true story of the beales i had to wade through all of the dvd s bonus material and commentaries and search the web although the maysles and their fans not to mention edith and edie themselves bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word very little effort is every made to explain the beales or how they came to the condition they were in the maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for edith and edie to say something outrageous the sound even on the criterion re release is poor and difficult to follow although i appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film it s ironic to compare it to geraldo rivera s far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at willowbrook state school in staten island from four years before grey gardens was shot to paraphrase a review in the new yorker there were many things edith and edie needed in their lives and a documentary wasn t one of them as for edith and edie the thing i kept thinking while watching the film was where the hell is their family they were living in dangerous unhealthy unsafe conditions how is it that jackie o married to one of the richest men on earth or the wealthy bouvier family themselves couldn t afford to get edith and edie a decent home or at the very least hire a part time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both it s shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire bouvier family although this review may sound negative i would strongly recommend grey gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary bringing in the rich backstory and afterstory of the beales and the whole subsection of hamptons society in the s 
i found grey garden s to be a gripping film an amazingly intimate look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea forget society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge brood of cats and raccoons persuing their own interests rather mundainly all the while chattering at the camera big edie and little edie are the two crazies that the mazles bros have chosen to document they seem like characters out of a fellini film only stranger if that makes any sense old edie is almost fully bedridden a pile of papers clothes and dirty dishes growing around her little edie is even more interesting she prances around the house always wearing a baboushka like headdress around her head completely covering her hair we never see her hair throughout the film nor do we ever get a hint that she still has much at age fifty eight though she is still beautiful and full of life in grey gardens we get the sense that both of these women s lives have become much less than what they once were little edie is probably the sadder of the two while her mother in her earlier years got married made a family lived luxuriously and even made some recordings the scene where at she sings along with a recording of tea for two she made decades ago is one of the films best scenes edie left her promicing career as a model to take care of her ailing mother at she still longed to find her prince charming if anything little edie is still a little girl full of dreams of glamour and fame and of domestic and romantic bliss that have yet to be fulfilled highlights of the film include the opening moments where little edie explains her outfit to the camera the tea for two sequence the birthday party the climactic argument the grocery deliver scene and the scene in the attic the whole thing is incredibly candid and unpretencious and it s made all the more remarcable since it s all real i suggest seeing grey gardens back to back with the kenneth anger short puce moment the criterion dvd is but it s worth every penny 
 grey gardens is the maysles brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassis eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down room mansion on east hampton long island big edie bouvier beale witty and dry and her daughter little edie beale emotionally about a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic they amuse themselves by bickering all day listening to the radio or singing to each other they dont even own a television their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special although obviously dysfunctional people one of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today 
i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal documentary of not this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes i kept focusing on how these women who are clinically way beyond eccentric reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue blood universe perhaps some abuse or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its own this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation without going completely over the edge as the edies do their thing i kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble strewn bedroom cats urinating on the bed racoons emerging from holes in the walls and the final scene seemed incredibly sad like a child s birthday party gone seriously wrong very definitely worth seeing and seeking out you ll never forget it but very disturbing 
we stumbled upon the documentary grey gardens last sunday and got sucked in without warning everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach eating ice cream and corn on the cob which was cooked on the bedside table and the cat urinating on edith s bed and her unbelievable words i thrive on it [the smell] we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in spellbinding a must see 
trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn t yet seen renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse my son is so jaded with current b science fiction that he hasn t bothered seeing this yet it must be noted i didn t see anything about cypher when it was released in australia it must have been very quiet or i just missed it well this was a really pleasant surprise this is also no b movie it s not a blockbuster of the epic variety and doesn t try to be more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it s plot to be fully savoured the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view but they get it right at it s nd appearance that aside everything else is top notch in any case the affects are secondary i won t give anything away about the plot the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct though with very different content just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke the actor was born in cambridge england and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect it s a tad off key see the final twist of the plot and you ll see why that is such a brilliant choice and lucy liu is also just right with her will she kiss me will she shoot me edge i rarely watch movies several times within days this is one of them 
don t read anything about this movie especially nothing that could contain any spoilers just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it and you ll have a really great experience if you like to see an intelligent twisted story go get the dvd and you ll truly not be disappointed cypher is not really a sci fi movie more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business it s about corporate secrets how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness cypher is much deeper more complex and what belongs the story and the ending also much much more satisfying than vincenzo natali s other movies cube and nothing actually it s one of the best movies i ve ever seen and that s something i really don t say this about every fifth well made flick sorry can t tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience just give it a chance 
 cypher is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future while thematically not complex this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty ruthlessness and corporate conspiracy to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man morgan sullivan jeremy northam who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative after an initial briefing with digicorp s security chief sullivan is then given a new identity jack thursby and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies upon successfully completing his first assignment sullivan thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered however on one of his business trips he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster liu whom he had met on his previous assignment and from there things go extremely topsy turvy the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp s espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorp s main competitors thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies spoilers end here what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic household settings while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover up i was also very impressed with jeremy northam not too often have i seen him in the lead role and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant personally i think he s one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn t been given more challenging roles lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak and dagger tone additionally the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job however my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated for example i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second wife overall this is a cleverly developed cloak and dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future i m surprised that i had never watched this hidden gem before this is a brilliant not too overly complicated spy thriller and therefore i m giving it a out of 
modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake the money pit older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas were all superstars in an easier less complicated era or was it time of course has a way of modifying perspectives and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older seemingly less provocative films in mr blandings builds his dream house there may therefore be more than what audiences were looking for in there is political commentary however subtle finding a house in the late s was a truly exasperating experience only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like politics in the movie the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school which in real life would get teachers accused of communism in real life too myrna loy was a housing activist a democrat and a feminist melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism and which ruined her jason robards sr has a small role in the film but his political activism was no less noticeable more importantly his son jason robards jr would be for many years a very active liberal democrat almost the odd fellow out was cary grant whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping but this was communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films and then not so subtly 
cypher is a clever effective and eerie film that delivers its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands although one could immediately label the film a science fiction there is a little more to it it has it s obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story the film overall plays out like it s some kind of nightmare thus building and retaining a good atmosphere we re never sure of what exactly is going on we re never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we re not entirely sure of certain people similar to having a dream the ambiguity reigns over us all hero included and i haven t seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before bar terry gilliam s brazil going with the eeriness stated earlier cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there s something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster liu who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero people whom appear as friends actually aren t people who say they re helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look despite a lot of switching things around twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they re not carried out the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy liu s character and she s trying to help out the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini cold war something that resembles the u s a and the u s s r in their war of word s heyday and it really pulls through given the black bleak often cgi littered screen that i was glued to what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations significant then how the more he acts on his and foster s own motivation this sequence disappears because he s breaking away from the computerised repetitive controlled life that he s being told to live and is branching out cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film to say it resembles the first jason bourne film only set in the sci fi genre isn t cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities despite them both being released in the same year like i mentioned earlier there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict you will find yourself enjoying this film 
this movie is a gem because it moves with soft but firm resolution i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace it s not about explosions car chases or flying bullets you must be patient and instead note the details here it s sedate because that s what the main character is the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds i will not give spoilers because that destroys the point of watching the plot is what you ve read from the other postings an average white collar guy seeking change and adventure signs on for a corporate spy job just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data take it from there this movie starts at a surreal walk with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential underlying suburban paranoia then it begins to accelerate the acting on all parts is superb and yes some of the acts are caricature characters but they all fit and they entertain and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft soft key sinister theme all is not right at the beginning and at the end all is not what it seems get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one and turn up the sound this movie wants you to listen 
i ve seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now and i wan tell it s one the best movies i ve ever seen in my life what you need to know is that you don t have to miss any minute of this movie if you don t completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end the end is what makes this movie so good you can t expect it congratulations to the producer 
who can watch a movie look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed that woman is amazingly beautiful a talented actress that s a tough combination to find now a days and jeremy northam i heard his name plenty of times but i never really noticed him my advice to hollywood is use him more now about the movie i watched it in one of my graveyard shift i don t recommend that to anyone it s a bit to complicated mysterious for that i still can t believe i didn t see the ending coming i m not gonna say what cause that ll spoil the hole movie although saying this is spoilment enough now i m suppose to cast my vote about this movie i love the dark mystic story the actors did a good job i love the directors natali work in the past there s not a big audience for this kind of thing that s also pretty risky you know what i m just gonna give this work a cause everybody should see this then again point deduction cause there is always space for improvement 
it s actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond as i m sure he wouldn t be able to keep up in the nowadays spying business where fast cars have been replaced with hi tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment cypher is a pretty inventive sci fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible you know the trend in these types of movies nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again the events in cypher supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world where the major companies don t really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other s thunder company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor the sunways corporation sunways on the other hand constantly tries to unmask the digisoft rats and recruit them again as double spies in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan a seemingly colorless thirty something employee who s been selected by sebastian rooks the ber spy to diddle the secret policies of both companies trust me it s actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali the dude from tube carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem seconds starring rock hudson as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that s film with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless there s also plenty of great action and suspense most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing techniques during boring conventions the middle section of the film drags a little mainly because you already realize that it s all just building up towards multiple misleading plot twists and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not so distant future jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side regular director s choice david hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric suways engineer virgil c dunn cypher is well made and adrenalin rushing sci fi entertainment highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time 
this movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named digicorp this wimpy guy morgan jeremy northam is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy he is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies plans instead morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman played by lucy liu and pretty much being double crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent how will morgan get himself out of this can he trust the beautiful but mysterious rita foster played by lucy liu and more importantly can morgan make it out alive wow what a nifty movie i was completely sucked in after minutes of watching this movie it is very suspenseful and you can feel morgan s fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive the scene where they put this horrible contraption on morgan s head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished from a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses he turns into a man actively fighting for his life the ending wow the ending is incredible the twist is so much fun it left me gasping and cheering like crazy good performances from all around especially from jeremy natham lucy liu and nigel bennett i highly recommend this film 
although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built or bought to your specifications it is not the first nor the last in jack benny and ann sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy george washington slept here by george s kaufman and moss hart and about fifteen years ago shelly long and tom hanks had the lead in the money pit the former was about moving into an th century country house that err needs work the latter was about building your dream house in the late s although the two films have their moments both are not as good as blandings which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name jim blandings and his wife muriel cary grant and myrna loy are noticing the tight corners of their apartment which they share with their two daughters joan and betsy sharyn moffett and connie marshall although blandings has a good income as an advertising executive in he is making a year which was like making today and lives in a luxury apartment which in the new york city of that day he rents he feels they should seek something better he and muriel take a drive into the country connecticut and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want and they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to for one thing they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise if cynical friend and lawyer bill cole melvin douglas in a nicely sardonic role for example jim buys land from a connecticut dealer ian wolfe sucking his chops quietly with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of connecticut bill points out he s paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth there are problems about water supply that both blandings just never think about such as hard and soft water which leads to the zis zis water softening machine they find that the designs they have in mind and have worked out with their architect reginald denny can t be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for the escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils jim he has been appointed to handle the wham account spam had become a popular result of world war ii in that the public started using it as a meat substitute in the light of it s success with the armed forces jim can t get a grip on this he s not alone one or two other executives fumbled it before him he comes up with the following bit of poetry this little piggy went to market he was pink and as pretty as ham he smiled in his tracks as they gave him the ax he knew he would end up as wham his secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of bill to muriel although in this case bill is blameless but he s always around jim keeps forgetting that bill is the clearheaded one and that he s keeping jim and muriel from making so many mistakes all three have mishaps the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house just as the men have left for the day they can t open the door and jim in a panic tries breaking the door down by a make shift battering ram he breaks a window and the door opens by itself the film works quite satisfactorily with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves it is one film which despite changing price levels and salary levels really does not age at all after all most americans dream of owning their own home and always have a number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with myrna loy and emory parnell regarding the paint job parnell s company has to do on the various rooms she carefully shows the distinct shades of red blue etc she wants even giving a polite parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue the commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job they proudly called loy mrs blandings in the commercials introduction you can imagine though how the no nonsense parnell handles the situation afterward when loy leaves him with his paint crew 
canadian director vincenzo natali took the art house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube which is my personal favourite sf film of the s it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube shot entirely on one set and took this idea in fascinating directions i ve been eagerly awaiting natali s follow up and although its taken five years for him to mount another project i m delighted to say it was worth the wait cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man s place in the world and how through a completely logical chain of events finds himself in a situation beyond his control i don t want to reveal too much about the plot because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it s head cypher is such a film morgan sullivan jeremy northam one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet is hired by the company digicorp they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars to his bewilderment they are unbelievably boring covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese while morgan is waiting for one seminar he runs into rita foster an impeccably cast lucy liu the definition of an ice maiden she gives him the brush off but there is something to her he finds irresistible that s not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in when rita turns up at another one of morgan s seminars she tells him his life is not what it appears and i m not saying anything more about the plot to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us as well as the tortuous path that s so much fun to follow as with cube natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people taking them out of the familiar and basically seeing what will happen when they re thrust into the unknown and cypher follows similar patterns but it s not a carbon copy of cube it has it s own inspiration cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle it s as much of a shock to us as it is to him one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns cypher is also on a low budget but natali economises it as much as he can allowing him to broaden the horizon and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity natali s direction is exceptional with a deft hand on the reins there are some amazing camera angles from above such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film noir the acting is uniformly excellent throughout jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity his performance is excellent because it s so modulated he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes from a clinical spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black his scene is one of the best because it s an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia he is a supposed expert in identifying double agents and it s a fantastic piece of writing brilliantly acted by hewlett all he has to do is look at morgan and we re drawn into his complex mind game but it s lucy liu who s the scene stealer here too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect but in cypher she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove rita is an aloof guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone things come to a very gratifying end that doesn t conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did but morgan deserves his happy ending after he s been put through the ringer like this i cheered for him in the final scene it s a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy minutes cypher succeeds on all counts engaging shocking always entertaining it s everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn t and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix a fine follow up from natali and now i m a committed fan of the man superb stuff 
listen i don t care what anybody says as cypher is nothing less than a star movie cypher is not i repeat not a b movie cypher is an absolute masterpiece suffice it to say i am a connoisseur of the world s finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight i cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made the technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime in fact i must admit that cypher completely surprised the hell out of me in fact i ve recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie other critics of whom some downplayed the movie have no idea as to what the hell they re talking about don t listen to the haters and actually for the most part reviews of cypher have been largely positive and it should be noted that cyher is not only a good movie but it is also a fantastic movie cypher is the kind of movie that s so advanced and so magnificently crafted that it s over the heads of most critics and all the cynics there is nothing wrong with or cheap about cypher whatsoever again the cinematography the backdrops the technology the storyline and the acting are all world class top notch naturally i won t give anything away this is not a spoiler and though it is the contention of some critics that cypher should have been in movie theaters i believe quite the opposite cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for dvd release only and not in a bad way cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves blade runner brave new world total recall logan s run jason bourne and impostor and deja vu look out cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the aonn multimedia research star eternal spy movie hall of fame cypher is counterespionage at it s absolute best hands down and hats off nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction the future is now 
this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen the film is superbly shot i love the cinematography in this it feels fresh and original plot wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci fi stuff morgan sullivan jeremy northam is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp a large technological corporation he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife after his first job things become strange his habits change his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu he takes an instant attraction to however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies sullivan whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain dead day dream while the speakers drone on the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it they now effectively control what these spies do except for sullivan when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp make sullivan a double agent they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him when a mysterious third party becomes involved the person it is revealed that foster works for sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires the cast are great northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent he brings a great visual aspect to his performance his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact the rest of the cast are also good director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci fi flick cube has a real visual flair he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn t great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci fi films it is up there with them the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states 
jeremy northam s characterization of the stuttering mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu s presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face neck and lips no matter the brainwashing love has a way of persevering love also cannot be brainwashed in with either of his two fake wives in gradual stages he begins to dispense with his glasses to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses the music is fantastic hypnotic sexy and appropriately driving at times the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi film noir in the tradition of many classic thrillers i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu s portrayal whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part she is just no match for northam s talents but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author 
you ll notice by the stars i ve given this great film that before you see it the first time is implied i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week and last was a very slow rental experience not much great coming in i m not sure how this movie slipped past me i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too still it did this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don t have a large budget it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark just enough the entire film is you the viewer trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns i would have given this film however some of the shots were pretty fake looking i don t hold that against this film too much but i don t think it deserves a perfect score lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious as always i think she s pretty underrated as a serious talent nevermind her beauty which is difficult she really takes her roles seriously and doesn t rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed as well jeremy northam does really well at first as quite a geeky corporate rat willing to run through any maze to prove himself however as he changes throughout the film it s like night and day i know some fans of clive owen jude law or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this but northam would could should fit that bill he s suave and cultured he s got a great bond posture and voice i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it and rather down to earth as well great film and definitely this movie buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films 
there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective close ups it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers this film also included one of the most imaginative escape scenes in recent years the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller although the plotting of the film was convoluted the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed in george orwell suggested in his famous novel that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state which would control minds and diminish human liberty it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film it was not the state but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker 
 having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of new york city jim blandings cary grant finds a property in the country for his wife and children he s hoping to find the simple life but building a house proves to be anything but simple as the headaches and the bills start piling up so do the laughs will mr blanding s ever get his dream house what makes this movie so special is the three main actors grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own so when you combine their talents almost every scene is special grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role he is so good at playing the put upon husband loy is a always a joy to watch the thin man films she made with william powell are near perfect and douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years douglas also appeared in the old dark house a particular favorite of mine the movie is definitely a product of its time i get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two story three bedroom four bathroom house on income a year throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live in maid and it becomes almost fanciful however for anyone who has bought or built a house many of the situations and predicaments the blanding s find themselves in are easily relatable to today and that s where the comedy comes in how many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected the biggest complaint i have about mr blandings is the whole wife in love with best friend subplot it s really not necessary to the plot and feels out of place and very uncomfortable as presented

i enjoyed watching cliffhanger at the beginning when that woman sarah was full of terror when she was slipping i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster i did like watching cliffhanger i think silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think he ll be known as playing rambo and rocky 
this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle stallone is gabe walker cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie stallone needed this role to get back on track snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow ice cold and bad weather than finnish man action is good music in the film is spectacular the bad guy is john litghow other stars micheal rooker the portrait of serialkiller janine turner strong medicine the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie overall good movie remember extreme li t special collectors edition with good extras comig soon in finland straight to video 
this movie is really nerve racking cliffhangin movie stallone was good as always michael rooker put on a surprising performance and john lithgow play a excellent villain the music is fantastic especially the theme the movie is action packed and never dull if you are a stallone fan then watch cliffhanger you won t be disappointed 
cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone s last action movie before he became such an underrated actor it s about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over million dollars it has great action sequence s edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies

after the success of die hard and it s sequels it s no surprise really that in the s a glut of die hard on a movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallone s career cliffhanger is one big nit pickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing base jumping aviation facial expressions acting skills all in all it s full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk stallone even managed to get out acted by a horse however if you an forget all the nonsense it s actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughs you ve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless turncoat agent rex linn as travers he may of been henry in portrait of a serial killer but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe worthy performance as hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors that man never hurt anybody and whilst he surely can t be it really does look like ralph waite s frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death mention too must go to former london s burning actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football yes you can t help enjoy that bit hal needed a good kicking so forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if you re looking for qaulen he s the one wearing the helicopter 
forget credibility you must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons especially when renny harlin is directing cliffhanger is no exception but the movie has numerous assets breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed stunning special and visual effects the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film excellent musical score welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension and a solid cast two heroes stallone star and cowriter has the lion s share of the footage but the excellent michael rooker more than stands his ground a charming heroin janine turner and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever priceless john lithgow and deceivingly feminine caroline goodall but also rex linn in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it leon craig fairbrass good solid entertainment then if no credibility as roger ebert wrote about another film it s the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don t make the mistake of thinking too much 
was this based on a comic book a video game a drawing by a year old there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all not the characters not the dialog not the plot not the action nothing we have high tech international terrorists criminals who bicker like pre school kids stallone s man of steel type resilience towards ice cold weather dialog so dumb that it s sometimes almost hilarious and so on even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb tango tango a film that entertains through some suspense good action sequences and a nice snowy mountainous setting oh yes and the unintentional humour the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a swell time then comes a sweat inducing failed rescue part which should make anyone with fear of heights problems want to pull their hair out and then we have some more bad dialog and after that some more great action this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell stallone s melodramatic exchange with turner when they meet after a long time is so soapy so clich d so fake and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self respecting viewer soon after this display of awful dialog writing we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane the entire action is one big absurdity but it s mindless fun at its best although the rest of the action is exciting and fun the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film after the landing our master criminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and rooker they send stallone to fetch the first case of money but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it they take most of his clothes off so he can freeze and they won t give him the equipment he needs so he can fall off do these gangsters want their money fetched or not very silly apparently they don t trust stallone but surely they know that they can always black mail him by using rooker as a hostage nevertheless our gangsters make stallone s climb difficult if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are lest there be any doubts and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are they overact brag and snicker in a truly evil manner everyone convinced good you d better be otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal clear to everyone the old guy who flies the chopper how the hell did he fall for the trap firstly he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminals and secondly he must have heard stallone s and rooker s voices on the walkie talkies a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines get off my back lithgow i haven t even started climbing on your back or lithgow to stallone we had a deal but now we only have each other and as for lithgow s gang of murderers these guys never seem to want to kill immediately they are very creative about it they philosophize pretend that they are playing football with your body and so on stallone co wrote this thing i have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it i d hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i q 
since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite since then i ve seen it countless times and i never get tired of it the setting has a lot to do with it the colorado i know would be jealous but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes there has not been a movie i can compare this too john lithgow plays a smart villain but i love how he is completely out of his element he has to follow tucker around and that s what keeps it interesting this is an action movie at it s best i don t think i ll see another that is so entertaining you don t need rounds fired to qualify as an action movie it just has to keep you captivated not shell shocked 
to be honest i didn t like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time but i guess the trouble is that i haven t seen it in a theater big mistake because the thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and is the cinematography try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level and a commercial potential the more i see it the more i like it it s definitely one of renny harlin s best movie this guy knows about action die hard the long kiss good bye etc and it s particularly good in this movie the special effect are great and spectacular stallone really needed that movie get back with success still good to see him 
sly s best out and out action film it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters solid performances and renny harlins direction is stylishly assured stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the s a definite genre classic as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film the film looks great and there is great support from janine turner michael rooker and john lithgow 
i don t think i ll ever understand the hate for renny harlin die hard was cool and he gave the world cliffhanger one of the most awesome action movies ever that s right you little punks cliffhanger rules and we all know it sly plays gabe walker a former rescue climber who is just visiting his old town when he is asked to help a former friend hal tucker michael rooker assist in a rescue on a mountain peak walker obviously came back at a convenient time because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen john lithgow qualen co have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u s government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back essentially cliffhanger is another die hard clone just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal naturally that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough as stallone s character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease and slams face first into several rock faces with no apparent side effects after all isn t that what action movies are all about cliffhanger is one of the most exciting action movies around a showcase of great scenes and stunts one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i ve ever seen in a movie and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning it maintains its action awesomeness john lithgow s lead villain is entertaining and one bad dude quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever cliffhanger is easily one of stallone s best efforts definitely renny harlin s best effort and a very exciting action movie 
four prisoners share a single cell the domineering transvestite marcus clovis cornillac marcus s idiot savant buddy paquerette dimitri rataud who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches cockroaches and his little sister lassalle philippe laudenbach the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife and carr re g rald laroche the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping after a brick falls from the wall of the cell the men discover the hidden journal written by a fountain of youth obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the s is this journal the secret to their escape or is there something much more sinister behind it i was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience i have with eric valette was the dreadful one missed call which i consider to be the worst theatrically released film i ve ever seen however much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to klavan s awful script because as i remember valette s direction wasn t the worst part about the film unless he chose to include the baby anyway mal fique was a good way to get my respect back it s a french film obviously something i like and it takes place in prison which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums so that s two points for him before the film even starts luckily valette had me once the film ended as well mal fique is a rather deep rather complex rather compelling story of obsession and desperation the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality while it s not a terrifying film in the traditional sense the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening the period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film i ve seen in quite some time and i would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore final verdict quite a bit of respect earned back by valette note paramount picked up the rights to make an american remake surprise surprise it s due out in i m not sure why to be honest as this doesn t seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states but i ve been surprised before vive la france ap 
now i know french inmates are unlikely to have read lovecraft and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school maybe as a separate subject but how did they think something that sounds like ftagn yog sototh could possibly lead to any good the movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may if read right get them out as prisons go the cell was totally unrealistic so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things it also moves rather slowly which may bore people but other than that this is top notch horror feeling mixing sartre s hell is other people with a lovecraft barker type of story and doing rather successfully bottom line take the time to watch this that means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else this is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it lessons to be learned yog is bad almost as bad as french women 
i was hooked from beginning to end great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump but to make you go what the f ck did i just see all the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about so i won t rehash what has already been said i was telling other people about this movie days after i had seen it just because it still haunted me i even had a bad dream after seeing it and i am a true horror fan not easily spooked by tripe like the grudge or even silent hill what gave me the bad dreams was the unease i felt about what i would do if i were in that cell with those guys what would my personal horror be my subconscious took me there and it was not pleasant that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you the best part of this movie is that it is subtle it s not about bogeymen that jump out at you alien invasions or tons of gore it s the opposite the horror you create in your own mind the irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it s power over them simply the men ask for the one thing they desire and they get it but not in the way they imagined so on the one hand they get what they wish for from an occult book but may ultimately wish they hadn t sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be 
this film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film the plot is somewhat lacking but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference this is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please as a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining and with major stars like cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas how could you go wrong comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued and is very difficult to imitate a good example of this is seen in the knockoff of this film the money pit with tom hanks and shelley long despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments achieving true comedic dialog is an art 
the film opens with bill coles melvyn douglas telling a story about how his best friend make that client jim blandings cary grant and his family are tightly packed into a small new york apartment with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms when jim s wife muriel myrna loy wants to renovate the apartment advertising exec jim falls in love with or falls for an ad for a house once he s purchased the house bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of jim s dream house goes wrong one of three collaborations between grant and loy this is a charming little comedy not very taxing with no real great message but a great way to spend an hour or two the laughs are there right from the start when the alarm clock goes off and jim tries to shut it off only to be thwarted at every turn by muriel the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros and that s just what grant and loy give us polished performances simple chemistry and a lot of fun myrna loy is in a pretty thankless role it s evident that grant s character jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting and grant as always pulls both off with remarkable aplomb but she gives muriel a colour life and bite that only myrna loy can give a character melvyn douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well never hitting a single wrong note one of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when bill gets himself locked in the store room and jim goes to save him only to get everyone trapped inside every little problem that pops up for the blandings renovation project including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for wham seems to bring together everything that could go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch 
when i was six yo i learned about a series called los campeones and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch the champions and the avengers once every week i think that was the golden age of english series i already own the complete cycle of the prisoner but lasted also a few years later with the tomorrow people the worst witch i just me or this is harry potter in girl of course before as much as i want the campions to be in zone or zone i m also waiting for dr who pack the whole series in a set of uhm maybe dvd s please i couldn t expend more for it people of tomorrow and several other low budget but great stories to be available within my reached zones i speak and understand english but not all my relatives do including my parents whom introduced me into these great stories i hope someday someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them dubbed or subtitled but in the same format i saw them remember zone or are ok with my tv set 
my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re runs of it one summer in the s we absolutely adored it there was something so exotic and mysterious about it especially when compared to the usual american re runs petticoat junction green acres you get the idea it had a similar feel to the avengers not too much of a surprise since it was also british and in the spy adventure genre i would love to see it again now hopefully it holds up i ve mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it so i began to wonder if i d imagined its whole existence but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it hopefully it will find a new generation of fans 
well what can i say other than these people are super in every way i quite like sharon mcreedy i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of discs episodes i did not realise that they had made so many i also think that it is a great shame that they have not made any more i wish that i got given these powers imagine me being knocked off my cycle somewhere and being knocked out cold then waking up in a special hospital later on i discover that my body has been enhanced just like richard barrat these stories are minutes of pure action and suspense all the way you cannot fight these people as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry the music is well written and to me puts a wonderful picture of super beings in my mind the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats improved sight improved hearing and touch and the strength of men for richard and craig and the strength of women for sharon who i thought was beautiful and intelligent when i was a boy i had a huge crush on her now i can see why on my dvd set the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series i also thought that trymane was a good boss firm but he got things done 
i was years old when this show was on tv by far it was my favorite the actors were very credible alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous i just order the dvd episodes they didn t have super powers they just had superior human skills strength hearing sight the actors were very good in their rolls very believable there was a good story in each episode at the time there were no special effects or explosions everywhere so the script was suppose to be good and the characters performs were great there was no fancy stuff like in other shows they didn t try to make a joke every minutes to make a light show i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff 
i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy i have ever seen it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation the thought that maybe they won t get together it is an indie film after all this movie was well written directed and acted the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent 
the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly s i ll take you there is not overt but clearly has ties to his work shelly has acted in two of hartley s films not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative but the hyper stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light though this film is not ironic on the whole thank god the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies i ll see you there is a great indie film that doesn t stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion the film begins with bill s life falling to pieces not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat all washed up bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy played by the director adrienne shelly brings him all kinds of surprises a self help book and a date for her traumatized brother the unwilling bill tries to refuse but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice no doubt bernice s initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to rebound with her however her pseudo hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him forcing herself upon him to what end we are not aware except for maybe the fact that she is psycho and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy aware that bill desperately wants to see rose bernice offers her car but on the condition that he take her somewhere first on the way she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun a pinkerton detective no less an imbroglio of angst resentment redemption passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose of course with a few stops along the way 
real cool smart movie i loved sheedy s colors especially the purple car alice drummond is wise and wonderful as stella i liked sheedy s reference to how her face had gotten fatter the roadside dance scene is brilliant really liked this one 
 ah ritchie s made another gangster film with statham thought the average fan expecting another snatch lock stock expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts but none too hard for me and the lads to swallow after a few beers ah pay attention you do need to watch this film no cups of tea no extra diet cokes from the counter no keep it running shouts as you nip to the fridge watch the film no laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence and if that floats your boat so be it but sharp solid direction excellent dialogue and great performances my favourite big pussy from the sopranos always a reliable hood 
if you are a fan of altman s large ensemble casts as evidenced in major films like m a s h nashville gosford park and lesser seen films like a wedding then you will no doubt be entertained by health centered around a health convention where two women are running for president health contains many of altman s latter s regulars like paul dooley who helped write the film carol burnett and henry gibson while also including top star altman newcomers like lauren bacall james garner and glenda jackson like a lot of altman ensemble films there are numerous subplots in this film but it is not nearly as overwhelming as films like nashville or a wedding rather it has a more centered feel perhaps like m a s h or gosford park the whole thing is an obvious satire on the health movement filled with over top outlandish contradictive characters with guest stars like dick cavett providing a wry commentary on the whole thing underlining the whole election process is altman s characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun most people seem to be having this would be one of altman s last films like this for a while 
i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art i was very surprised to see the overall rating as not only does guy bring together a b list ish movie cast and make them into such glorious characters he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable this film is special get it now 
it s all very simple jake goes to prison and spends five years with the con and the chess masters they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks they decide to give jake the ultimate freedom from his innermost fears from what he believes to be himself for that they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear all the pride all the hope to be reborn as true master of his will it s a clever movie about the journey of illumination about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves no doubt 
i will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone the fact is it wasn t what anyone was expecting especially from guy ritchie what everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners do ya like dags etc but this is far more mature than his previous works i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder this film demands all your attention look past the cool and dazzling look of the film try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film yes this has its influences from modern classics fight club pulp fiction etc but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney masterpieces 
i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think and don t just drip feed the answers to their audience revolver is one of these films and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it first time true it doesn t compare to other mind mucks like the usual suspects or memento but in its own right its an intelligent and thought provoking film another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is every scene every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages if you see it you ll know what i mean so to conclude watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it if not well no one ever said revolver is for everyone and that s my cents 
in the classic sense of the four humors which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment altman s h e a l t h treats all of the humors and actually in very funny entertaining ways there s the phlegm as personified by lauren bacall s very slow guarded and protective character esther brill who s mission in life appears to be all about appearance protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well being there s paul dooley s choleric dr gil gainey who like a fish out of water perhaps more like a seal flops around frenetically barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness the melancholy of glenda jackson s isabella garnell smacks of shakespeare s troubled and self righteous hamlet even proffering a soliloquy or two and let s not forget henry gibson s bile character bobby hammer the breast that feeds the baby rules the world then there s the characters harry wolff and gloria burbank james garner and carol burnett respectively relatively sane characters striving to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humors who have convened for h e a l t h a kind of world trade organization specializing in h e a l t h which is to say anything but health this is altman at his classic best 
first of all when people hear guy ritchie they immediately think of snatch yes snatch was a good movie but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch they don t expect him to explore new frontiers this movie revolver is different than snatch it s much darker and is very complex the reason i gave a rating of is because i ve had to watch revolver times to understand everything so this movie toys with your head it s very cleverly written this movie is different than snatch it was done wonderfully the cinematography is beautiful and you can recognize guy ritchie s personal touch style of directing in it what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers 
i watched this movie when i was almost quite a kid and naturally was moved to tears by this story of a fox family the fantastic scenery at hokkaid the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists i am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack to german viewers it might be useful to know that the defa dubbing is the only one worth listening to i taped both defa and br but i keep viewing the first one only 
i have been looking for this movie for so many years i saw this move when i was nine and loved this movie i called disney all the movie stores and the net no luck what a waste it was a very good movie it will be missed 
i saw this movie when i was little it was called glacier fox i was totally traumatized by it it follows a cute little fox family around the beginning was great and i remember becoming very attached to the little foxes i also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while i was in hysterics i won t tell you what happened but let s just say it doesn t end well for all of the foxes i was used to disney type nature films where the animals don t really die oh man this movie made me cry for hours it was a good movie i think i was really little and truth be told all i remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die rent it if you can but don t show your kids 
i recommend families if possible to show this to older children only some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle now that thats out of the way let me explain about this movie this is in reality a documentary of a male fox who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate the beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score is breath taking you had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible it ll get ugly later they gave both the fox and the vixen names but i can t remember what they are for the likes of me he fights off this invading male to win her love they later on create a den and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs one of which is blind there are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon the first victim is the blind pup who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away the second victim is the mother who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole she unknowingly walks into a foot trap while trying to escape she rips off part of her foot causing her to bleed to death the rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree the male is now a single dad forced to take on the roll of mom and dad he alone has to teach them the skills they need for life it later proves not to be enough when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man i won t spoil the surprising ending for you but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail and it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through i wanted to say that i saw this when it first came out in early s when we had a thing called showbiz cable i was only when i saw it but i could never understand why they wouldn t let me see all of it now i know why after i secretly watched it when it came on disney when i was i felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on i was moved to tears but as dark and ugly as it was it serves a purpose to let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals and why they are endangered this documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species and i hoped it worked its not fake like the true life nature films by disney they don t teach about why animals are going extinct the encroachment of land the killing off of the foxes main prey and senseless killing of these beautiful animals has resulted in them becoming endangered i wish they would make sequel to this movie glacier fox to see if they re being treated better maybe have it be about a vixen pup named teresa and her siblings growing up this movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes especially when one of the parents suddenly dies the surviving parent takes on the roll of both and tries to teach the important lessons of life it isn t always enough to protect them when they re adults especially when some of their lives becomes ruined or they fall victims to tragedy themselves best all around soundtrack and musical score i ve ever heard 
the villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing that is what i guess makes him so mean i don t think most men will like this movie especially if they ever cheated on their wife this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end but then there you have it a candy bar ending that makes me look back and say hokie as hell a pretty good movie until the end ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning and then there is the aftermath of what happened guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending i m left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end 
some of the acknowledged altman masterpieces seem sadder to me now maybe it s me like the last reviewer i even like this lesser altman shown recently on fmc although i don t think he was aiming at a wide audience organization politics as a microcosm for public campaigns some of this satirical docudrama is now dated like dick cavett watching the tonight show but i found much of the dialog funny and insightful e g you are for real that means you re no threat to anyone the story isn t profound but i liked it and the performances are funny especially cavett as himself lauren bacall as an aging conservative figurehead glenda jackson who actually became a member of parliament as a left wing ideologue in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics and carol burnett as a basket case all in the inimitable altman style although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual but pretty inimitable 
life s going not to badly for harry mitchell he s an ex air force major plus nifty little pension i imagine who s raking in the cash for a patent he s developed fusing titanium and steel via explosive process creating super metal fit for nasa and his wife of twenty odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick he s got a nice little pad in la i like to see visions of the s consumer dream and you get a good slice here what with the restored silver jag a series e type roadster for him and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her as well as i m sure other trinkets and boys toys there s always got to be more though hasn t there so harry let s himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans you re only as old as the woman you re feeling as in many films noir one mistake in an otherwise blotch less life leads to a downwards arc for harry three blackmailers leech onto him these are where the value are for me great character actors playing very believable roles bobby shy played by clarence williams iii is a black ex con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double crossers he s reminiscent of pluto the vicious black ex con psychopath from carl franklin s well regarded neo noir one false move there s a similar character motivation i believe both men have had enough of the man and well pretty much everyone in extremis robert trebor plays leo franks a fat lily livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at for half an hour and for a whole hour did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount he s in over his head and it s great to watch trebor acting when leo starts to feel the heat believable breakdown john glover wins as alan raimy who is the brains of the plot an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui he s a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie including what i believe is a pretty well implied rape pay attention to his rap sheet readout it s easily missed and read between the lines for the motel scene with slim in common with one false move though not exclusively i think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence so far so good but i think there s a real problem with the film harry mitchell is told at one point that he has his tit in the wringer my problem is that harry mitchell is played by roy scheider roy scheider protagonists never lose they re self sure and smooth but not in an annoying way i feel i m being asked to believe that his character is in peril the movie relies on this for dramatic tension however i didn t believe it for me it s like being asked to believe that sandra bullock s character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama or stephen seagal s character is going to get taken down by the baddies did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value roy scheider doesn t convince as an adulterer either you don t feel any annoyance with him at all his character is teflon coated it also felt like a movie that took some cuts at minutes it still feels underdeveloped harry s wife ann margaret is pretty much a cardboard cutout an extension of harry her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention the effect that the affair has on harry s marriage isn t properly communicated this could be a frankenheimer problem he s not known for character development i never felt that harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the irs there is good sleazy violent noir content in this film but i feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of harry could have been done better no disrespect to the great roy scheider the film felt short even with the long running time and i think could have taken some more fleshing out but you really can t forget the sleaze like the deliciously pervy scene of harry taking photos of doreen in the nudie parlour 
 pick up never got the respect it should have it works on many levels and has a complicated but followable plot the actors involved give some of their finest performances ann margret roy scheider and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals notable too are vanity who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows and kelly preston who s character will haunt you for a few days anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this 
this is a great small film i say small because it doesn t have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions as in a john woo film great performances by roy scheider and the three bad guys john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days the film is very easy to watch the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine instead of everything going around and around it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens wonderful ending very positive i never read the elmore leonard book but it can t be much different from the film because it feels like i m watching an elmore leonard movie 
this slick and gritty film consistently delivers it s one of frankenheimer s best and most underrated films and it s easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date and if you are scratching your head thinking but i loved get shorty you need to be punched in the face in my opinion no one captures the feel for leonard s characters better then john glover in pick up the relocation of the story from detroit novel to hollywood film elevates the story s sleaze factor to amazing heights be a man have a few beers and watch this movie for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are swag rum punch cat chaser city primeval and pick up my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate i also have a real special place in my cold movie heart for dead bang and black sunday 
spoilers from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the news i wanted to see it i don t remember who it was or which local omaha newscast carried the review but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church going nebraskan they showed a snippet from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann margret when she s swimming in the pool glover s character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out i was hooked there was one problem though i was only years old at the time and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable let s just say it was worth the wait if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine this movie is it to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement the film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman roy scheider who is as effective as ever plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains john glover s character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time he s sleazy funny at times and always on the brink of doing something crazy then there s robert trebor s nice name by the way character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme he is a whimpering sweating coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models then you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason who could forget the wake up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear after dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he s up against scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation that is until glover goes after his wife the conflict is played out brutally with virtually the entire cast getting shot raped or blown up i don t know why i love this movie so much it really should creep me out but it doesn t maybe it s because these characters are all interesting and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try it s scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like glover s running around out in l a looking for trouble just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle hey sport have a nice day this film has plenty of shootouts cool cars great dialog like the line in my opening statement and decent acting plenty of cameos by real life porno stars look for ron jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at glover s place another thing i must add how hot are the women in this film wow travolta did right by marrying kelly preston yum we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian and ann margret what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty of stars so sayeth the hound added feb rip roy scheider 
chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos unfaltering performances rock solid writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever all of the cast are strong but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy s anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james gandolfini is absolutely fierce absolutely terrifying and you still find yourself loving him mesmerized by him many people that i ve spoken to about the sopranos who haven t seen it yet will say i m just not a fan of mafia movies shows whatever run don t walk and get it those same people usually love e r but i bet they don t much care for hospitals it s not about the context 
this is the definite lars von trier movie my favorite i rank it higher than breaking the waves or the latest dancer in the dark i simply love the beauty of the picture the framing is so original acting is wonderful a must see 
the sopranos was probably the last best show to air in the s its sad that its over its was the best show on hbo if not on tv not everything was spelled out for you throughout you had to think it was brilliant the cast was excellent tony james gandolphini is a great actor and played his character excellent as well as the others each character had flaws thats what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and thats one reason it lasted so long the last episode was good i m not sure how to take it many different things can be construed by the ending id like to think that tony didn t die but meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead thats how i feel long live the sopranos and tony soprano 
now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i m appalled for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i m afraid i don t know what the world has come to let me tell u something i started watching many t v shows like lost prison break dexter deadwood and even invasion but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season then we have the sopranos i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season and more importantly all of its episodes there is no department that this show doesn t excel in acting nothing short of superb james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would ve been the better choice however after watching the first few episodes i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony the raw emotion he displays is superb then we have everyone else edie falco michael imperioli lorraine bracco dominic chianese whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie walnuts gualtieri and silvio dante all of these actors perform to the best quality and all giving an excellent performance in each episode then we have the story never have i been so sucked into a t v show before the story is nothing short of excellent each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show not just say its too violent or they feel that the character of tony is immoral i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day i don t think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me you ll be hooked from the very first episode i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show hooked on it trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t v after you ve watched the first season you ll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television and no t v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos 
 the godfather of television but aside from it s acclaim and mobster characters the two are nothing alike tony soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks his psychiatrist learns that tony is actually part of two families in one family he is a loving father yet not so perfect husband and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy after analysis dr melfi concludes that tony s problems actually derive from his mother livia who s suspected to have borderline personality disorder gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character yet bracco and marchand aren t nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother respectively falco imperioli and dematteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles van zandt from the e street band plays his first and only role as tony s best friend and is quite convincing and latching chianese the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a godfather film plays tony s uncle and on and off nemesis many fans also enjoyed characters played by pastore ventimiglia curatola proval pantoliano lip sciorra and buscemi tony s children are okay but not notable with the exception of iler s stunning performance in the third to last episode the second coming sirico and schirripa are unconvincing and over the top but the show is too strong for them to hold it back even as the show continues for over six season it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment out of four 
the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever so naturally my expectations were through the roof and yet the show surpassed them i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds but this is so much more hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia action stories but also to be a great family drama a shocking character study a laugh out loud comedy a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one david chase s epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more and cements hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away realism is present when it is needed but chase s decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for dream episodes and the like only adds more layers to the series chase along with a strong writing staff including matthew weiner and terrence winter future creators of mad men and boardwalk empire respectively turns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i ve seen on tv james gandolfini domineers the show as tony one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture but he defies the other half entirely and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr melfi lorraine bracco with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expect edie falco matches the power of gandolfini s performance as tony s wife carmela from her mixed feelings about tony s lifestyle to her suspicions about murders to her torment over tony s cheating to her own thoughts about infidelity carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout seasons and falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world scenes between tony and carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television the supporting cast is almost as phenomenal and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons somehow without any redundancies nancy marchand steals the show as tony s overbearing mother livia an insight into tony s personality problems and panic attacks the familiarity of marchand s incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far michael imperioli is christopher tony s prot g whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed drea de matteo plays christopher s girlfriend adriana and is so well meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with christopher s career tony sirico is paulie introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show and nobody plays true anger better than he and that s just the tip of the iceberg familiar faces such as peter bogdanovich jon favreau ben kingsley lauren bacall will arnett nancy sinatra david strathairn robert patrick hal holbrook burt young and eric mangini make appearances over the course of the show while names as notable as joe pantoliano steve buscemi and steven van zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series there are great characters with powerful arcs and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered the sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series i have seen overall and its highs are so mindblowing that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows most of which i disagree with whether you love or hate the ending or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show so if you re thinking of watching something else instead do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit 
the sopranos is perhaps the most mind opening series you could possibly ever want to watch it s smart it s quirky it s funny and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can t resist watching the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families for most of the time you really don t know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back or buy them lunch further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities these are dangerous men most of them murderers but by god if you don t love them too i ve laughed at their wisecracks been torn when they ve made err in judgement and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show s subtext people aren t always as they seem and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds if you haven t already you most definitely should 
take a pinch of goodfellas mix it with the godfather add some roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy and you have the sopranos about a mob clan operating out of northern new jersey it s almost as entertaining as pro wrestling i am not the biggest fan of this show but i do admire james gandolfini s very complicated tony soprano a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience i also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel voiced dom chianese as the bewildered but murderous uncle junior silver haired tony sirico as the perpetually perplexed paulie and the very beautiful edie falco as the duplicitous tough as nails carmela soprano the violence is sudden and graphic the body count steadily climbs each season but it is often the small moments that matter most here watch paulie and tony s nephew christopher michael imperioli late of law order as they get lost in the pine barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck both convinced they ve had it 
i ve only watched the first series on dvd but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino like script the series is as good as goodfellas and casino and almost as good as the godfather hence not a and far better than any of guy ritchie s efforts although there s plenty of action some of it pretty bloody the story is character driven even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines e g the priest s relationship or lack of with carmilla and the restaurateur s wife and christopher and his dimwit friend who didn t last very long a darwin award nominee apart from the plot the script and the acting the other reasons i liked it it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce the music it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems 
i believe that the sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released in all episodes so far the best one is definitely episode denial anger acceptance this episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in the sopranos his name was brendan filone he was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against tony and his gang in the end he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath and that s my most favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos brendan filone is for me and my most favorite character ever was matthew bevilaqua who was killed after attempting to murder christopher moltisanti tony and pussy shoot him in hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him my most favorite character is sean gismonte who was killed right after shooting christopher and finally my most favorite character is chucky signore one of uncle junior s henchmen he was killed on a boat by tony all the awesome characters are dead that s the only bad thing about the sopranos all the cool guys always get killed you know what would be great to change about the sopranos they should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture chris tony uncle junior silvio and paulie because they need to get their revenge brendan filone shall strike back 
not only do the storylines in the sopranos engage audiences from all over but i think for me at least what brings the viewers back is the acting not even you gary can dispute that claim james gandolfini who plays the lead man tony soprano has become in this viewer s opinion one of the hollywood elites as far as acting in a television series goes i wouldn t go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino or at least not just yet he however does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano in the years since gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos that today he is considered to be among the best in the business and it s not just him the sopranos fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco edie falco michael imperioli dominic chianese and the late nancy marchand who played tony s dreadful mother at this point in the show s existence it s being considered a cult classic and rightfully so the first two seasons were extraordinary violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner but without a doubt extraordinarily done the third season was great but didn t quite live up to the hype of seasons and season which wrapped up right before new years was the weakest season yet or at least in my opinion it was despite a dry spell i still found it season of the sopranos to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that s saying a lot because lately i ve been noticing a trend in good new television shows examples of this six feet under the shield curb your enthusiasm and oz which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year to get back to my point though to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year no less is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers the sopranos ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit to close i d like to say the sopranos is the real deal folks for the average mature viewer and above who enjoys drama and doesn t mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity you might want to check out the sopranos if you get the chance trust me in that it will be well worth the time 
there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building each character unfolds more and more each series also each series has an array of different small time characters as well as the main a good example of a character who was only in three episodes who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick every little detail builds the perfect tv series the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano james gandolfini who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable whilst tony runs things with capos paulie tony sirico and silvio steve van zant his nephew christopher michael imperioli looks for a promotion every episode also features tony s other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano edie falco on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano dominic chianese is trying to get what he can out of tony s businesses despite being under house arrest all the acting is powerful and characters complex but the two who stand out the most are james gandolfini who is tony soprano also michael imperioli who plays christopher representing the younger generation in crime if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed such as the wire and dexter so the sopranos is definitely the godfather goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv
this is not so bad that it is good it is purely good for those who don t understand why you have the intellect of a four year old in response to a certain comment anyways killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself a parody of you and a parody of me it is the single most genius text in cinematic history i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard i write scripts and this movie single handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me the likes of which we have never seen it can only be taken in portions its sort of exploitive by now i m just trying to take up the ten line minimum my comment ended a while ago hopefully it works when i submit it now 
wow i loved the whole series and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons while remaining better than anything else on television but and particularly b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons b started with such a sombre mood and janice s always keen insight into the family angst that doom filled line about knowing tony s penchant for sitting and staring anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know tony melfi s discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath s self deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series say with tony s panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with phil s wave bye bye line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode not to get into chase s dark humour i could go on and on but i ll just add that i thought the final show starting with the opening strains of vanilla fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow you keep me hangin on to the terminal moments where tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like aj s suv or phil s head were utterly utterly perfect the best tv ever pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the jack off fantasies aj derides and then into which he promptly subsides a tip of the pork pie to mr chase 
what can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude the sopranos has literally redefined television as we know it it has broken all rules and set new standards for television excellence everything is flawless the writing directing and for me most of all the acting watching this show you ll find yourself realizing that these characters are not real the acting tricks you into thinking there is a real tony soprano or any character this show is also very versatile some people don t watch the show because it s violent it s not all about the violence it s about business family and many deeper things that all depend on what you as a fan see for me i don t like when people refer to the show a show about the mafia for me it s a show about family a family who through generations happen to be apart of the mob overall this is a masterpiece of a show this is what television should be right here complex characters from stunning acting magnificent story lines from brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together a show that defines excellence and dares to be different 
the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television history its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence sublime writing or first rate performances across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality centering around the life of one tony soprano a man who lives in two families one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group of which he is the boss of both played by james gandolfini of true romance and the mexican fame tony is a fascinating scary but also likable guy full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tony the cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever the true genius of this tale however is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series twenty minute long dream sequences powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love honour and respect for family the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous with tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as america s most original and compelling drama forget family redifined this is television redifined 
i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x of course at that time x meant maturity since i was only two years old at the time of the movie s release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then however when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality loneliness physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release it is worth noting that in the s midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r some of the scenes could almost be rated pg by today s standards i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy con man named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager once again joe is conned and before long is homeless however joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment without giving away much more of the plot i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams i e joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health i want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is excellent especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes in fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny i find them amusing for example there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey i m walkin here i m walkin here i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named o daniel what is amusing is that at first we think o daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o daniel is nothing but a religious nut in addition to the two scenes i mentioned i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in self defense john wayne you gonna tell me he s a fag what i like is the delivery in that scene i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late s much of it rings true today that s because although the area around nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was years ago also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character one thing that impresses me about jon voight s character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffman s character was a good influence on him in conclusion i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on for example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings also what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon voight s character and the people who were in his life in texas even the ending while i don t want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather open ended 
first i would like to say how great this it is astounding and sometimes shocking and to say the least i m years old and this is my favorite movie i can definitely stand a boring film but this is anything but boring it is like a trip through humanity its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers voight and hoffman who build a mutual friendship joe buck voight a naive texan stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women soon he meets rico ratso rizzo hoffman who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent ratso becomes joe s manager but soon both men can t find joe a job which results in stealing food as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is they can t get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a ratso s dream spot florida the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life 
jon voight is brilliant in midnight cowboy but hoffman s performance though reminiscent of his later turn in rainman is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies as a portrayal of a new york character only daniel day lewis portrayal of bill butcher in gangs of new york comes to mind as comparable and day doesn t give his character the emotional depth that hoffman gives ratso it s typical of hoffman s way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with midnight cowboy is voight i think hoffman is one of the or best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels voight s buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether except that ratso pulls him down pulls him down but also teaches him a lot about how to survive and more importantly how to live midnight cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself i think that as gritty a movie as it is it has a very beautiful message that no matter how much a loser you might be ratso clearly defines loser if you can find a way to be true to yourself you are in possession of the secret of life and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else i can t help but compare midnight cowboy to klute from a few years later which i think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape 
i was going through a list of oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat butch cassidy and the sundance kid for best picture in after actually seeing it however i m not surprised anymore it was way ahead of its time in regards to its style cinematography and use of flashback to help develop joe buck s character the most amazing thing to me is the depth of joe buck s character in such a short movie i think voight captured the naivete and the viciousness when provoked the two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him i think when he looks in the mirror he s trying to see if it s really him that has done or is about to do something terrible i think it was a brilliant decision by hoffman to take this role otherwise he may have been typecast after the graduate anyway this considered an all time great for a reason 
acidic unremitting and beautiful john schlesinger s masterpiece is no less effective today than years ago when american life was even more disorienting the film probably could not have been made at any other time in history because so many upheavals were taking place in the late s final dissolution of the great american west the intensification of war in vietnam and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety midnight cowboy is widely known as the only academy award winning film to garner an x rating but there is much more behind its fame it also exceeds the norm as a work of art while this film from the novel by james leo herlihy has much to say about the erosion of american life it transcends s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras the two main characters in fact are standard antiheroes men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world the initial focus of midnight cowboy is on year old joe buck a physically imposing texas native played by jon voight in the opening scenes we follow joe s bus trip to new york city where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents the ability to pleasure women and earn his fortune as a hustler we learn upon his arrival that joe is laughably na ve in the sex trade garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as one hell of a stud the young texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with enrico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman a sickly con man and petty thief from the bronx ratso who is short thin and with a limp proves of little monetary help to joe they quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months joe and ratso shiver in a condemned manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names it is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds throughout the film joe hearkens back to earlier years in texas including life with his grandmother sally ruth white who served as guardian his harried relationship with crazy annie jennifer salt a notorious local girl and a traumatic event in which joe and annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair very much of its time midnight cowboy strings together a wild array of flashbacks dream sequences and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds for every moment of understanding we gain from joe and ratso more questions about their lives are generated both men are no doubt in tatters they have no clear sense of direction until ratso falls into the throes of illness and joe finally senses a purpose for being alive this revelation pushes midnight cowboy to its conclusion a rather hopeful one in a very grim story while joe and ratso badly need some luck the direction of john schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of waldo salt s screenplay in allowing voight and hoffman to thrive their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast which features sylvia miles brenda vaccaro and members of the andy warhol clique offers itself as an essential part of the storyline the flashback sequences involving voight ruth white and jennifer salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film thanks to the excellent cinematography of adam holender the boy who could fly smoke and editing by hugh robertson shaft the visuals of midnight cowboy work with its soundtrack assembled by john barry as a cohesive unit sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades the lead song everybody s talking is sung by nilsson which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase the memorable harmonica theme is played by jean toots thielemans midnight cowboy has been released in a two disc collector s edition by mgm ua which contains expanded features and commentary also available is a dvd release used for this review which offers dual widescreen and standard format with dolby digital sound enhancement three language subtitles and closed captioning french dubbing a theatrical re release trailer not the original as advertised and an eight page production booklet both dvd editions contain a th anniversary restored version of the film showing its original brilliance well deserving of its three oscars best picture schlesinger waldo salt and additional nominations voight hoffman sylvia miles hugh robertson midnight cowboy will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics out of 
what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both there really aren t many glimpses of hope in this film for either character but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other this film features jon voight s finest performance and probably dustin hoffman s as well the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film also for those interested andy warhol s apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene if you haven t seen this movie it is essential check it out 
midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in drawing an x rating by today s standards it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating jon voight who has been better is competent in his role as joe buck an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic as ratso dustin hoffman simply shines hoffman has often been brilliant but never more so than in this portrayal he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer worth seeing for hoffman s performance alone 
midnight cowboy is not for everybody it s raw painful and realistic but very entertaining the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances voight as the texas hustler joe buck who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women sadly buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas he was raised by his grandmother sally buck played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in from cancer the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and buck s characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job as the film evolves buck s past comes to the surface and it s haunting but not clear the film is not for children but compared to today s films and television programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i can t forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you can t forget it s also a tearjerker of a film so get your hankies out too 
sandra bernhard is quite a character and certainly one of the funniest women on earth she began as a stand up comedienne in the s but her big break came in when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in scorsese s underrated masterpiece the king of comedy her film career never quite took off though she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures such as dallas doll or dinner rush but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself without you i m nothing is undoubtedly her best effort it s an adaptation of her smash hit off broadway show which made her a superstar and madonna s best friend for about four years in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes sandra turns from nina simone to diana ross talks about her childhood andy warhol and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt bacharach prince or sylvester director john boskovich got sandra to do a minute tour de force performance that s both sexy and uniquely funny if you are a bernhard fan you can t miss out this film it s a tribute as well to her weird beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne and it has influenced filmmakers in their work hedwig and the angry inch for instance would look a lot different if without you i m nothing didn t exist 
 midnight cowboy was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic you know it s a classic the moment its insistent theme song everybody s talking starts up on the soundtrack actually not written for the film and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck naked and in the shower we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he s one helluva stud who s to doubt him this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else his performance here would still be legendary as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish anaconda is a source of pleasure the film became famous and infamous almost overnight it was a crowd pleaser even with its downbeat ending funny and sexy and recognizably real it was the tail end of the sixties and all the characters rang true it was also the first x rated film to win the oscar as the year s best picture adapted brilliantly by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first main stream commercial american movie to deal with taboo subjects such as homosexuality and drug taking in a matter of fact manner everyone is recognizably human warts and all and everyone is treated sympathetically voight s joe buck is an innocent abroad a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy he s a cross between a gigolo and a social worker but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy wormy little con man called ratso rizzo dustin hoffman fresh from the graduate and he s a revelation he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe dream essentially it s a male love story though totally platonic between these two not so unlikely bedfellows both totally alone both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other voight with his physical prowess hoffman with his street wise savvy they are misfits adrift from the mainstream tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others though straight voight isn t beyond a homosexual encounter in a nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself the whole film posits a strangely christian attitude it s also magnificently acted while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangers on beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesinger s direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien s totally detached eye view of the american under belly without rancor and without criticism on second thoughts maybe it is a great movie after all 
after racism rural exodus also known as migration from the country side is another socio political issue of the s westside story had dealt with racism by a love feast in an artistic view now midnight cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view it has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away director john schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts dreams fantasies fears and evaluations of two new york city scums while the handsome joe buck voight dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy the poor ratso rizzo hoffman dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny florida accordingly joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality and ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into florida besides ratso helps joe to find his way to do whatever he can they begin sharing everything in life they share food they share medicine they share an uninhabited home they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny regrettably as the story progresses joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun and moreover ratso cannot see florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there the might is always right and the feeble has no right in the daylight thence midnight gives the factual sight despite the tragedy there is no melodrama in midnight cowboy every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate thanks to this midnight cowboy is a provocative view of a socio political issue the rural exodus 
it s not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered but s midnight cowboy is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time directed by john schlesinger and written by waldo salt the movie seems to be a product of its time the late s when american films were especially expressionistic but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period the film s cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in ang lee s brokeback mountain the meandering plot follows joe buck a naive young texan who decides to move to manhattan to become a stud for hire for rich women full of energy but lacking any savvy he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances he meets a cynical sickly petty thief named ratso rizzo who first sees joe as an easy pawn the two become dependent on one another and rizzo begins to manage joe things come to a head at a psychedelic drug infested party where joe finally lands a paying client meanwhile rizzo becomes sicker and the two set off for florida to seek a better life this is not a story that will appeal to everyone in fact some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic in his first major role jon voight is ideally cast as he brings out joe s paper thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities as rizzo dustin hoffman successfully upends his clean post college image from the graduate and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to joe the honesty of their portrayals is complemented by schlesinger s film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the times square district at the time the director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character s fragile psyches credit also needs to go to salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story the other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters including brenda vaccaro as the woman joe meets at the party sylvia miles as a blowsy matron john mcgiver as a religious zealot and barnard hughes as a lonely out of towner the two disc dvd package contains a pristine print transfer of the restoration and informative commentary from producer jerome hellman since unfortunately neither schlesinger nor salt are still living there are three terrific featurettes on the second disc a look back documentary after midnight reflections on a classic years later which features comments from hellman hoffman voight and others as well as clips and related archive footage such as voight s screen test controversy and acclaim which examines the genesis of the movie s initial x rating and public response to the film and a tribute to the director celebrating schlesinger 
 midnight cowboy was rated x with the original release back in there are some scenes where you can understand that just a little the movie about joe buck jon voight coming from texas to new york city to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler making money by the act of love it does not work out as he planned after a guy named rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends they live in an empty and very filthy apartment then ratso gets sick and joe has to try to make some money the movie was probably rated x for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things the editing in this movie is great we see dream sequences from joe and ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way dustin hoffman jon voight and the supporting actors give great performances especially hoffman delivers some fine famous lines the score is done by john barry and sounds great all this makes this a great movie that won the best picture oscar for a good reason 
i sat down to watch midnight cowboy thinking it would be another overrated s s movie some of my favorite films come from the s in the same vein as midnight cowboy taxi driver mean streets panic in needle park etc but there are many many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking unfortunately a vast majority of them don t hold up as well today i sort of feel this way about easy rider although it too is one of my favorites so i didn t expect much from midnight cowboy but got a lot back it s a touching story well made and well told with some of the best performances of all time dustin hoffman as enrico ratso rizzo gives one of his best it s a bit funny at times he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks maybe because of the lenny simpsons connection but hoffman is entirely convincing half of the film s budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in hollywood opposite him is the second billed jon voight as joe buck the cowboy who travels north to the big apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named ratso who offers to become joe s manager for a certain percentage of profits the movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long some films can tend to drag especially some of the films that were made in the s because as it s been said in easy riders raging bulls the directors were the stars of the movies in the s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material going on too long examining characters scenes etc that aren t important just about the only scene i felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party it makes the film seem extremely outdated similar to the drug odysseys in easy rider and really harms its flow because it s not needed other than that midnight cowboy is an almost flawless motion picture i was pleasantly surprised it does have its flaws flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been for instance and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy such as the gay movie theater sequence but if you can handle its content midnight cowboy is a truly great motion picture an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late s early s it s a depressing movie yes and by today s standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of life is horrible etc but i still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long long time highly recommended one of the best films of the s it was technically released in late but i d still categorize it as a s film it also won the best picture oscar being the first and only x rated motion picture to do so it was later re rated r on appeal 
watching midnight cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting directing cinematography editing writing i was too young to watch it when it was originally released and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago but it has absolutely stood the test of time and i have watched it several times since everything about this film is brilliant from the poignant performances from voight and hoffman even though i know this movie well i still find myself welling up every time voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks or hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences it s a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren t prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools 
in my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made in america and it deserved every single award it won and it s place on the afi top list though it s shamefully too low on the imdb top list at only as of this writing if you enjoy acting of the highest calibre voight and hoffman are a superb match well drawn characterizations and inventive direction editing and cinematography you ll love this just as much as i did schlesinger paints a vivid always credible picture of the late s new york city scene and it s many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality poverty and hopelessness of nd street new york city the filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground new york film movement and of the city and are nothing less than dazzling i ve seen many ideas including the rapid fire editing the handling of the voice over flashbacks the drug trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror stolen by other filmmakers the relationship between joe and ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship or having it s homosexual underpinnings i think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life whether it be sexual or not midnight cowboy is a brave moving film of magnitude influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it s impact over the years so if you haven t seen it you re really missing out on a true american classic i recommend this film to everyone score out of 
i typically don t like reality shows particularly the ones that are profiting off of american idol s success but this one i can live with comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts and if they like them those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do survivor style competitions using comedic tactics then one will be determined as last comic standing i do like stand up comedy so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through it started the careers of such talents as alonzo bodden ralphie may and josh blue my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama at first they lived together in a house like big brother but now they ve done away with that thank god and there are a lot of comedians i felt were only chosen not because they re funny but because of race ethnicity attitude sex etc when other comics clearly should ve beaten them out but overall it s a well made reality show which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron 
horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn t always win out over imagination we all know that killers like freddy jason michael and even leatherface shouldn t be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day most of us don t believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains and let s hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them this is where imagination wins out over fact horror and most films in general requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow this usually isn t a problem when i watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at george c scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near burketsville but what i do have a problem digesting without wanting to regurgitate is when a film has a killer like the one in this film to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed there are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is but the minutes prior to this point is a well done suspenseful blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by john hough if the film would have offered me a different killer then i would actually be raving about it this may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film but believe me anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me john cassevetes plays dr sam cordell he and his daughter jenny played beautifully by erin flannery have just recently moved to this small new england town cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman one can only presume it is his wife is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed again i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway cassevetes it has to be mentioned is strange to say the least cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities it never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james caan he has a deceptive smile and a virile commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice but he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene he just has that slimy disingenuous phlegmatic uneasy way about him he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film i guess that is a credit to the writers the director and to cassevetes himself there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get go the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry there is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see something or someone is watching them when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck the young woman wanders into the shed just to play a prank once she is there she is attacked the young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in he looks frantically scours the room and spots his would be lover bleeding in the corner and then smacko the guy gets it it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place he has another dream toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of galen throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped this is my first feeble and careful attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement it just didn t strike the right chord the incubus is a well done film it is tense tight and even most of the performances are very well done i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders but when you get through all that was good in the film you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth and bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones out of this could have been a nine too bad 
shocking well made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces small town doctor tries to discover who or what is committing a series of violent sexual murders incubus is a tight mystery with some horrific murder sequences that builds to an off beat and eerie climatic twist the murder scenes are intense and gory so this isn t a film for the squeamish the direction of john hough along with a bizarre music score combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight the cast isn t bad either the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town also good are the performances of kerrie keane as the local reporter helen hughes as the town historian and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teen all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re discovered and re evaluated out of 
this is a wonderful film first impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dissipated by a fun loving display of how men and women s baser motivations diverge vive la difference you can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses human beings are a bit rubbish really but we have big hearts and we try our best despite temptation it s not our fault when sometimes temptation can t be resisted that s just who we are there is a consistent stylishness from start to finish crisp photography and sharp composition very pleasant viewing when you add provocative content well suited music and laugh out loud scripting watch out for the very young lone wise voice brilliant wisdom from innocence balancing comedy from the human condition 
this is truly the greatest swedish movie of all time not only is it revolutionary in its narration but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of swedish humor and swedish comedians felix herngren and fredrik lindstr m are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in sweden today and this film really puts that on display vuxna m nniskor adult people is a warm hearted and hilarious story about adulthood and the question if we wouldn t be better off without it 
high energy raoul walsh classic from the bowery places saloon owner and operator wallace beery against bitter rival and dandy george raft with adopted street kid jackie cooper and good looking faye wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry it s not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids plenty of wisecracks at the beginning but the characters soften up as the film progresses apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in beery s saloon the various characters sexy chorus line lots of drinking a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so called pre code restrictions and then later come the carrie nations led by carrie nation herself it all creates a very vivid picture of a life that s long gone i don t like to compare eras but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today the film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see 
in brooklyn a century ago the rivalry between chuck connors and steve brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to brodie s famous bet that he can jump off the brooklyn bridge this is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a bugs bunny spoof bowery bugs from this generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some chinese tenement dwellers a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes giving the film a great deal of historical interest in my view 
george raft as steve brodie the carefree dancing gambler who can never refuse a dare is pitted against the lumbering sentimental chuck connors wallace beery a soft touch for every panhandler connors impulsively adopts waifs and strays notably runaway orphan swipes jackie cooper complete with kittens and the homeless lucy calhoun an out of town innocent with ambitions to become a writer in this male dominated culture communication takes place mostly in the form of violence one sees why the bowery is a martin scorsese favorite exploding cigars provide a running gag swipes enjoys throwing rocks through windows in chinatown on one occasion setting a laundry alight the simultaneous arrival of both brodie s and beery s volunteer fire companies leads to a brawl during which the building burns to the ground beery casually saps a troublesome girl and thumps anyone who disagrees with him including brodie whom he defeats in a night time fist fight on a moored barge to regain control of his saloon lost on a bet that brodie wouldn t have the courage to jump off the brooklyn bridge brodie does make the leap but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment as usual walsh fills the frame with detail illustrating with relish the daily life of the tenderloin singing waiters bullying barmen whores from suicide hall being hustled into the black maria tailors collaring hapless hicks off the street and forcing them to buy suits they don t want a minor but admirable little film 
a favourite of mine this movie tells of two feuding new york characters steve brodie raft and chuck connors beery who both strive to be the main guy in the bowery in the late nineteenth century brodie and connors were real people though this is a heavily fictionalized account of their antics based on a play brodie s legendary did he do it it s still a cause of argument jump from the brooklyn bridge for which he became famous is shown here as happening around the same time as the spanish american war director walsh clearly had a great affection for the period so beautifully recreated here and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer trixie odbray a young pert kelton raft is at his slickest as brodie and beery shows again what a clever actor he was as tough big hearted and at times quite touching connors pretty fay wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing full of life and energy the bowery moves at a fast pace unlike many early talkies it is not an easy movie to find but is well worth looking out for 
culled from the real life exploits of chuck connors and steve brodie in s new york the bowery is high energy and good natured but be warned casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of wallace beery and little jackie cooper the very first shot might be startling this is true to the time it was set and the time it was made and it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods it certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere beery as connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action a loud mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade and he has a soft spot for ornery orphan cooper raft as brodie is connors slicker better looking rival in almost every endeavor brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention leading up to a jump off the brooklyn bridge it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy beery is as bombastic as ever with a put on irish american accent he is just the gruff sort of character to draw children cats and ladies in distress this is possibly the most boisterous character raft ever played and he even gets to throw in a little dancing as well as a show of leg and again he mistakes the leading lady lovely fay wray for a prostitute cooper is as tough as either of them though he gets a chance to turn on the tears the highlight isn t the jump off the bridge but a no holds barred fistfight between connors and brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals it s sure someone bruised more than an ego 
when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores jud this is not steven kings best work i thought that his best work was the shining i don t think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick i mean making the gage evil and how he kills jud is genius making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool people who didn t like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all don t expect something from a movie that it isn t it still in a general area wasn t that good i still recommend people to watch the movie
did sandra yes she must have know we would still be here for her some nine years later see it if you haven t again if you have see her live while you can 
overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come although the plot is not accurate to the book most everything is correct the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie because i hadn t found out about the movie yet but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected overall i give this movies a out of for its good parts relative accuracy and overall making sense and for its bad parts large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies 
personally i absolutely love this movie and novel i read the book first and decided to see the movie first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind the acting is also great and i love the cast judd crandall plays fred gwynne fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you there are also a few corny lines thrown in there idk if they were meant to be corny but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie not only will you love it but you ll want to see it again and again i recommend this to any horror fan 
ah clich s clich s clich s they re a main part of a wide variety of horror films this one has a lot of them still it s stephen king one of the best masters of horror this movie was really good just too predictable and what horror movie doesn t have stupid people this one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken pet semetary i found to be creepy a little the way everything is set up was really spooky but not terrifying for the most part the acting was somewhat believable the suspense wasn t that suspenseful but the entertainment level is set at a major rank my eyes were practically glued to the screen all stephen king fans must see this movie but as for anyone else expect an okay thriller 
so often with stephen king adaptations you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books this really captures the heart of the book maybe because they don t use large chunks of text straight from the book but it s a bit more of an improv of the events in the story a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage dale midkiff and denise tasha yar crosby really act like his parents there s a scene where louis is cuddling gage and they are very natural together fred gwynne is wonderful he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody and is wise and warm just like jud should be out of 
 pet sematary succeeds on two major situations first it s a scary horror movie those that just aren t produced in these days second it s an emotional clever movie overall so if you are looking for chills scares creepiness and visually stunning settings great acting dialongs and gruesome effects this is the movie you are looking for a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan probably the best adaptation to any of king s novels the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel but that doesn t means that this underrated movie isn t a complete horror drama accomplishment stephen king s novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time the movie captures the same feeling mainly because there s a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it s members then when everything seems to be happiness technically happy because the title pet sematary does not offers appiness a tragic event changes the movie s atmosphere now it turns very dark the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad gray creepy dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family s entire life and pet sematary proves it dramatically the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot sadly enough the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it s something much much worse what will happened with the lives of our all american family could pascow prevent this tragedy what is it with the surreal nightmares watch pet sematary to witness one of the most touching emotional horror movies of recent times you won t regret the acting is very good although i didn t dig the actor who portrayed the father he didn t seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation but that s just my opinion denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble tender mother baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts shivers overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people s deepest fears the loss of someone you love the dead returning to life and a feeling of desperation something is for sure i don t wanna be buried in a pet sematary 
i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen king s books this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable i have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart wrenching as well as scary the scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out and the no fair uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance 
pet semetary the creed family have just moved into the small town of ludlow the family consists of a father louis a mother rachel a brother gage and a daughter ellen they are greeted with kindness by jud crandall jud is and could basically tell you about the entire history of ludlow behind the creed s new house there is a path leading to a pet cemetery spelled pet sematary when ellen wants to go up to see it jud willfully takes the family on a trip that is the start of hell for the creed family when rachel and the kids are gone ellen s cat church dies jud feels that ellen isn t ready for the death of her cat so he suggests louis follow him further up the path past the pet cemetery jud tells louis of this burial ground once used by micmac indians louis buries church without jud s help a couple of days later church returns alive but from hell this movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me aside from the exorcist the greatest performance would ever be zelda rachel s sister with spinal meningitis or victor pascow a ghost who tries to help the creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead the music in this movie plays an extravagant part it is at the same time sad and mysterious it goes along with the movie wonderfully 
i am a big fan of stephen king s work and this film has made me an even greater fan of king pet sematary is about the creed family they have just moved into a new house and they seem happy but there is a pet cemetery behind their house the creed s new neighbor jud played by fred gwyne explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery that burial ground is pure evil jud tells louis creed that when you bury a human being or any kind of pet up in the burial ground they would come back to life the only problem is that when they come back they are not the same person they re evil soon after jud explains everything about the pet sematary everything starts to go to hell i wont explain anymore because i don t want to give away some of the main parts in the film the acting that pet sematary had was pretty good but needed a little bit of work the story was one of the main parts of this movie mainly because it was so original and gripping this film features lots of make up effects that make the movie way more eerie and frightening one of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back was in fact the make up effects there is one character in this film that is truly freaky that character is zelda this particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise zelda is rachel creed s sister who passed away years before but rachel is still haunted by her the first time zelda appears in the movie isn t generally scary because she isn t talking or anything but the second time is the worst and to be honest the second time scares the living out of me there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie it is almost perfect pet sematary delivers great scares some pretty good acting first rate plot and mesmerizing make up this is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time out of 
one of the best if not the best stephen king s screenings dark as dark can be surprising non hollywood ending terrifying atmosphere amazing book adaptation outstanding cast educational don t play with afterlife in short everything an excellent horror should be my favorite horror movie straight 
i kind of liked the lonely lady give pia a break she looks great and she has really nice eyes what s not to like the scene where she gets raped by ray liotta with a garden hose was kind of gross and cruel actually a lot of stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel but its a trashy movie a lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad i liked this better than valley of the dolls which was not only trashy but boring as well at least this wasn t boring pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer watching her talk about pushkin and byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable i m sure pia s a nice person in real life she just doesn t project the writer vibe she looked much happier when she was working as a hostess for that guy from saturday night fever and wearing a glittery disco dress a couple of the scenes are funny the one where she tells the two timing actor that she s pregnant and he rolls his eyes and snaps at her to stop hanging around all the while he s practically fawning over every bimbo who flounces by pia s nervous breakdown scene is good it was probably a mistake to go so supernova on it the vortex of floating faces and freeze frame scream whoa and her subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of overdone the acceptance speech is a hoot though i want to see someone do that speech in a drama class but again this is trash we re talking about you could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties 
the title has many meanings the boxing ring where differences and grievances are fought out a wedding ring where mabel feels trapped and jack feels his troubles will be over and the cause of the trouble a ring like bracelet that bill gives mabel as a love token former professional boxer danish carl brisson was given his start in films by alfred hitchcock in the ring a very young ian hunter who went on to have such a long career in movies plays bob corby who catches the eye of a pretty girl mabel lillian hall davis at a fun fair she happens to be engaged to one round jack sander carl brisson but that doesn t stop her flirting with bob bob is persuaded to go one round with jack he goes several rounds and wins he is a professional boxer and he and his manager have come to the fair to find out if jack is as good a fighter as they have heard he offers to take jack on and jack goes off along with his boorish trainer the great gordon harker to make his fortune with plans to marry mabel when he makes good jack wins his fight and marries mabel the next day but the deep attraction that she and bob feel for each other is still there jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight bob for his wife at last a boxing movie where the hero doesn t go off the rails bob behaves himself and does everything he can to be a champion if only mabel acted in the same way she has left him for bob and the fight at the end is a mighty one it is intensely realistic it occupies the last minutes of the film from being raw and enthusiastic jack is almost knocked out then between rounds reuniting with mabel gives him the courage to triumph the question is why would he even want her back from the start she thought nothing of starting an affair with bob why wouldn t she do it again the film is loaded with symbolism jack shaking hands with the promoter changes to mabel s hands accepting a bracelet from bob when jack puts the ring on mabel s finger bobs bracelet slips down her arm at the end jack sees mabel s reflection in a ringside water bucket and that gives him the confidence to go on this is an excellent film that will not disappoint you highly recommended 
hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straight forward drama without much to recommend it hitchcock s talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point of view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcock s early work and his development as a visual storyteller 
i sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of hitchcock s lesser known films because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden hitchcock gem or a true hitchcock great or some other generic if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great hitchcock film just as much as vertigo north by northwest psycho rear window etc so that being said i would just like to say that if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great hitchcock film just as much as vertigo north by northwest psycho rear window etc now that may be overshooting a little bit the ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above but compared to the other films that hitchcock made in the late s and early s i really think that the ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them as an almost brand new director there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career granted the film does start with among other things the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer and i use idiot in the definitive manner the way stephen king so often does having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people i suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then but i think it is one of the most off putting sequences in any hitchcock film i ve seen the main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round but when he meets his match it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife s finger so begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly spoilers there is for example a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and just before going into the building she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss this kiss is never explained and there is also the fact that even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband or at least ultimately chooses him they look into each other s eyes but do not actually kiss the film is certainly beautifully photographed even more so than several films that hitch released in subsequent years there is also a performance by gordon harker as one round jack s trainer who in his stone faced expressionism reminds me quite often of the brilliant buster keaton hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous but this is a great sample of his early work 
sandra bernhard s without you i m nothing the movie released in followed on the heels of her off broadway stage production what she and others refer to in the movie as her smash hit one woman show there were several changes in monologues and one liners and the movie version visually re vamps the story taking sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage performer in new york during what she calls her superstar summer to an illusory almost desperate existence back in her home in los angeles her fictional manager in the film refers to it as getting sandra back to her roots to upscale supper clubs like the parisian room there s a point to be made here sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of american pop culture to an audience that doesn t completely see it in l a she s playing to a predominantly black audience trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is shashonna a madonna look alike stripper and even then with shashonna dancing to drum beats that resemble those from like a virgin there s not much to be said for the audience s enjoyment of the show the scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone a funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping shashonna out of her pants but if she s going down sandra s doing so with style and force conveying everything from foul confidence to punctured vulnerability right to the point at which she s naked literally pleading for acceptance and yet somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom her depictions of interactions with the likes of calvin klein jerry lewis bianca jagger ralph lauren and what we re lead to believe is warren beatty are fictional and hilarious sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment performing a quiet but mystifying rendition of nina simone s song four women while dressed in a mufti and other african garb singing lines such as my skin is black my hair is wooly and they call me sweet thing she resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in a tremendously funny description of the frenzied estate auction for andy warhol leave it to andy to have the wisdom and sensitivity into the hours and hours of toil and labor that went into the indian product that they ve been so lucky to cash in on this whole santa fe thing happening she expounds on the excessiveness of hollywood consoling a distraught friend then admonishing him saying mister if this is about ishtar i m getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because that s too self indulgent even for me sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism dressed as a cosmo girl sandra retells her young girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss she eventually concludes in relief i ll never be a statistic not me i m under and i m going to be married sandra extols the opening of sexuality in society when he touches you in the night does it feel all right or does it feel real i say it feels real mighty real finally she cries for change in progressive american society by channeling disco greats patrick cowley and sylvester and proclaiming eventually everyone will funk all this comes in the form of glitzy schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and originated by billy paul burt bacharach hank williams and laura nyro to name a few at the same time the idealized fictional incarnation of sandra her self generated mirror image floats around town a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the kabala studying chemistry and listening to nwa rap music in without you i m nothing sandra bernhard explores emotions and existences that up until then she d only toyed with as a regular guest on late night with david letterman her almost child like enthusiasm for shock exhibited throughout the s is thrown aside in the face of a subtler allure and her confidence in the face of materialism and american celebrity proves refreshing this approach to comedy would change sandra s direction forever and mark the more mature more personable entertainer to come if you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in inside jokes about glamour celebrity sex loneliness despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship this movie will keep you in stitches it may not be meant to be funny across the board perhaps it s a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some but consider the emptiness of the world sandra paints for you and you ll understand just how funny and brilliant she really is but see without you i m nothing with a friend in the know because it s definitely funnier that way before you know it the two of you will be trading sandra barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone else 
at first i thought the ring would be a more than normal movie with it s ordinary plot how surprised was i of course the plot is simple one girl is in love with two men but hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter with laughter and fear with compassion and anguish the way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest movies north by northwest the rope etc the master did it great even before his thirties 
this movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space as a history of space flight it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it disney has shown it on vault disney and i wish they would do so again 
buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when humanizing animals and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them based on a true story buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other and that they will do anything for each other while not a perfect movie the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children this film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets but does show the difficulties a recommended film which was the first for jim henson productions 
not to be confused with the british black comedy of the same name that came out in but this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the s backwoods slasher the plot goes sorority girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in florida but they re plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman and when he realizes that he was seen well let s just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff shallow grave in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the s especially the late s which was when the slashers kinda went downhill this was one of the few that didn t and this movie should be more well known it s a pity it isn t this is one film that actually confounds stereotypes just try guessing who the final girl is going to be i got it totally wrong the principle cast are all likable and it s one of those movies that you kinda hope they all get away which of course they don t this coupled with the fluffiness of the film s first half an hour jars in a good way with some flashes of real nastiness the second murder provides a real jolt and some unexpected sleaziness even though this isn t a high budget thriller i didn t expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast in a film from this late in the s there are one or two bad things about this movie well not bad just minor like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which doesn t go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the deputy inability to follow logic there aren t any sharp implements in shallow grave but to my mind at least it s a slasher flick through and through the scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the malevolent sheriff are tense and exciting all in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile slasher with great performances from all four of the main girls and that psycho sheriff 
i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst the gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially lifelike it s even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla it s an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really can t treat them just like people because they aren t not many films venture into this territory and it s worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human animal similarity 
this picture came out in and it was the second in the three part series of the life of sheriff buford pusser bo svenson takes over the role of sheriff buford pusser and luke askew plays the role of mobster pinky dobson the last that we saw sheriff pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed sunday morning drive after pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife is pusser able to complete the revenge that he s after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes the only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story how could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don t do anything about it since there was real no name actress in this picture i can t give it weasel stars but i can give 
here s a real weirdo for you it starts out with another take off on the psycho shower scene on campus then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for spring break the trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal sheriff dean one of the college cuties wanders into the woods witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open then it s lets rip off macon county line time as dean stalks traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one tony march is on target as the evil shotgun happy dean the movie s overall tone is truly disturbing the ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film it s also a study in despair shallow grave is a must for misanthropes misogynists and nihilists the world over 
aim for the top gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it i totally loved this series and to this day it remains my favorite anime and while it was not gainax s first animated product it was their first ova series mainly starting out as a parody of the s sports drama aim for the ace ace o nerae gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode when noriko takaya is forced to relive the death of her father who was killed in mankind s initial encounter with the insect race humanity is at war with it is because of her father s death that noriko wants to become a combat pilot but her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters her friend kazumi amano even has doubts about noriko being chosen as a pilot however noriko s coach koichiro ota has faith in her and he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot for he was a survivor of the battle in which noriko s father was killed other characters include jung freud a russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron noriko and kazumi belong to smith toren a love interest for noriko who is killed in their first sortie together and kimiko higuchi noriko s childhood friend kimiko s involvement is also of interest as while noriko is off in space kimiko remains behind on earth to live a normal life and because of the acts of time dilation kimiko ages normally on earth while noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school by the end of the series noriko is roughly years old while kimiko is in her mid fifties all in all this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of gainax animation if you like hideaki anno s other shows or are a fan of haruhiko mikimoto s artwork then give this show a chance it will grow on you 
tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself there are a few surprises as cynical as we are today i fully expected the good girl to be crying over his grave instead of his buddy s especially with her remarks about going to the funeral of her best friend when she first meets matt and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr allen s face blinding him interesting role by bruce dern wrrrooonnnnggg some of the other hollywood endings do happen but the writing is so excellent the acting so carefully wrought that you re blissfully unaware and the music is out of this world taking us back to the s when our native passions were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago but at a club called wonderfully biloxi with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks i ll be watching it again just to hear the music good thing i have the factotum sound track so i can listen to that in the car watch both together and you ll see how matt has matured playing bar room characters in both now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc he probably has great opportunity to do his studies great actor just coming into his own he shows finely nuanced performances the good and the bad in his characters his young boy off the farm is a great study made especially poignant because of his bassett hound eyes he makes love convincingly as well since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen ager i wonder how that it making love to an actress you kinda grew up with adds conviction i ll say that 
what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be this is the type of film that i ve been looking for ages particularly important for me was the fantastic looking chicago which i still keep thinking about the back cover doesn t do this film justice it s superb and in my top for sure 
star trek hidden frontier will surprise you in many ways first it s a fan made series available only on the web and it features mainly friends neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to as mickey judy once put it put on a show it s definitely friends neighbors to you can tell a lot of these people aren t the most beautiful looking folks you ve ever seen or the youngest or the thinnest some of them stumble through their lines like they re walking on marbles some of them have thick accents or simply don t seem to speak well in the first place whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that they re saying still you have to admit for everything these friends neighbors have put together it s actually fun to watch yes some of the dialogue is hokey yes it s a little odd though admittedly a little cool too watching two starfleet males kiss although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on yes you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from st tos tng other shows and the movies or when you hear the theme from galaxy quest played at the beginning and end of every show okay we can get by that why the graphics are first rate better than almost anything you ve seen and sometimes a show or two really stands out story wise some of them are actually real tear jerkers hidden frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due it takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude people sets costumes graphics it s a huge effort on a lot of people s parts we watch we return and we thank them 
hidden frontiers is more than fan fiction it is well thought out and organized series keeping the worlds of star trek alive and growing from a fun little fan project to now a well known net series hidden frontiers has a bit of something for every star trek fan in it set in the late star trek next generation ds and voyager time lines hidden frontier takes on topics and issues raised in other star trek series with set stories using a well developed characters plots and story arcs star trek hidden frontier has taken on social context stories that gene roddenberry failed to bring to the screen and has shown the development of characters in long term space assignments the real things that happen in close quarters as well as an exciting spatial wars and conflicts sci fi addicts know and love done in a green screen studio hidden frontiers brings a rollicking cast of regulars on to the screen and into your hearts the large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project inventive use of green screen technology props makes up and costumes work to make the hidden frontier worlds of star trek fun and believable hidden frontier has gone where few tread to go in the world of science fiction and thrived once they got there hidden frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought out website with interesting discussion forums access to creative production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat i highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch 
this is short and to the point the story writing used for star trek hidden frontier is surprisingly good acting is all over the map but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills it is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost years and will be coming to end mid may i will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics considering this is all volunteer for no profit it is pretty amazing if this was being ranked as a professional production i would have to give it a for a good story but terrible sets however as a fan based production i have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts this is in a league of its own for sheer volume i don t think this has been matched congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire 
four teenage girlfriends drive to fort laurdale for spring break unfortunately they get a flat tire in medley georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods the local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins shallow grave is a pleasant low budget surprise the cast is likable enough the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic especially the second murder is pretty grim the murderous sheriff isn t one dimensional character in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels remorse for what he s done the subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting out of 
i really like star trek hidden frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more i have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it i have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view i have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out i rated it a ten but i think it deserves a loll my compliments to the staff of the star trek hidden frontiers on an excellent job if u like star trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film the detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it
okay so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way but from the beginning hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances and have always been willing to mistakes they ve made they advice people to see newer episodes first so they can see just how good the show is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on screen the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show as the story lines go from strength to strength the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines depression drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way but that is what star trek is and was all about it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way dealing with them subtly and smoothly yes they have used some characters from trek history but they have done them justice characters like shelby lefler and necheyev vastly underused in the show had a rebirth in the new frontier books but they lost their sizzle after a while when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci fi and hf shows those characters in a completely different light which serves them better the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved they release bloopers for every episode so the fans can see what a laugh they have because they are people doing it in their spare time with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide eyed in shock what this series now drawing to a close after years has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing bringing people together inspiring others to do the same hf will live for a long time after it ends as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place 
hidden frontier is a fan made show in the world of star trek the story takes place after voyager has returned from the delta quadrant it has some characters from the official star trek shows but most of them are original to the show the show takes place on the star base deep space and on several space ships which gives it opportunities the official shows don t have the characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy which characters in shows with only one ship doesn t have the show has good computer animation of spaceships but the acting takes place in front of at green screen and it gives a green glow around the actors not all the actors are equally good but most do fine the episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes that is a bit more like in babylon than in most official star trek shows hidden frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using all in all i enjoyed watching it 
hidden frontier is notable for being the longest running internet based star trek fan series while the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like starship exeter or new voyages hidden frontier concentrates largely on story and in that regard it does very well indeed hidden frontier has no physical sets instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen and the backgrounds inserted digitally one of hidden frontier s greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced one of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming instead of in post production while this does save a great deal of time it s also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post production though it still serves its purpose while it may not be everyone s cup of tea hidden frontier is well worth a shot though you might be best to start off watching the third season since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride 
i really enjoyed this one and although the ending made me angry i still give it out of four college girls baltron kelly stahl and cadby are driving down to florida on their way they meet guys turner davis they really add nothing to the plot but are at least somewhat likable the girls agree to meet the guys in florida for some fun but they have car problems and never make it one of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help the other three stay by the car soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes soon she witnesses as a man march strangles a woman in terror the girl flees the area she doesn t get very far but manages to get lost her friends by the car go looking for her they too go into the woods and run into the same man one of them sees the dead woman the man responds by shooting the girls head off the other girl runs away manages to make it back to the car where she is also killed eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested this is when i started getting mad these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops don t believe them they are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell the remaining friend manages to escape but not without getting in dangerous situations this movie has nudity good actresses a shower scene imitating psycho graphic violence towards women and solid story some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will not like the ending but over all this is a great little unknown movie 
i have just watched the whole episodes on dvd the acting throughout is excellent no question there was not quite enough action for me i must say no real suspense as such just plenty of first class character development nothing like tinker tailor in terms of whodunnit if you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you peter egan as the lead magnus pym is excellent the film portrayed the life of a traitor a man who should have been a loyal member of the british intelligence service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things as a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time time again as a crook and a con man pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him wife son mentor pym is fatally damaged by his father s influence it has eaten his moral fibre away he has no real love or loyalty in him heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the hour series very well done though 
i agree with all the accolades i went through a box of tissues watching this film it had a gritty authenticity and rang true in every way the question i m about to raise represents a current sensibility regarding the treatment of animals i had a very difficult time with the beginning slaughter of sheep and goats and the dying deer with its pulsing neck and pooling blood as its life drained away was hideous this is the age of no animals were hurt in the production of this move iphigenia was made in the late s before the advent of computer simulation was it possible to fake these animal deaths or were these animals slaughtered for art 
it s been a long time since i saw this mini series and i am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time most of the components of a perfect spy the adaptation of lecarr s finest novel in my opinion are top drawer outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay the latter written by arthur hopcraft who was also i believe the screenwriter for tinker tailor soldier spy with alec guinness a few years before the actors are mostly very good some superb like alan howard s jack brotherhood and ray mcanally s ricky pym peter egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle the passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done so much so that i wondered exactly how old peter egan was at the time of filming the only jolt comes after the character of magnus pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named benedict taylor to those of a noticeably too old peter egan just fresh out of oxford but this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be upset emotionally ie cry none of the actors have a very easy time with these moments aside from the wonderful frances tomelty who plays peggy wentworth for all she s worth and steals the episode with ease jane booker is annoying as mary pym she has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife which mary pym is r diger weigang is splendid as axel amusing ironic and brilliant i also enjoyed sarah badel s camp turn as the baroness the british view of americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes when the yanks have come abroad to confab with bo brammell head of mi the american contingent are portrayed as empty headed buffoons who appear to have memorized a lot of long words out of the dictionary and spiced them liberally with american jargon and psycho babble much to the bemused scorn of the english the humor and sadness are subtly blended lecarr has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy yet wistful atmosphere of the original not a perfect production what is and yet the best of the lecarr adaptations to reach film or television to date highly recommended to all spy thriller lovers and especially lecarr fans dvd available from acorn 
without doubt the best of the novels of john le carre exquisitely transformed into a classic film performances by peter egan magnus pym the perfect spy rudiger weigang axel real name alexander hampel magnus czech intelligence controller ray mcanally magnus con man father and alan howard jack brotherhood magnus mentor believer and british controller together with the rest of the characters are so perfect and natural the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award even the small parts such as major membury are performed to perfection it says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that despite the duplicity of magnus one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimy grant lederer of u s intelligence i have read the book at least a dozen times and watched the movie almost as many times and continue to be mesmerized by both if i had one book to take on a desert island a perfect spy would be the choice above all others 
well if you are looking for a great mind control movie this is it no movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control and naked marie forsa as the busty helga is under just about everytime she falls asleep and a few times when she isn t one wishes they made more movies like this one 
well the story is a little hard to follow the first time but that s only because of all the bare breasted s painted up vampire witches dancing to the bongo drums this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them and for girl on girl action vampiric or not this movie just rocks 
this is an excellent show i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this there are many facts in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable mr wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down 
jane porter s former love interest harry holt neil hamilton and his friend martin paul cavanagh come to tarzan s hidden away jungle escarpment searching for the ivory gold mine that is the elephant s graveyard first seen in tarzan the ape man only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions namely jane will tarzan stand for that not likely in fact tarzan won t even stand for any disturbance done to the elephant s graveyard and knowing this martin attempts to take tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party including jane who leaves with them after she believes tarzan is dead is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions will tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time this film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer s interest and doesn t let up the cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and shouldn t be taken so seriously 
make no mistake maureen o sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever and there will never be one more gorgeous she is visually stunning that aside it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film this is a great film it not only has the classic tarzan aura but also the feel of the continuing saga we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory one of them in love with jane the other a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted however the africans are depicted as individuals and at the end two even become more heroic than the white hunters and stand out as such in fact the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters the finale also is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie the great lion attack has never been duplicated and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction if i left anything out it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who haven t seen it but it is everything you could want in a movie 
a year after losing gorgeous jane parker maureen o sullivan to love rival tarzan hunter harry holt neil hamilton returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe s heart mixing business with pleasure he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the mutia escarpment tarzan s stomping ground accompanied by his slimy womanising pal martin arlington and a group of expendable bearers harry finally arrives at his destination having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock hurling apes only to find that jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller and worse still that tarzan is refusing to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard nasty arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape man and then telling jane and holt that tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile of course tarzan isn t dead only wounded after being nursed back to health by cheetah he swings back into action just in time to rescue jane from a tribe of vicious lion eating savages who have attacked holt s expedition tarzan and his mate the second movie to star weismuller as the jungle man of few words is often cited by fans as the best of the series although i slightly prefer the original i can definitely understand the film s popularity it s damn sexy and there are some great action sequences the undeniable chemistry between weismuller and o sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes and with both stars wearing eensy weensy outfits throughout there s eye candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes to enjoy despite o sullivan s much touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin even threatening to do a sharon stone at one point as her loin cloth flaps to one side the film s most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile and the spectacular final where jane is attacked by lions and natives but is rescued by her beau his monkey pals and a load of elephants in full on lion crushing mode once again the violence is surprisingly nasty at times although as far as i am concerned there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film cheetah also has his fair share of excitement dodging rhinos crocs and big cats riding on tarzan s back as he crosses a river and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride like it s predecessor tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing props dodgy back projection a few laughable monkey suits more indian elephants masquerading as their african cousins and poorly disguised trapeze swings but these shouldn t spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film if anything they make it even more fun out of rounded up to for imdb 
i have the entire weissmuller tarzan series on dvd fully restored editions i never tire of watching them my personal favorite is tarzan and his mate due entirely well almost entirely to maureen o sullivan s costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front before anyone claims that a it wasn t really her or b it wasn t really what it looks like let me say that i have watched it numerous time in high zoom mode and trust me it is her and she is completely naked underneath that costume several times especially during the lion attack at the end careful viewing in slow motion and maximum zoom will reveal that she was shaved except for a tiny patch of dark hair covering her labia there is no mistake about that at all as to the swimming scene being a body double in a skin suit yes it is a double but she is not wearing any skin suit or anything else again slow motion and maximum zoom shows everything to those who want to see it now that controversy out of the way let s move on the actual movie i thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly the action sequences were simply great although it is obviously a stuntman riding the rhino weissmuller actually wrestles the big male lion the use of background shots that were second unit stuff from africa is very well blended with the studio us locations making it sometimes hard to tell which is which don t complain too much though remember that of all films is phony anyway so just relax and enjoy the damned thing with a big bowl of popcorn some cold beer and a fresh pack of smokes a sexy and willing girlfriend wife isn t out of line either lol oh one final word about nudity at the very beginning while the white hunters are speaking dialogue keep your eyes on the background extras there are several good shots of nude african girls obviously shot on location behind them one more thing the movie is not racist by the standards of the s until the s that s the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then shaft hadn t even been thought about at that time nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads and tiny s character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and jane as a matter of fact it wasn t until gene autry treated the native americans and colored people in his westerns like real human beings that hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so 
hard to believe perhaps but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose hayes code yes indeed priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin i m not making this up they had several reasons as follows item jane likes sex she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter she stretches sensuously and with a coquettish look she says tarzan you ve been a bad boy so they ve not only been having sex they ve been having kinky sex a few years later under the hays code people especially women weren t supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex item jane prefers a guileless if wise and resourceful savage tarzan to a civilized respectable nine to five man holt when holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from london she wavers a bit when holt tries to kill tarzan and holt and jane both believe he s dead she wavers a lot but when she realizes her man is very much alive the attractions of civilization vanish for her and why not tarzan s and jane s relationship is egalitarian he lacks the civilized insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as the head of his wife to boot he lacks many more civilized hangups for example jealousy when holt and his buddy arrive tarzan greets them both cordially knowing perfectly well that holt is jane s old flame when holt gets her dolled up in a london dress and is slow dancing with her to a portable phonograph tarzan drops out of a tree and draws his knife jealous nope he s merely cautious toward the weird music machine since he s never seen one before once it s explained he s cool item civilized holt is dirty minded savage tarzan is innocently sexy as jane slips into holt s lamplit tent holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress by contrast after tarzan playfully pulls the dress off kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water ballet the scene was filmed in three versions clothed topless and nude the scene was cut prior to the film s release but the nude version is restored in the video now available and when jane emerges and cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of civilized men and their hangups where is the universal prurience so dear to the hearts of seminarians nowhere that s where another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful item the notion that man is the crown of creation and animals are here only for man s use and comfort takes a severe beating holt and his buddy want to be guided to the elephant graveyard so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard you reader are thinking fat chance and you re right he s shocked he exclaims elephants sleep which to him explains everything jane explains tarzan s feelings which the two gentlemen find ridiculous item jane the ex civilized woman is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies holt and buddy blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals it is jane who maintains her cool while the boys panic she takes charge barks orders at them and passes out the rifles item jane s costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath the original idea was for her to be topless with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples which indeed is the case in one brief scene lastly several men of the cloth complained because the film was called tarzan and his mate rather than tarzan and his wife no comment of course tarzan who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends comes to the rescue routs the white hunters and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came the end so there you have it an utterly subversive film like all the other films about complex and interesting women see e g possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey which constituted such a flowing genre in the early s and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by jane s soprano version of the famous tarzan yell a nice touch which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions let s hear it for artistic freedom feminist jane and sex 
tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle some men come looking for ivory and to take jane back to civilization but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back even if that means killing tarzan this is a rarity a sequel that s better than the original tarzan the ape man of was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult there is tons of blatant racism a black man is shot to death point blank and no one really cares but this was there s also plenty of blood gore and violence for a movie and uncut prints have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude there s also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and it s implied they sleep together and have sex without being married this wouldn t bother anyone today but in this was pretty extreme that aside the movie is well directed very fast moving and full of adventure and excitement seeing weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and jane s outfit is pretty revealing too i still think maureen o sullivan is bad as jane but weismuller is perfect as tarzan everybody else is ok this is easily the best weismuller o hara tarzan out there well worth seeing but not for kids 
i only saw iphigenia once almost years ago but it has haunted me since one sequence particularly stays in mind and could only have been fashioned by a great director as michael cacoyanis undoubtedly is the context the weight of history and a mighty army and fleet all lie on king agamemnon s shoulders an act of sacrilege has becalmed the seas endangering his great expedition to troy he is told he must sacrifice his daughter iphigenia to apollo in order to gain the winds for the sails of the thousand ships he initially resists but comes around and tricks his wife clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the greek camp in order to marry the greatest of all warriors achilles clytemnestra and iphigenia arrive find out about the sacrifice and rage to the gods for protection and vengeance meanwhile the proud achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent dishonorable way he climbs a hill to tell iphigenia that he will protect her the shot the camera circles the two young people without looking directly at each other they bemoan their fate and the weakness of men that deceive their loved ones and lust for war suddenly they gaze at each other and for one moment we feel both their power and beauty and the unstated except by the camera irony that in another time another place they perhaps could love each other and be married it is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant what direction what camera what storytelling 
this splendidly directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm it is a first class adventure for many reasons i suggest fine photography strong imaginative qualities a delightful cast good simulated jungle locales and a very exciting storyline johnny weissmuller plays tarzan a mono syllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs creation but he is honest loyal brave and very courageous and he needs to be during this narrative as jane parker his wife who had been jane porter in the novels maureen o sullivan is very attractive and lively as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality the effect of the lighting the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm back lot which really works the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed but into their idyll come people searching from them emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated one is harry holt still in love with her who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him the gown and perfumes interest her but she refuses to leave tarzan tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals in scenes that look like a humanized king king the group claim to want to hunt animals and tarzan agrees for jane s sake to a bit of big game trapping but at some point the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition s heads minds tarzan is shot left for dead and the group force jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous elephant s graveyard but they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call in a most spectacular elephant filled scene he saves jane and what is left of the expedition who return home little richer but much wise as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband the film was directed by set design wizard cedric gibbons and quite beautifully too his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish neil hamilton is a very good harry paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally an unusual and well realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well recommended 
 tarzan and his mate the second of mgm s tarzan pictures picks up a year after the events of tarzan the ape man tarzan and jane have been living happily in the jungle and harry holt one of the expeditioners in the first film returns this time accompanied by the less than honorable martin arlington in quest of the ivory from the elephants graveyard naturally a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way the first film romanticized everything the jungle adventure romance itself wild animals and even death the second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences but a more serious tone underlies the action the characters dare to ask questions like what if something happened to tarzan what would jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself while these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn t always as much fun as the throw caution to the wind attitude of the original one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and jane s relationship tarzan still speaks very broken english but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate additionally their love for each other has really blossomed and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle most people consider tarzan and his mate superior to the original tarzan the ape man personally i liked the first film just a little bit better the main reason is that the relationship between the harry holt martin arlington team isn t nearly as likable as holt s relationship with james parker jane s father from the original the mr arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie the movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him also i don t want to give anything away but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him jane never finds out about those events so the ending isn t quite as satisfying as it could have been all of these detractors are relatively minor however and it s still a great movie like the first film tarzan and his mate has amazing action scenes wonderful wildlife footage and one of the screen s all time greatest romances if you liked the first film in the series this is definitely a sequel to see 
when i was a kid it was lex barker s time as tarzan i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller was tarzan and i wouldn t understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller s last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape it wasn t after many years that i came across tarzan and his mate and then i understood weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker gordon scott jock mahoney denny miller miles o keefe and cristopher lambert as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o sullivan a strong self minded active and no inhibitions woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn t kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it such behaviors were unthinkable with the janes to come such as brenda joyce vanessa brown virginia huston or dorothy hart all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle o sullivan character s sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily the combination is perfect another highlight in the movie is cheeta s secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day tarzan and his mate stands as a fine product in its genre tarzan films and perhaps as the best though i have to admit that i also enjoyed tarzan s greatest adventure made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect all gymnasium physical looks that doesn t fit for a rustic ape man good for jane and her mate 
i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you re planning a romantic evening with him her the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen after the original film we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other jane s skimpy jungle wear and tarzan s protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically but also quite sexually in love one s imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally romantically and sexually and jane s student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality the skin show in this film is off the charts in addition to jane s two piece sexy midriff leg and hip baring costume she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan although it is not o sullivan but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene weissmuller also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips it s a shame that the over protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie 
as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies unlike others however i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made this occurs when harry s safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals the pre censorship production values add a lot of realism genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle the film also offers though perhaps antecedently an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers in addition sexy jane thousands of elephants some great sets and two chetas not to be missed an adventure classic 
i saw this movie once as a kid on the late late show and fell in love with it it took years but i recently did find it on dvd it wasn t cheap either in a catalog that specialized in war movies we watched it last night for the first time the audio was good however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels even so it was better than i remembered it i was also impressed at how true it was to the play the catalog is around here someplace if you re sincere in finding it fire me a missive and i ll see if i can get you the info cartwrightbride yahoo com
this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a year old kid in when it was shown on a los angeles television station s late show the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape nor is it ever shown on television apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart the playwright producer director who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than years after it was made i did not see the movie again for over years when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a bootlegged copy on vhs poor video quality but good audio my memory of it was correct it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars just starting out in their careers at the time went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well known and fully employed actors e g judy holliday edmond o brien jeanne crain barry nelson don taylor karl malden peter lind hayes george superman reeves red buttons lee j cobb kevin mccarthy and gary merrill the scenes with the b liberators are terrific especially the close up shots where the details of the giant for those times engine bomber then manufactured now nearly extinct can be seen good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew of course very gender biased as was the trend of the day only the men became pilots the women just supported them in their roles hardly acceptable in today s world i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy 
oh those sneaky italians it s not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the in this case author of the novel of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it james m cain s publishers managed to keep this movie off american screens until but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic the movie is not as great to watch as the american version but it s a great movie nevertheless this of course not in the least is due to the movie it s great strong story that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it these early drama s always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts the movie could had easily ended minutes earlier nevertheless i don t really have much else negative to say about this movie it s simply a greatly made one based on some equally great and strong source material quite an impressive directorial debut for luchino visconti who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies 
visconti s first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique accompanied by compelling performances from massimo girotti as the handsome drifter and best of all clara calamai as the fabulous frantic giovanna remade several times as the postman rings twice but never bettered can t believe this was the man s first film it shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career 
when people nowadays hear of a s drama they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it s another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic melancholic roles this opinion however does not resemble neorealist movies in particular this one directed by count luchino visconti ossessione as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others the contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past at the same time while being based on the novel by james m cain the postman always rings twice it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style view his own art i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which i d like to entail below first visconti s movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life in particular those absorbed by desire these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face gino massimo girotti a traveler with bear like shoulders turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enters the tavern although many people go there to have a meal gino occurs to get something more much more the indefatigable desire of beautiful giovanna clara calamai a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar mr giuseppe bragana juan de landa her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together however are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire can one build love upon murder what is love and what is loyalty does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession such questions intensely arise while watching the movie when to the core the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters we have to love each other affectionately answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything isn t it what we both wanted says one of the couple it occurs that it s not therefore the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart yet it constantly remains thought provoking second ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots who can possibly skip that moment in ferrara where gino meets a beautiful girl a sort of ragazza perfetta perfect girl a dancer anita and buys her ice cream his desires show him totally different direction do viewers remain indifferent at gino giovanna s first meeting the first focus of camera is on giovanna s legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that gino experiences a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look third ossessione can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast massimo girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet consequently what comes out is a flawless acting he portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim which represents conscience his bisexuality is indicated through the character of lo spagnolo elio marcuzzo whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for ancona clara calamai who was cast in the role after eminent anna magnani had refused fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple they are both very convincing besides i liked juan de langa in the role of bragana he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art in some of his most witty moments he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance in sum we as modern viewers who are capable of critical view have to look at this film very objectively it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet is it educational visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity in such case his films would only entertain which is of course not entirely fellini s style too visconti always had something to convey what did he want to say here is the film against bad marriage or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire the final shocking moments say for themselves though you don t have to agree with the vision ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film one of visconti s best 
to get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track not only the music but the way all sounds help to weave the imagery how beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside giovanna s marriage don t expect to find much here of the political life of italy in that s not what this is about on the other hand if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo realism by the end of the film we there are moments antonioni like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places this is one of my favorite visconti films 
tcm is keeping me awake all the time they keep coming up with films ive never heard of senso now ossessione a very early film by visconti wow the italian version of the postman always rings twice brilliant beautifully acted and directed never heard of either leads who were excellent clara calamai as giovanna and especially massimo girotti as gino what a sensual man more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in his look was ahead of its time many male stars from the s were probably inspired by him he should have been a major world wide star the film is much better than the jack nicholson jessica lange version and less glossier than the mgm version which i really like with john garfield and lana turner remember that white outfit who can forget this italian version is different more realistic and with a very different ending see it watch it im going to buy it 
ossessione is in very bad state but is now undergoing a full restoration at digital film lab in copenhagen the material used is a master positive nd generation originally from the print visconti managed to hide from the fascists it has been scanned on the spirit k as k rgb data then processed using davinci revival restoration software after this the rest is manual labor and we do not anticipate finishing before early spring sometime next year it should be available on dvd and hopefully also released on hd dvd this film is beautiful and we hope the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come 
luchino visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries the great directors of italy of the s and s were men who understood the medium but it was luchino visconti a man of vision who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing he clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with ossessione a film based on james cain s the postman always ring twice which was later made by hollywood but that version pales in comparison with what visconti achieved in the movie luchino visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited alberto moravia a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings the film has been well preserved in the dvd format we watched recently the film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how visconti s vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way something the american version lacked what comes across watching the movie is the intensity which the director got from his key players the magnificent clara calamai does an amazing job as giovanna the woman who has married an older man but when gino appears in her life all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life giovanna is one of the best creations in ms calamai s achievements in the italian cinema the last sequence of the film shows ms calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed equally excellent is massimo girotti one of the best actors of his generation who appears as gino the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in giovanna gino is the perfect man for giovanna something that mr girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen mr girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent juan delanda is seen as giuseppe the older man who fell in love with giovanna in fact his character rings truer than his counterpart in the american film where he is seen more as a buffoon the film is beautifully photographed by domenic scala and aldo tonti they gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way italian directors of the era favored the original musical score of giuseppe rosati is perfect visconti a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors also includes arias by bizet and verdi that fit well in the context of the movie ossessione is a film to treasure because we see a great luchino visconti at the top of his form 
 some spoilers i have not read the james m cain novel `the postman always rings twice on which this movie was based so i cannot compare this film version to it but i have seen and love the us version also entitled `postman even better is this gem from italy which i have read was `mutilated in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime well no matter what is left is a fine piece of cinema apparently the forerunner of the neo realist movement in film making one can certainly see why despite whatever harsh editing did go on a pervading sense of societal and cultural as well as personal oppression remains hanging heavy over the protagonists who therefore face many limits in life consider gino the young drifter not well educated unemployed and resorting to stowing away stealing and conning people in order to get by his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless in giovanna he sees a way out yet he should have kept going as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money her job working at the trattoria for her husband slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen and her sex in the past she had limited options and decided to marry the restaurant gas station owner giuseppe bregana played by juan de landa anyway knowing that he would not make her happy she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches her on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part which he has in fact pocketed gino wins bregana s favor promising also to fix the broken water pump water symbolizing life or lack thereof and is left alone with giovanna they immediately start a heated passionate yet volatile love affair gino soon feels stifled by the relationship and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband wanting no part of it gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford kindly paid for him by another gypsy type man named spagnolo a fellow train passenger to gino spagnolo represents a sort of freedom and they become friends spagnolo also symbolizes gino s morality and conscience traveling and finding work at a carnival together finally gino has steady employment to his dismay he is not yet over his love for giovanna a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go `back home to live and work with them again as he is handy to have around too weak willed to resist knowing this will reunite he and giovanna gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple after a while he gives in to gina s demands to get rid of her husband once the evil deed is done giovanna becomes more cold blooded than ever seeming to have very little conscience while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm as much as he wants to leave her he does again briefly they are now inextricably linked and must face the consequences i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into gino s life to act as a judge of his misdeeds that was very good and interesting adding another dimension to the story while the u s version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters especially the cops and the lawyers ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone this gives the final outcome even more potency and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live a minor quibble the amount of time hardly any that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers how quickly they kill the husband there is no botched first attempt as in the u s version gino s very quick to escalate relationship with the dancer hooker they quickly profess their love as well and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met all rather unrealistic isn t it i found this time frame problem quite distracting it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere otherwise well worth the viewer s time the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout recommended 
this is a haunting powerful italian adaptation of james m cain s novel the postman always rings twice directed by the great luchino visconti what is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it s source material to become something bolder and more original interestingly camus also credits cain s novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel the stranger the film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of cain s narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender cain s very american novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness the lead character cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a mexican and embarrassed that she married a greek immigrant which is not relevant to the italian rural context that visconti is working in this allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate doomed love affair of the two main characters this film is a complex suspenseful rewarding experience 
watching ossessione today more than decades later is still a powerful experience especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how italian filmmakers changed movies forever roughly from ossessione and de sica s i bambini ci guardano both up to years later with fellini antonioni pasolini visconti makes an amazing directing d but taking the uncredited plot of the postman always rings twice as a guide to the development of his own themes it strikes us even today how ahead of its time ossessione was shot in fascist italy during world war ii think about it it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters and the fact that it used the plot of a famous american novel and payed no copyright didn t help ossessione alarmingly reveals poverty ridden war time italy far from the idealized italy depicted in fascist telefoni bianchi movies but it s also extremely daring in its sexual frankness with shirtless hunk gino massimo girotti who definitely precedes brando s kowalski in a streetcar named desire taking giovanna clara calamai a married woman to bed just minutes after they first meet we watch calamai s unglamorous matter of fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between gino and lo spagnolo elio marcuzzo a very appealing actor his face not unlike pierre cl menti s who was shot by the nazis in at years old in a few words sex lust greed and poverty as relentlessly as it had rarely if ever been shown before in italian cinema all the copies of ossessione were destroyed soon after its opening it was called scandalous and immoral visconti managed to save a print and when the film was re released after the war most critics called it the front runner of the neo realist movement preceding rossellini s roma citt aperta and de sica s sciusci some other critics perhaps more appropriately saw ossessione as the italian counterpart to the poetic realism of french cinema remember visconti had been renoir s assistant especially marcel carn s quai des brumes and le jour se l ve and julien duvivier s p p le moko while ossessione may be neo realistic in its visual language the depiction of war time paesan life in italy with its popular fairs poverty child labor prostitution bums swindlers etc the characters and the themes were already decidedly viscontian he was always more interested in tragic passionate obsessive greedy characters in social political sexual apartheid in the decadence of the elites than in realistic everyday life characters and themes favored by desica and rossellini in ossessione we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films especially senso visconti s definitive departure from neo realist aesthetics and rocco e suoi fratelli even in his most neo realist film la terra trema he makes his fishermen rise from day to day characters to mythological figures ossessione is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again from their first to their last opus no matter if the scenery background or time setting may change visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are well obsessively recurrent ossessione is not to be missed you ll surely be fascinated by this ground breaking powerful film 
when i started watching the show i said oh no it s as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody and indeed the setup is almost identical with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him but this is where the resemblance stops the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few the magical setup is a bit corny because it s about seven people with seven servants fighting for the holy grail all servants being someone famous half of all masters being from the same school rules of engagement etc however this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script i actually watched all episodes in one day and without comparing it with animes that i liked more but were from other genres i have to say that i was very pleased 
i have to agree with everyone else that has posted i watched it quite a while ago but i ll tell you whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling i got when watching it and it does make me cry such a happy yet sad feeling i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn t explain things properly but it didn t ruin any part of the viewing experience i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research and watch the ending a few more times and i found all my answers and a whole lot more i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more i ve always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely i d recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characters some mysterious and a bit of fantasy action also even though this was based on a h game it doesn t have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way i have no problem with mature anime in most cases i prefer it 
when i first heard about this series on animetv i have to say that out of all the shows that i have seen this one tops it all off i had to see this show and that is what i really did when i got the first volume of this show it was the best i really liked the animation and all the fight scenes were awesome i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were saber and archer and of course i also like illya and of course all the episodes on the volumes were interesting and very cool another thing i have to say about the series is michael mcconnohie famous for transformers and others playing the voice of berserker he does have a cool character and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume so if you to see something good then see this show it s the best 
this movie is great if you enjoy watching b class movies that is this is a classic college s slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack a horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives kinda funny if you ask me 
the combination of the superb black and white photography and the eugene onegin with a twist plot made this a real knock out for me the atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping there was a superb moment where where transparencies apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly were shown accompanied by lensky s heart wrenching aria from the tschaikowsky opera eugene onegin for me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere last year in marienbad is a good example of such a film krisana is in the same mould 
this is a lovely tale of guilt driven obsession matiss on a lonely night stroll in riga passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing he passes by without a word only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act and then only too little and too late the film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman on a troll of local bars he finds her pocketbook he pieces more and more of her life together his look changes as his obsession grows he has to make things right in a marvelously filmed dialog with the bastard ex boyfriend he forces alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel haunting long takes a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt barking dogs footsteps lovely film noir with a lovely twist a good indie ending 
i am normally not compelled to write a review for a film but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair so i feel it necessary to share my point of view krisana or as it was titled at the theater i saw it fallen follows matiss a lonely latvian archivist as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didn t try to stop from jumping off a bridge as well as her reasons for doing so that s the plot in a nutshell but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act as a detective who investigates the incident tells him we usually don t bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die comparisons to michaelango antonioni and his blowup will most likely abound in any review you read about krisana the influence of antonioni s philosophical and austere style and the story of blowup are clear and in fact writer director fred kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge or at least who he thinks did the only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the college film class look and sound of the film he or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist latvian film most likely faces but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of matiss the background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a fellini film whether or not that was kelemen s intention the filmmakers undoubtedly had little money but this constraint is used to the film s advantage krisana succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self serious it could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt if you are more concerned with plot this film and its ending may frustrate you otherwise take the time to be engaged by it it is well worth seeking out 
a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i m tired of the same old stuff in movies a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i m tired of the same old stuff in movies a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i m tired of the same old stuff in movies 
i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family i found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions the scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create i found the film to be delightful 
jake s closet has the emotional power of kramer vs kramer combined with the imagination of pan s labyrinth even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to pan s labyrinth but this is a story that takes place in modern times not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today jake s closet is about a boy an only child practically alone on summer vacation dealing with his family falling apart it s a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense a horror movie for the thinking person if you re looking for a slasher movie this won t be your cup of tea but if you re looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting this is the movie for you at the screening i saw i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed i highly recommend catching this film 
i saw this at dances with films and it was awesome i really felt for jake talk about adding insult to injury not only are your parents getting divorced but there s a monster after you it was both heartfelt and scary there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film except that the story was actually good and that s what separated jake s closet from the usual indy film pabulum an excellent script with compelling characters also by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama the movie gets the best out of both genres and avoids the clich s of both if it s not coming out in theaters definitely get the dvd 
i used to watch pufnstuf every weekend when i was about it was on right after bay city rollers i saw it come on to family channel one day and taped it for my then three year old daughter i d forgotten all the things i d loved as a child the magic flute the zoom broom witcheepoo s makeup this show is decidedly low tech the mayor is surely a precedent to mayor mccheese and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes but kids love this stuff they would way way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high tech computer animation there is mild slapstick but no adult themes such as sex or people dying and kids accept jimmy s schemes kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought witchypoo was flying overhead the music is old but you really get used to it and my daughter really loved it she used to sing different is hard different is lonely in the car my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about months and it s still one of her favourites i see that a new pufnstuf is in the works i really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don t do anything like computer animating characters etc i think a whole new generation would love pufnstuf 
pufnstuf is what it is i saw this in the cinema at age and i have very fond and vivid memories of it seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience like the bit where jimmy s grey witch wig is ripped off and witch hazel cass sneers i knew she had brown roots it is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time and in some ways quite progressive the track different for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself not running with the pack and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different this could be an anthem to the gay community it should be great track martha raye cass elliot and billie hayes are all great as witches and the living island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits includes billy barty felix silla and other famous names there is a lot of over acting in this film there s really nothing subtle and when little jack wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of living island it s really little more than yelling this is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel while i think of it i never could stand the flute though i love the soundtrack especially the above mentioned different but also zap the world pufnstuf and even jack wild s touching if i could what s more it is now out on cd from the tasteful people at el records in london see here for more www cherryred co uk el artists pufnstuf htm
i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid i cried every time i watched it it wasn t weird to me i totally identified with the characters i would love to see it again and hope i wont be disappointed pufnstuf rocks i was really drawn in to the fantasy world and to me the movie was loooong i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them the acting i thought was strong i loved jack wilde he was so dreamy to an year old when i first saw the movie not in i can still remember the characters vividly the flute was totally believable and i can still feel the evil woods witchy poo was scary i wouldn t want to cross her path 
this film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for tv but it is one of the best movies i ve seen the film and its actors won several awards it is gripping fascinating and it will absorb you completely the story of a chase for a killer in iron curtain russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction but it s ostensibly a true story i highly recommend it 
steven rea plays a forensic scientist thrust on the job in sovie russia in in the very first hours of his job a body of a murdered girl is brought in he has his workers go back to look for evidence and they bring back five more bodies this starts the story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in modern day history it is a stark depressing dark movie that explores how the bureaucracy of the old soviet union indirectly contributed or caused the deaths of many of the killers victims it also explores in donald sutherland s character how the proper usage of bureaucracy in a communist govt can help achieve the ultimate goal of finding a monster a gripping movie not for all but for those who like a good detective story that will hold your interest this is definitely a must see on a scale of one to ten 
excellent film the whole picture was filmed in budapest so i feel proud my little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the hungarian state railways m v and it is plain to see that they were used in big train not in the local railway according to the story chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations apart from this the film is superb 
this is a fascinating account of the hunt for the soviet union s first known serial killer i had tuned in just expecting a half decent tv movie but found myself drawn by the compelling way the story was told as others have said there is much to admire here that is sadly lacking in many big screen releases much of the credit must go to chris gerolmo whose intelligent screenplay and direction draw the viewer in until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved the acting by the whole cast is also superb especially that of the two leads stephen rea and donald sutherland their convincing portrayals give their character arcs a great deal of credibility and the scene where they have their first committee meeting after perestroika is genuinely touching if you prefer your crime films with a bit more depth and a little less sheen i strongly recommend you look out for citizen x 
the poor dvd video quality is the only reason why i gave this movie a instead of a that could have been so much better this movie deserves it this is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously if you do not like movies about serial killers but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former sovjet union this movie is a must see anyway i can t compare it to silence of the lambs for several reasons the way the serial killer is portrayed has been done far much better in citizen x you see several details of his private life because you travel along with the killer which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration the only other movie i have seen that is as realistic as this one was henry portrait of a serial killer if you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen x 
i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun this is a great cast of characters many big names in it a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now i think it s a great idea if you follow any of these actors or have loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well done comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue kind of odd spontaneous appearing comedy with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors the movie did a great job at giving you some insight perhaps even very realistic into the culture of a daytime soap 
chris gerolmo took care not to simply give us a `jack the stripper type of list of murdered people he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results perhaps mostly due to stephen rea s excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both it was the playing of these two parts above all which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of rostov supporting actors especially max von sydow carried out their parts really well good directing the photography was good too needless to say the fact that the film was shot in hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations but frankly given the depth of the story telling and interpretations we can completely forget these little trivialia for once a made for tv film from hbo has come up trumps recommended especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes which i hasten to add are never exaggerated 
though i saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me stephen rea s depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving his anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable everyone in the cast is amazing from sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers i think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers 
imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends year s of his life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself the murder technique is clear but a government unwilling to admit the truth let s a monster destroy dozens of lives when i think my job is stressful i merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick the devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by rea the comic and almost tragic at times relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last years the catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat while not nearly as well advertised and talked about as silence of the lamb s the plot was just as suspenseful rent or buy this movie today 
rea sutherland demunn and von sydow in a small role are all brilliant in their performances sutherland is particularly adept at this sort of role where he must portray a character whose morality is at first uncertain to the audience as is so often the case with sutherland s characters we must ask is he a villian [in this case a minor one] or a hero this is a disturbing story intelligently told about the incompetence and fearful bureaucracy in the old soviet union that impeded the efforts of extremely competent people as sutherland s character wryly notes the measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions the committee meeting between rea and sutherland s characters after perestroika is enforced with its revelations has enormous emotional impact you can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system the handful of dramatic scenes portraying victims family members adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story this is seldom a feature of a film with this sickening subject matter but effectively reminds us that the victims had lives and were loved this is a sad but very important film which deserved its showcase on canada s history television 
okay let s start off by saying this film is not an exact rendition of the crimes and legal pursuit of andrei chikatilo while it may have been official policy in the politburo that the ussr had no serial killers in actuality the legal system had handled others and killer x as he was actually called was already being sought when fetisov brought burakov onto the case in fact as soon as it was realized they had multiple murders on their hands the authorities assigned a task force of dozens of officers to track down and end the killing spree of a man that did not fit into what is perceived as normal serial killer parameters it s good the director and writers consistently remind the viewer that the story is only based upon actual events for a docudrama this ain t spoilers follow that said this is a damn good example of a fast paced hollywood style thriller that still gets across the basics of what happened it is easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of events to make for compelling viewing yes chikatilo raped and murdered both children and adults both male and female yes shoddy lab work set him free to continue killing for years yes innocent men were accused of the murders and confessed to their crimes at police urging yes the gay community was harassed while the crimes were being committed albeit with burakov s committed assistance and yes chikatilo was brought to confession not by the haranguing of the special prosecutor gorbunov but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named bukhanovsky though gorbunov was really nowhere near the egotistical martinet portrayed in this film quibbles about truth and veracity aside all of these events are dramatized in a manner that consistently tightens the tension and fear it doesn t hurt that director and co writer chris gerolmo has a pitch perfect cast stephen rea s growing emotional involvement in the killings and developing expertise in detecting clues donald sutherland s snarky manipulation of the soviet party hacks and subtle spine that becomes evident when it is needed jeffrey demunn s seething undercurrent of rage hidden by a fear filled demeanor max von sydow s boyish excitement at being part of a criminal investigation all enhance the sharp dialog and crisp editing in ways that cannot be underestimated taken for what it is citizen x is almost pitch perfect the almost due to one moment of self congratulation at the end that just does not fit highly recommended as fiction well told not fact being presented but considering the junky serial killer movies that hollywood usually spits out that s good enough for me 
a superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious russian serial killer andrea chikatilo magnificent performance from stephen rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the russian government in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society the film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in russia which is subtly put across there is a conflict of old ways and new ways and these are represented by the two viewpoints of rea s superior played by donald sutherland and rea himself these are at first polarised with sutherland high in system looking down and rea low on the ground looking up however they have a common cause to catch the serial killer throughout the film the relationship between these two develops and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie rea and sutherland and rea and sutherland have mutual respect for each other the killer is caught and glasnost symbolically comes excellent script further credits go to sutherland s performance which is superb and sympathetic jeffrey demunn as the killer whom we despise but can t hate and max von sydow who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help 
a surprisingly complex and well crafted study of the first serial killer in the ussr set in the days of perestroika this intense piece is brought to full life with the performances of stephen reah and donald sutherland this examination of cicatillo as a killer is well rounded and by hinting at some of his behaviors while out right showing others there is a subtlety that is compelling without being overtly graphic not for the weak of heart however as it s subject matter is often disturbing but necessary to it s full development of the main participants in this fact based story hbo has furnished us with an excellent film in an unusual manner congrats to the director and editor of this great piece it is in my top must see list 
there i was sitting alone in my flat on a saturday night with the choice of watching citizen x or the eurovision song contest and for the benefit of americans reading this i ll explain that tesc is an annual event where musicians from countries all over europe and asia minor have a song contest at the end of the contest countries vote to see what the best song was it s a contest that is even less exciting than it sounds and it may not come as a shock when i say that singing and songwriting isn t of the calibre of lennon and mccartney and i should correct something in the first sentence of this review because the word choice is misleading because being a music lover i wasn t going to watch tesc under any circumstance so i sat down as the credits rolled for citizen x expecting a run of mill serial killer whodunnit but i d be misleading everyone calling it that it s obvious within the first minutes of citizen x whodunnit what the film does is point out the failures of communism a serial killer comrade this is the soviet union serial killers can only exist in decadent imperialist capitalist systems this farcical attitude goes far beyond denial there s a scene where an undercover cop sits in a freezing train station keeping an eye out for potential suspects whilst wearing his police jacket because it s the only warm coat he s got and of course all suspects who are members of the communist party are released without interrogation something which will affect the final death toll all this is very well done as we are shown that it s the communist party system that s on trial but about two thirds of the way through citizen x we find ourselves in as communism is on its last legs and reforms to the police investigation have taken place it s at this point that the film becomes rather uninteresting due to a lack of political subtext and the film descends into an average manhunt film but don t let that put you off citizen x is an intelligent thriller well played by the cast especially donald sutherland as a paternal police chief strangely enough a few years ago i read something written by the famous criminologist colin wilson in which he said something along the lines that serial killers let themselves get caught so that they will be the center of attention in the media spotlight and i found myself almost sympathising the party chiefs denying there could be a serial killer in the soviet union after all media is controlled by the party and anyone who s old enough to have listened to radio moscow or read english translations of pravda will know that the ussr only reported news stories like potato harvests coal production and thank you letters from afghanistan cuba etc for soviet assistance the concept of becoming a serial killer in a communist system is illogical but i guess if a tree falls in a remote siberian forest it will still make a sound even though no one is around to hear it 
here s an oddity a modern day film about a serial killer that has no fight scenes nobody seen dying no car chases and no loud noises and it takes place in russia there are only two short action scenes but they are horrific the rest of the story is detective work and how much red tape the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders this is a very somber movie and somber best describes the personality of the hero stephen rea as well yet the story is not depressing and it s very interesting all the way through rea is outstanding as the determined harried looked detective jeffrey demunn is downright scary as the killer donald sutherland s russian accent is suspect but he plays the only character in this film that has some warmth once again the story is dotted with liberal agendas here and there with not one but two references to bias against gays the total validity of secular psychology police and government officials being boorish crude bigoted yadda yadda yadda otherwise it s an intelligent and refreshingly low key crime film this is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well known but is well liked by the people who have seen it since it s based on a true life account of this killer it s all the more chilling don t pass this by just because you haven t anything about it 
this movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion from the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator you ll be entranced it s an absolute must see for anyone interested in criminology interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great not overly done either i recommend it for anyone interested in russian history too how the police work with the political party being what it was it is truly fascinating and frustrating the settings are beautiful it s been a while since i saw this movie the first time it doesn t diminish it s impact not overly dramatic or graphic it leaves enough to the imagination well you ll see 
this has to be one the best movies about serial killers that i ve ever seen and this is coming from someone who absolutely loved silence of the lambs hbo has hit the jackpot here this film is compelling from the first moment until the last this film has so many underlying themes its hard to tell exactly what it is about it chronicles the decade long search for the russian serial killer andrea chikatilo stephen rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation and donald sutherland gives an even more involving performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the russian government willing to help him both of their performances are subtle masterpieces rea begins naive and unwilling to compromise while sutherland begins detached and almost amused by the situation towards the end rea becomes more world weary and beaten by the system while sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic in any other movie i would have said that sutherland s performance stands out above the rest but here even it is rivaled by jeffrey dumann as the serial killer himself dumann brilliantly creates a character here who inspires empathy rather than the hatred we think we would find he is a monster but he doesn t want to be and we get the idea that he is just as disgusted with what he does as we are he is tortured ashamed but vicious as well if you can take the incredibly dark subject matter and it is very disturbing then you should see this movie 
i remember following the case of andre chicatillo in the newspapers while i was living in south africa they had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court not as it turned out to protect the court members but to protect him from the public this was fascinating albeit morbid reading i later heard that a film had been made by hbo about the case but it was made for american tv bummed strangely citizen x got a limited cinematic release in south africa i charged down to the local ster kinekor complex and duly bought a ticket i was alone my girlfriend at the time was only interested in the likes of steel magnolias and fried green tomatoes wow what a brilliant film why wasn t it released to a wider audience had it not been made for tv it could have got an oscar nomination or there is no way to spoil the ending who the killer is is never kept from the audience jeffrey demunn portrays a truly terrifying psycho he is calm downtrodden considered a failure by his wife and subjected to constant ridicule and humiliation by his superiors at work by committing these horrendous acts he gets to feel strong powerful fighting to catch him against all odds is a pathologist played to excellent turn by stephen rea in one of his strongest performances he must battle the snail pace of russian bureaucracy the primitive resources he has at his disposal and above all the refusal by his superiors to acknowledge that the ussr even has a serial killer the general in charge joss ackland says that serial killers are a decadent western phenomenon only donald sutherland is willing to help but his help must be under the counter the ever brilliant max von sydow plays a russian psychiatrist who breaks protocol and decides to help the investigators in their quest it is the first time in russian history that a shrink is used to build a profile of a serial killer still on the loose and he has everything to lose if his involvement is made public citizen x is brilliantly acted well written and the music and editing only add to the tension and theme of the film excellent support from a horribly underused imelda staunton and a real sense of impending doom make citizen x a film worth seeing this was too good to be made for tv
although the word megalmania is used a lot to describe gene kelly and sometimes his dancing is way too stiff you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show in american in paris he choreographs some outstanding numbers some which stall the plot but are nonetheless amazing to look at check out gene kelly s getting out of bed routine for starters gene kelly stars as a gi who is based out of paris he stayed there to paint soon he is a rich woman s gigolo but he really loves someone else hoary story sure but the musical numbers save the show here i really loved georges gu tary s voice work in this one his stairway to paradise and his duet with le gene on s wonderful is s marvelous oscar levant and leslie caron i can take or leave all in all a pretty good but not dynamite movie 
the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy gershwin tunes and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant kelly was at his best here it s a little different to singin in the rain and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor no wonder the sequence ended that s entertainment after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by 
what makes for best picture material the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come it wasn t because hollywood was against art or creativity the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative minds the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar winning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before freed aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a best picture freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the s musicals the point about freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of hammerstein or lerner don t have to tell or even relate to the stories what s important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals the other two being singin in the rain and the band wagon which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story the words don t fit the plot but the routines fit the show so when gene kelly sings i got rhythm he hasn t even got a girl yet but the way it s done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point an american in paris also uses the rule breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie caron s character and what better director for this project than minnelli himself a painter and a pianist at this time there wasn t really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades minnelli s colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red during oscar levant and georges guetary s meeting in the caf a few more vibrant shades are introduced then during the first musical number by strauss minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red a table cloth a bunch of roses until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the picture s colour scheme for most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people however in some numbers such as tra la la he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated the achilles heel of an american in paris is its story i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the s the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero even if you don t mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances compare this to singin in the rain which doesn t really have as many great routines or memorable set pieces as an american in paris but it has a winning storyline singin in the rain was overlooked at the oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all encompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tear jerking but like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show 
this is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers gershwin and a nice parisien atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm but in terms of a story well it s not really there or at least not very well worked out the acting is also not so smooth by caron but i liked some of the dialogues i liked the scene at the seine i liked the character played by levant the colors and the dancing of course which is quite magnificent a seems on the dot to me 
an american in paris is a wonderful musical about an american painter living in paris for inspiration he meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and she believes she can get his work to be even more popular to the public e g in a museum golden globe nominated gene kelly as the artist jerry mulligan is just perfect at both singing and especially dancing he also meets the main girl lise bouvier leslie caron who is engaged to his best friend he can t help his feelings for this girl even after he finds out who she is engaged to filled with nice romance and wonderful song and dance this is a very good musical film it may drag slightly with his dancing dream sequence i e the american in paris ballet but there is a good happy ending it won the oscars for best art direction set decoration best cinematography best costume design best music scoring of a musical picture best writing story and screenplay and best picture and it was nominated for best director for vincente minnelli and best film editing it was nominated the bafta for best film from any source and it won the golden globe for best motion picture musical comedy and it was nominated for best director for vincente millenni liza s father gene kelly was number on the movie stars and he was number on years stars men i got rhythm was number on years songs the film was number on years of musicals it was number on years passions it was number on years movies and it was number on the greatest musicals very good 
if i remember ira gershwin the lyricist and brother of george offered the gershwin catalog for this film and it was snapped up by the producers in many respects it was a typical s movie musical by the freed unit at mgm and directed by vincente minelli with a lot of help from gene kelly the gershwins were of course among the greatest of all broadway musical teams but in my opinion george himself was among the greatest of all american composers period gene kelly was of course one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical one guess as to the other and i don t imagine his casting was ever in doubt but i think the rest of the cast needs some explanation oscar levant was a noted personality in his time and as an actual friend of george gershwin he had to be in this film he was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and hypochondriac and here as always he plays himself leslie caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the french gamin type a talented dancer she was never a real beauty george gu tary who plays the part of maurice chavalier oops i mean henri baurel was greek and not french but he certainly is more than ok as a french boulevardier even if a little too young for the part gene s hoofer s voice is serviceable here but gu tary has much the better vocal equipment though gene was better cast elsewhere as obviously in singin in the rain where his character is much more calculating even here he shows himself to be something of a heel at times he was not for nothing cast as the original heel joey in pal joey the broadway musical i was not so enchanted with his i got rhythm scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinion i also found nina foch s character milo to be rather irritating but the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great french impressionist painters i found it difficult to believe gene and oscar as struggling artists and i don t think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but on balance the gershwin music is very well served in this film the dvd is well done with fine clear graphics when they are supposed to be and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow 
 oxford mississippi at least okay the paris we get is paris culver city apart from the establishing library footage of the real mccoy but it is paris in spirit than which nothing nowhere is better okay kelly is no astaire but then who is and caron is no hepburn ditto but alan lerner is light years ahead of the vastly overrated comden and green who scripted kelly s other big s musical singin in the rain a curious replication of lyricists writing screenplays featuring songs by other lyricists and just to balance things the gershwin numbers are far superior to the arthur freed nacio herb brown numbers so alan lerner didn t have to feel too outclassed the story needn t detain us any more than the anomalies kelly hasn t got change of a match and is a painter i e bohemian yet he is able to scare up a perfectly good suit at a few hours notice when foch invites him to dinner at her hotel in the well documented love is here to stay sequence the lovers are strangely unmolested by passers by other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally free of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic this is after all a feelgood musical so it stands or falls by the score and in this case it stands four square as feel good musicals go it s definitely in the top 
when i was a kid of i always watched movies and television that i wasn t supposed to and this was one of them it s one of my favorite movies of all time and it has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life the acting is excellent they don t make comedies like this anymore these days movies that are actually funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomit inducing body fluid as in those retarded judd apatow movies starring unfunny non actors like seth rogen barf this movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the accolades 
an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly watch as gene sings acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations some purely majestic others pure corn one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before singin in the rain he is definately one of the all time greats it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films especially in kelly s characters the only main difference being that one is based in paris the other in l a some have said that leslie caron s acting was less than pure perhaps cyd charisse who was originally intended for the role could have done better however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly oscar levant s short role in this film gave it just what it needed someone who doesn t look like gene kelly filling the role as the everyman isn t an easy task yet levant did it with as much class as any other lead the song and dance routines are all perfection even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without seeing that there really wasn t much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you d spent four hours with them ingenious i would have to rate this film up with singin since it is very similar in story and song singin would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performance full recommendation stars 
while the story is sweet and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy the uniqueness of the film and what makes it a masterpiece is the dream sequence it features the combination of the highest form of truly american music gershwin the engaging beauty of french impressionistic art kelly s enthralling choreography including his rapturous pas de deux d amour really a separate genre with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist 
i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli it won two academy awards for best picture of and best screenplay the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel leslie caron his main dancing partner and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise famous french singer georges guietary sings too so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar levant s nimble piano fingers the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem 
i enjoyed this film it was lighthearted delightful and very colorful you can see that mgm was showing off technicolor there are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film every scene is packed full the choreography was great gene kelly is a wonder he is so talented the dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed he understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else the last section of the film the grand dance sequence is very impressive what makes this film very special is gershwin s music few american composers have had a better gift for melody i very much enjoy gershwin s music it is enchanting ira gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers he is so witty and charming this was a highly entertaining film 
there are few comedies like this where almost every line and every character come close to flawless this is soooo funny and it has quite a bit of satire there to sally field is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good if not perfect job with her daytime tv diva sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top but of the time she is a riot in the same league is kevin kline robert downey jr and whoopy goldberg who unfortunately has too little to do here downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time but he struggles with his part which is to be honest the most ungrateful one but the shining star here is cathy moriarty as celeste a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret you will see in the absolutely stunning finale sadly elisabeth shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part i normally like ms shue but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie but it is not something damaging and for the most part she is at least adequate otherwise brimming with memorable lines and situations this is a comedy to watch whenever it is on tv or wherever 
i felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film s page because some of it was slightly misinformative originally i posted quotes from the original poster but i wasn t sure if it was proper given that this is the comments index and not a message board though we used to use em that way back before imdb added the film message boards so i will edit this to make it unnecessary well first of all you may not be aware of this but gene kelly first became famous for playing pal joey on broadway in the original production when vincente minnelli decided to make a gershwin panorama film he wanted kelly s character to be more sophisticated than the goody two shoes roles he had been playing in most his films with the exception of for me and my gal alan jay lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in paris based on the story of pal joey this gave kelly a chance to play his famous role from broadway even though warners had outbid mgm for the rights to pal joey in my opinion the wb film pal joey is a wreck though sinatra was suitable for the role but other problems sunk the film script changes and poor direction you complain that kelly s pictures are not well done even citing your art education to prove the point but you miss the fact that kelly s bad art was clearly designed to be bad and it is necessary for the story characters the pictures are so bad the audience knows that kelly isn t ready for an exhibition even he knows it though milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her but it s important that the audience not be sitting there saying but he s a great artist if he only had the chance you want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show again you are not understanding the structure of the story he refuses because he doesn t want to feel like a gigolo and because he knows he s not really ready for the exhibition his enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as joey s enthusiasm to start a nightclub but it serves the same function in the plot remember it s essential in pal joey the play that joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesn t deserve it same with the art show if kelly s paintings were actually good it would undermine this whole point then you complain that caron and kelly have no chemistry i guess it s in the eye of the beholder i agree the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be but for me it was fine compare it to even worse forced romances like the one between cary grant and sophia loren in the pride and the passion when you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film it just shows that you haven t dug beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism it s about finding love enjoying love then losing love he looks around and his love is gone the movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationships if you didn t see that it s not the movie s fault it s certainly not a load of crap 
i saw an american in paris on its first release when i was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway i went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times i have seen it since both in the cinema and on tv it makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century george gershwin and features the greatest male gene kelly and female leslie caron dancers in hollywood history the supporting cast of oscar levant as quirky as ever georges guetary why didn t he make more movies and nina foch brilliant in an unsympathetic role are at the top of their form the closing ballet superbly choreographed to the title music makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of paris and of the images of impressionist and post impressionist artists all the gershwin songs are beautifully staged but the most memorable are it s very clear caron and kelly on the banks of the seine and i got rhythm the kids of paris joining gene kelly in une chanson americaine if you love paris see this movie if you ve never been to paris in your life see it but see it 
gene kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with mgm here he s at the top of his creative powers working with the arthur freed musical unit hard to believe when you watch an american in paris that the players never left the back lot at mgm the magic of an american in paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of vincent minnelli and the sets that mgm designed blended with some background establishing shots the idea of the film originated with kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving george gershwin s tone poem an american in paris it sounded good to arthur freed who approached ira gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other gershwin material gershwin got the kind of deal for gershwin music that irving berlin normally got not one note of non gershwin music is heard in an american in paris listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like embraceable you and but not for me which are not real musical numbers another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics alan jay lerner wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one all about an ex gi played by gene kelly who after world war ii never left france just settled into an apartment on the left bank and proceeded to become a starving artist he lives with eccentric composer oscar levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy two women are interested in him another expatriate american played by nina foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he ll reciprocate in other matters but kelly falls for a shop girl played by leslie caron in her film debut caron also has musical comedy star georges guetary interested in here of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of george gershwin an american in paris happens to be the first film i ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip i ever took i still remember flying back from phoenix arizona to kennedy airport seeing gene kelly doing i ve got rhythm my favorite number in the film however is tra la la which kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with oscar levant playing the piano at one point kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano in a book about arthur freed i read a quote where he said in the american in paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the french impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot so it happened that way kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in words and music the pirate and on the town but this one topped them all still does in my opinion and that includes some of gene kelly s later films in a surprise upset at the oscars an american in paris was chosen best picture for beating out the heavily favored a streetcar named desire i guess fantasy trumped realism that year big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well still an american in paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof something less likely to be repeated 
vincente minnelli directed some of the most celebrated entertainments in cinema history he was among the first hollywood directors to show that a profound love of color motion and music might produce intelligent entertainment american in paris is the story of an ex gi who remains in france after the war to study and paint he falls in love with a charming gamine lise bourvier their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the city of lights itself the whole movie brings a touch of french elegance where technique artistic style and music all come together in perfect synchronism the first musical sequence introduces the exciting personality of leslie caron in her screen debut she is like a diamond a touch of class george guetary describes his fianc e ambiguous grace in a montage of different dance styles sweet and shy vivacious and modern graceful and awesome the number leads to an unpretentious bistro where kelly and his very good friends in paris share a gentle parody of viennese waltzes later kelly celebrates a popular tap dancing with a crowd of enthusiastic children singing with him i got rhythm and at the massive jazz nightclub kelly spots the girl of his dreams he is instantly hit by her sparkling sapphire blue eyes and only one clear thing is in his mind to pull lize onto the dance floor and sing to her it s very clear our love is here to stay to the joyful tra la la kelly provides humor wit and talent all around oscar levant s room and even on the top of his brown piano when he meets his pretty cinderella along the seine river kelly is swept away by his happy meeting with caron he expresses all his emotions with our love is here to stay the piece had a definite nighttime feel as the two lovers were bathed in soft blue smoky light they start an enchanting dance duet juxtaposing differing elements caron dances with her head on his shoulder then tries to run away in a fluid way they move backward away from each other then pause to rush toward each other for a little kiss and a warm hug the film s weakest numbers were those that bear little relation to the story in one georges guetary performs an entertaining stage show with showgirls in giant ornaments floating down to the stage in another oscar levant imagines himself conducting a concert and playing not only a piano recital but the other instruments as well he even applauds to himself as members of the audience the extravagant climactic super ballet of the film is quite an adventure a breakthrough in taste direction and design it is a blaze of love fury and vividness it is kelly s major fantasy of his lost love and of his feeling about paris as viewed through the huge backdrops of some of france s most impressionist painters the number starts at the beaux arts ball after kelly finds himself separated from lise and begins a sketch with a black crayon it gathers the important parts of the film s story through a constantly changing locations all in the style of the painters who have influenced jerry the tour richly attractive and superbly atmospheric includes the place de la concorde fountain the madeleine flower market the place de l op ra to his rendez vous at montmartre with the cancan dancers in a representation of lautrec s moulin rouge kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self caron seems to dominate her space and sweeps you away to another time and place nina foch appeared very attractive and elegant in her one shouldered white gown in one of the film s most famous lines kelly asks her that s quite a dress you almost have on what holds it up nina cleverly replies modesty an american in paris garnered six oscars including an honorary award to gene kelly the film gave us a wealth of memories to take home 
etienne girardot is just a character actor the sort of person people almost never would know by name however he once again plays the coroner one of the only actors in the philo vance films that played his role more than once i ve already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air this film also is great to watch because in addition to girardot there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride including grant mitchell gene lockhart henry walthal kent smith h b warner and nat pendleton this is quite an impressive cast and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia bruce these great character actors are one of the big reasons i love these old b movies while the mystery itself is rarely that terrific because of the breezy writing and acting the films really satisfy as for this film vance is played wonderfully by lowe but like i said the mystery itself is only an after thought with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicides unfortunately you cannot hypnotize anyone to do anything of the sort i have training in clinical hypnosis and if i could do anything like the evil guy could do in the film i would have done it used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets overall while not the best philo vance film it was very good and it s a darn shame lowe only played this role once in fact aside from william powell who played vance five times the series was hindered by a long long succession of actors such as basil rathbone wilfred hyde white and warren william and many others playing vance this is a similar problem that also plagued the bulldog drummond series just too many different actors playing the leading man well worth seeing and exciting though also quite impossible 
when philo vance edmund lowe is standing precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city apparently hypnotized and just about to step to his death it immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine years later the woman in green in which sherlock holmes basil rathbone is similarly about to hurl himself into space while being hypnotized happily both philo vance and sherlock holmes survive these attempts at murder by unscrupulous criminals exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes when will they learn you can t cloud the minds of great fictional detectives 
i have been a fan of this movie for years and years because of teri hatchers move into the forefront i had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it why people back in did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me sally field and kevin kline are beyond fabulous although i never have watching daytime soap operas this movie kills me every time i watch it the acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart i highly recommend that you watch this if you haven t already you will get to see elizabeth shue whoopi goldberg teri hatcher and carrie fisher to name a few all give splendid performances 
s s van dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with hollywood most of the film series from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios but apparently van dine must have sold his rights to each book about philo vance one at a time note that paramount mgm warner brothers and more all released philo vance films only tarzan seemed to get around hollywood more mgm produced the garden murder case and starred edmund lowe as the fashionable detective of course mgm had the screen s original philo under contract at the time but bill powell was busy doing the thin man at the time and i guess louis b mayer decided to concentrate him there edmund lowe is a pretty acceptable philo vance lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with what price glory and then with a string of films with victor mclaglen with their flagg and quirt characters but after mclaglen got his oscar for the informer lowe seemed to fade into the b picture market the garden murder case involves three separate victims douglas walton gene lockhart and frieda inescourt the sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished i will say this though vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last minutes are worthy of hitchcock 
nicely and intelligently played by the two young girls mischa barton as frankie and ingrid uribe as hazel although the plot is rather a stretch of the imagination young hazel running for mayor seems out of place to be honest while the acting is well done by all concerned the movie tends to lack a genuine atmosphere of drama perhaps we ve grown to expect gritty reality in movies rather like comparing pollyanna to how green was my valley never mind each of them are good in their own way i do admire joan plowright even if her role is somewhat subdued here middle of the road entertainment well suited for younger viewers and how nice at times to be exposed to fine classical music which is almost a rarity i find this movie to be a welcomed change as it reflects quieter thoughtful values for the growing up years and no violence thank goodness a warm family film to enjoy 
i thought that it was a great film for kids ages a little sappy but the story is uplifting an fresh it proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true i think that it s a great story for any kid who is feelings down or feels as if there trying to juggle too many things among them very cute film bravo 
i first saw this film during and international film studies course i am a non traditional student and perhaps for reasons of years lived or wisdom accrued appreciated the slow reflective pacing of the film s narrative languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime the story is deeply psychological replete with multi layered symbolism and an articulate inversion of the theme of being the other in a land that one does not understand the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider made nearly years ago it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered much more lavishly filmed and heavily financed works that have been made since reflect the same themes indochine nowhere in africa are two that in comparison perhaps make chocolat seem pale and boring it has no adrenaline pumping action or extreme violence the struggles are mental emotional and subtle but that being said it is a fine film worth a viewing 
claire denis debut is both a brave and self assured one in this depiction of life towards the end of french colonialist cameroon she explores the relationships between men and women black and white with the black servant prot e as the film s primary object of desire and oppression the film enters taboo territory from the beginning denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed to the screen the mood of the film is captured perfectly by the camera work and lack of lighting a great discourse 
anyone who doesn t laugh all through this movie has been embalmed i have watched it at least twenty times and i still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes sally field is absolutely perfect as celest talbert a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise fields at still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children i m biased i m in love with her the cast of soapdish is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection kevin kline is flawless as are robert downey jr an ing nue elizabeth shue whoopi goldberg teri hatcher in one of her early roles carrie fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on kathy najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer and best of all cathy moriarty as nurse nan who leads the plot to get fields character removed from the show is hilarious this movie should have won oscars for best comedy best leading lady in a comedy best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests including writing directing and supporting actors and actresses get the dvd so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years you will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out 
this movie shows life in northern cameroon from the perspective of a young french girl france dalens whose father is an official for the colonial french government and whose family is one of the few white families around it gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated it s a sense consistent with another movie i ve seen about africa in a similar time period nirgendwo in afrika but i have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is it s not just an impression things do happen in the movie but the plot is understated the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers forced upon him although the framing of the story as a flashback from the woman s visit to south western cameroon as an adult provides some perspective 
the story is about a little girl growing up in colonial africa but it is so much more than that anyone growing up in the south would experience the same things a longing for another one of a different race that cannot be consummated even a glance is forbidden there are no words needed their facial expressions say everything it is the story of a black servant prot e isaach de bankol and a white woman aim e giulia boschi their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other the little girl france c cile ducasse is lonely and spends all her time with prot e she really can t see this dance one of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials they cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves there world is about to end they just don t know it yet their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence i think i would like to visit this africa it seems so quiet especially at night when you only hear the animals 
set in the cameroons in west africa in the s claire denis chocolat is a beautifully photographed and emotionally resonant tone poem that depicts the effects of a dying colonialism on a young family during the last years of french rule the theme is similar to the recent nowhere in africa though the films are vastly different in scope and emphasis the film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country france dalens mireille perrier a young woman traveling through cameroon recalls her childhood when her father francois cluzet was a government official in the french cameroons and she had a loving friendship with the brooding manservant prot e isaach de bankol the heart of the film however revolves around france s mother aim e giulia boschi and her love hate relationship with prot e that is seething with unspoken sexual tension the household is divided into public and private spaces the white families rooms are private and off limits to all except prot e who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower outdoors exposing their naked bronze bodies to the white family s gazes it becomes clear when her husband marc fran ois cluzet goes away on business that aim e and prot e are sexually attracted to each other but the rules of society prevent it from being openly acknowledged in one telling sequence she invites him into her bedroom to help her put on her dress and the two stare at each other s image in the mirror with a defiant longing in their eyes knowing that any interaction is taboo the young france cecile ducasse also forms a bond with the manservant feeding him from her plate while he shows her how to eat crushed ants and carries her on his shoulders in walks beneath the nocturnal sky in spite of their bond the true nature of their master servant relationship is apparent when france commands prot e to interrupt his conversation with a teacher and immediately take her home and when prot e stands beside her at the dinner table waiting for her next command when a plane loses its propeller and is forced to land in the nearby mountains the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located each visitor shows their disdain for the africans one a wealthy owner of a coffee plantation brings leftover food from the kitchen to his black mistress hiding in his room another luc jean claude adelin an arrogant white frenchman upsets the racial balance when he uses the outside shower eats with the servants and taunts aim e about her attraction to prot e leading her to a final emotional confrontation with the manservant chocolat is loosely autobiographical adapted from the childhood memories of the director and is slowly paced and as mysterious as the brooding isolation of the land on which it is filmed denis makes her point about the effects of colonialism without preaching or romanticizing the characters there are no victims or oppressors no simplistic good guys prot e is a servant but he is also a protector as when he stands guard over the bed where aim e and her daughter sleep to protect them from a rampaging hyena it is a sad fact that prot e is treated as a boy and not as a man but bankol imbues his character with such dignity and stature that it lessens the pain because of its pace western audiences may have to work hard to fully appreciate the film and denis does not in roger ebert s phrase coach our emotions the truth of chocolat lies in the gestures and glances that touch the silent longing of our heart 
despite the patronage of george lucas this captivating and totally original fantasy in lumage a combination of animation through live action cut outs is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by ralph bakshi in his heyday brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape shifting dog ralph one of a duo of bumbling rejected heroes synonamess botch the hilariously foul mouthed villain and rod rescueman the pompous novice superhero breathe life into a uniquely clever concept frivoli vs murkwood or the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares in this context the mor infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do it s a real pity therefore that i have had to watch this via a truly crappy looking boot culled from a tv screening of the uncensored version there is also a milder variant that toned down the language for its vhs release since the film is otherwise unavailable on dvd interestingly both henry selick and david fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacities 
you ll probably never see it but the uncut version is about better than the one you can buy put it another way once you ve seen it in its original form the current version is only half as good it s still wildly creative and sick a total success on so many levels 
one of the most unheralded great works of animation though it makes the most sophisticated use of the cut out method of animation a la south park the real talent behind twice upon a time are the vocal characterizations with lorenzo music s carlton from tv s rhoda woody allen ish ralph the all purpose animal being the centerpiece the accidental nightmare sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed 
ok as far as the versions of this movie there were people involved in the making john korty and bill couterie george was just the producer he really didn t have any kind of say so in the film just helped with money the adult version was made possible by bill couterie john korty didn t like or approve this version as it was done behind his back thanks to ladd films going under they didn t advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for the right stuff hoping it would pull them through and it didn t so this movie never really had a chance when twice made it to cable hbo they showed the reels with bill s version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore did you notice how the adult version wasn t on for very long showtime got the clean version the version on the videotape and laser disc is the version approved by john who holds more power than bill it s a pity really as the adult version is actually better and does make more sense but it s very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd or any other format short of bootleg sorry to disappoint everyone i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club still have numerous items from the movie used to own a letter boxed version of the adult version but it was stolen only have a partial hbo copy of it now stars to the adult version to the clean version any other questions just ask 
i don t watch soaps my grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass i made fun of them it when i was ten it was so easy but this movie takes parody and spells it a new way i found the story pretty damn funny the fashions of the s shoulder pads sequins and polyester just top it off the huge hair the high heels and the histrionics what a combination and all the actors just go to town chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile sally kevin elisabeth wonderful whoopi great robert downey refreshing to see him back when he had such potential before the tabloids and garry why did we have to wait so long to see him on film leesa gibbons hadn t been missing her but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter and where do you apply for that job anyway admittedly i could have done without sally climbing the drainpipe lucy ricardo did it how many times as has every comedienne from carol burnett to i don t know who and i m so done with it now i could spit peanuts if i had them apparently it s what you do when you re being funny in a tall building in new york i m just thankful they didn t pull out the flagpole bit but it was cute it was funny it had plot twists it had an after credits ending before that was common it had clothes worthy of a second glance it had a great cast and it s got personal memories for me really what more do you need 
i went and saw rivers and tides again today it s the second time in two days and yes i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and goldsworthy s works this morning when i threw the coins i received the abysmal water goldsworthy has an affinity with water hence the title i received the th line changing which moved to the army to blake art was a war anyway i knew i had to see the film again i read one of the few reviews extant online from the sf examiner the critic loved the film but said goldsworthy s comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film he d rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack so i was aware of that as i watched this second time yesterday i thought that i d vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say could i enjoy the film without his comments what he is doing what he is saying goes way beyond art his understanding of water time stone change and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar some of his work words are zen like his knowledge anyway the film is only apparently being shown here in the bay area be a trend setter go to your local cinema and tell them no insist that they have to book a film you ve heard about from the hinter lands it s called rivers and tides 
as a person who sought out an existence as a professional person with income backed by a bs in chemistry and ms in business management my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic my post post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography stained glass ceramics metal forging welding and art drawing that also included silk screening i also keep healthy with jogging walking and lately hiking to remote destinations in california and nearby states like utah arizona and nevada jogging walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds within that background i was obsessed with rivers and tides i was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist andy goldsworthy as well as the skills and smoothness of director cinematographer thomas riedelsheimer i actually could not separate the art of goldsworthy with camera path of riedelsheimer wonderful wonderful wonderful 
 so not being a poet myself i have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary the effortless motion of goldsworthy as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating watch him stick reeds together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze knocks down the entire web the genius of goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself it is in the essential change of nature where his work though complete in its own sphere is made whole 
this film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity an artist s profound vision his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring hosanna blending his creations with trees white water dashing against rocks fields and rain andy goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth he doesn t spare us his occasional frustration but on the whole we see the miracle in joining art with nature credit also goes of course to the filmmaker thomas riedelsheimer who directed photographed and edited the movie with incredible sensibility and perfect timing if you have any feeling for beauty nature and art do not miss this fantastic film 
i first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it s initial release back in and it really had a profound effect on me so much that i bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings the bottom line none of my friends walked away disappointed ever this stellar film is about scottish conceptual artist andy goldsworthy who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials wood water flowers rocks etc to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form a statement in the temporary state of everything we get to see goldsworthy create several works of temporary art as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world as well as a few pieces in the natural world as well german film maker thomas riedelsheimer directs photographs edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye ear with an ambient musical score composed performed by fred frith who s music is generally edgy experimental noise textured guitar as well as a capable ensemble of musicians although this film has been available on dvd for some years now if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film by all means seek it out it s easily a film that was composed for the large screen with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way no mpaa rating but contains nothing to offend unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb 
this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that i ve ever seen on screen andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it s primitive in a good sense his purity honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art i was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end sometimes prematurely but his scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that goldsworthy s art has it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself fred frith s score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect it has no boundaries as far as age goes 
the scottish artist andy goldsworthy fashions natural materials into ephemeral artworks assembling rocks into egg shaped cairns filling riverside rock pools with fiery flowers and stitching thorns and twigs into intricate web patterns an original work and a few photographs of his other creations are tucked away in a corner of southampton art gallery near where i live but although i found these pieces intriguing i only realised the wonder of goldsworthy s work when i was lucky enough to catch a re screening of rivers and tides thomas reidelsheimer s film accompanied by a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by fred frith brings goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work the opening scene captures him fusing icicle fragments into a snake like thread set atop a tree stump working with his teeth and bare hands goldsworthy crafts a beautiful ephemeral work before long this delicate sculpture melts away to nothing in the brilliant nova scotian sunlight this scene is among the most beautiful in the film but the breadth and inventiveness of goldsworthy s work is remarkable reidelsheimer shows both the successes and the failures capturing the frustration of pieces that collapse before they are completed as well as the glory of those that shine even if for just a few hours minutes or seconds goldsworthy himself provides the narration speaking slowly but thoughtfully about the themes in his work he makes plain his need to work with nature to be alone in it and to further his understanding of it through trying to work with natural materials even when they seem to be working against him at times he is down to earth and humorous at other times he struggles for the words to express his purpose something which is quite understandable when witnessing his astonishing work first hand the rivers and tides of the title become increasingly pertinent as we see the natural materials pass through the artist s hands flowing from one form to the next the capture of the creation and dissolution of goldworthy s work is in itself a striking piece of art although goldsworthy works with widely varying materials and covers territory across north america and europe the presentation of artworks one after the other in this film is exhausting it gave me the same feeling of fatigue that i get when i spend too long in an art gallery and struggle to take in anything new a brief interval in which we are introduced to andy s family and hometown is all that breaks the long succession of his artworks nevertheless reidelsheimer does a superb job in photographing goldsworthy and his creations locating them in their wider environments from meandering canadian rivers to rainy scottish hillsides fittingly the film ends with goldsworthy casting handfuls of earth and snow into the sky fleeting patterns emerge from the dust particles even as they dissipate into the air this is the purest expression of the beauty to be found in the work of this remarkable artist 
andy goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order expressing the way through his sublime ephemeral art indeed time and change is what his work is fundamentally about i bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times so it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all he is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone if they do anymore creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it mr goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways and always with the utmost respect gratitude and humor of a wandering and wondering monk 
greetings again from the darkness insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist how strange for most of us to see someone who must work no matter the conditions else his reason for living ceases to see goldsworthy s sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic this artist creates because he must not for money or fame it is his lifeforce when you see his failures energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon it is not the dread of beginning again it is that he takes his energy from his work watching him create just to have nature takeover and recall his work is somewhat painful but nonetheless breathtaking he discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same when he says he needs the earth but it does not need him i beg to differ only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best 
i saw this film at the rhode island international film festival and was completely blown away the structure and execution of the film was fantastic i know it won t but it really deserves an oscar nod cal and andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates yes the film is very controversial and i can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers however despite its harsh and blunt subject matter zero day is so worth watching i m looking forward to it coming out on video so i can buy it it s very very good very powerful and intense the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it s almost too realistic their uncertainty the recordings the footage and panic of the students totally indescribable i really hope it gets the attention it deserves it s done in the same format as the blair witch project handheld camera made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film but god is it infinitely better very impressive hats off to everyone involved if you ve got the chance you really should see it 
what is most disturbing about this film is not that school killing sprees like the one depicted actually happen but that the truth is they are carried out by teenagers like cal and andre normal kids with normal families by using a hand held camera technique a la blair witch ben coccio succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some issues with high school although we aren t ever told exactly what is behind those issues they seem to be typical a lot of people hate high school so what a part of you just doesn t believe they will ever carry out the very well thought out massacre on zero day the surveillance camera scenes in the school during the shooting are made all the more powerful for that reason you can t believe it s really happening and that it s really happened the hand held camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie a brilliant idea given the subject matter 
this is the best movie i ve come across in a long while not only is this the best movie of its kind school shooting the way ben coccio the director decided to film it was magnificent he filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school he filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary it is almost artful if that is indeed a word there are a few slip ups however for example when cal calls brads land rover a range rover or vice versa it s been awhile since i ve seen it 
this movie is about a fictional soap opera it is very fast and funny to say anything else would ruin the movie there are several plots and sub plots in the movie this movie has ensemble cast with today s hottest stars they all gives over the top performances this movie is favorite of mine from the year soapdish is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera or prime time soap opera if you watch soap go check this movie it s hilarious 
everyone knows about this zero day event what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were they showed their life for about a year throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what they re gonna do and that gives me the chills cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comments and i just thought cal was a sweet guy even though i knew what was gonna happen you know even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of or i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off of course i was i got to like them they were wicked maybe but i felt like they were really normal guys that they didn t really realize it but i knew they were that s imo the main force of this movie it makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we won t even notice it this movie as good as it was made me feel bad and that s why i can t go to sleep right now there s still this little feeling in my stomach butterflies 
as a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school shootings this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea presented as a series of video recordings made by the two troubled men i cannot refer to persons who kill as boys or teens the months of preparation leading to zero day the codename for the day on which they will attack the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun it seems intent on portraying the pain they suffer yet focuses on the literal preparation the problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered the only point at which emotion became overwhelming was the ending as expected but leading up to this point it s never really clear as to why they are planning this out we are told the obligatory story that they were mocked but the film also seems to contradict this without ruining the film it s easy to say it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions but falls short because of sloppy film making all directing is amateur to further the homemade video concept but the story and continuity is weak the film seems to want the audience to decide a lot but also fails to provide the information for such an event the ending is abrupt and doesn t feel like it finishes everything that the film began 
in my honest opinion everyone should see this movie at least once it really put things in perspective as i watched it though it was fictional this movie is about something that could happen to your children it shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school and their plans to murder innocent students this film would not have worked in any other format they pulled off the hand held camera perfectly it reminds us of april th when eric harris and dylan klebold murdered students and then themselves it also reminds us of the media storm that followed after everyone wanted to see the rampart video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes this movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true we get to see the kid behind the monster the only bad thing about this movie is that it did not do well on the market and few people even know it existed if it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about zero day i believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it the shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film because it mostly focuses on cal and andre and what they did up to that point if you have not yet seen this movie go rent it and watch it i guarantee that when it is finished you will be speechless 
i just came back from the montreal premiere of zero day and i m surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie basically the blame is about coccio doing an easy and overplayed social message well mr i m a reviewer it s an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social charge not that i want to expose my life here but i come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go reject ignorance on the menu thing is i understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror high schools have became battle fields of conformity it s a real ugly sight you need to fight your way into being like the others it s hard to explain bit a lot of people dosen t realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence meanwhile parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect the real motive of the movie isn t about what is driving them it s about this death like calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town cal expressed it well it s a wake up call drama is everywhere and it can take every shape in that case little dramas like andre being called a faggot for wearing a j c penny shirt are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town andre cal took the most extreme way to express their pain the malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted i like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of andre cal like if with the pain they communicated cal andre have communicated their blind rage to their community their refusal to think about the causes of some acts it might seemed aggressive as a movie but coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating what andre cal are living is a reality and a scary one that might get to other kids disturbing movie home making and strong feeling made ben coccio do a very very disturbing movie 
saw this movie at the rotterdam iff you may question some decisions of the maker like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject but this movie sure hits you in the gut especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch hope it gets the distribution it deserves

i watched this film many years ago and have searched for it ever since in my opinion although very raw it is very educational as to what the future can hold i enjoyed the movie and to this this day rate it very high sorry to all those that disagree but a movie should always be judged each to there own and in my opinion its great give it a go with all the cloning and test tube babies that are happening today who are we to judge this film this may be a dramatised event of what is to become but there you go all the horrors of today are so far fetched even i laugh but this one gets me thinking and it scares me as a mother what if i was desperate after watching this movie i would think twice sorry but i love the movie make your own mind up don t watch the movie making just aknowledge the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child 
the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia brooke adames bradley marshall jeff hayenga who have tried for the last five years to conceive virginia has had two miscarriages since then is desperate to have a child they visit dr richard meyerling james karen for help after he is recommended by some of their friends dr meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child dr meyerling operates on virginia it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success virginia is pregnant at first everything seems perfect the marshall s couldn t be happier but their picture perfect lives don t last for long as virginia s pregnancy develops problems she becomes moody acts totally out of character she receives a worrying phone call from beth jane cameron another woman who has undergone dr meyerling s procedure who claims that meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her produced directed by rodman flender i actually thought the unborn was a decent horror thriller it s definitely not a sci fi film as the imdb would have you believe that pleasantly surprised me the script by henry dominic tries to be different it must take some credit for that at least the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares bad special effects it s got quite a clever story that works plays on basic human fears it moves along at a fair pace although it s not exactly an action packed film by any means the climax was good seemed a fitting way to round things off the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then maybe flender knew something the rest of us didn t on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times also i have to mention it what on erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh director flender does an ok job the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it s good enough the atmosphere is good there s a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her dr meyerling s sinister plans aren t fully revealed until the last possible moment disappointingly the blood gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt i ll remember too much about it technically the film is ok i d imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but it s well made even if it s a little bland forgettable the baby creature is actually a decent special effect has fairly realistic facial movement the acting is good this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends star lisa kudrow i have to be honest i don t like friends i don t even know who she was in this so i can t tell you how she did the unborn is a good horror thriller that deserves to be more widely known seen it s far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves if your a horror fan are looking for something a bit different something slightly more intelligent thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn followed by a dumbed down sequel the unborn ii which i watched straight after this check my review out if you want 
the unborn is a roger corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless if you hate pregnant women check out this movie because it s chock full of preggo killings and failed abortions brooke adams stars as virginia her and her square of a husband go to some fancy fertilization clinic because they can t have kids on their own there they meet dr meyerling james karen of rotld dr meyerling has had a very high success rate at getting couples pregnant insert joke here is it because he s creating some genetic killer supermutant babies that s what virginia starts to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme moodiness from the treatment that s when she starts taking matters into her own hands on this one you ll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else because if i told ya all the goodies this one had you might hurt yourself putting it on your netflix rental queue too quickly it s a bit slow moving for a while but once it picks up in the final third all systems are go very highly recommended by me on the strengths of its un pc fetal violence out of seventeen stars 
love this film also saw it when it was first shown i n germany in a small independent cinema in frankfurt it was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to the erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with moritz boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that in his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie it doesn t exist much copies of that film mortitz boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for tv as well before he became a sort of therapist for the people who wish to see that movie again you could find it on his homepage which isn t that easy to search for but its possible 
this is one of the very few movies out there which are very erotic without being pornographic despite there being only a very rudimentary plot there s not much live sound or dialogue instead the actors do voice overs describing their experience why they participated etc it s a document it s mind blowing i can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this there already is something like this this nb the producer doesn t have the rights to distribute a dvd version i ve also never seen it being sold anywhere one may email mr boerner and order a copy on vhs 
since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed this show was a s version of the poplular s tv series x files but with a bit more of a comedic light hearted approach but don t get me wrong some of these episodes have full on horror themes many in which have some pretty greuesome plots left to the imagination of course this was the early s television some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting but that is the charm and attraction to this series whether you like mystery crime dramas comedies or sci fi horror themes this series brought all that together each episode clocked in at around minutes or so hour with commercials and that minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more a great classic show that is underrated in my book 
kolchak is sheer entertainment great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down darren mcgavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him simon oakland jack grinnage and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having some excellent guest stars add colour and verve to individual episodes erik estrada in legacy of terror phil silvers in horror in the heights antonio fargas in the zombie it s easy to see how a boyhood spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files darren rip simon rip ruth rip 
there are two distinct ways to enjoy this snappily written seminal tv show the godfather to x files and buffy etc as a monster show it scared the hell out of me when i was a kid or as a well written acted gumshoe film noir it works on both levels the scariness may have been diluted over the years it was made in the mid s but i was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show via dvd that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons the late darren mcgavin is karl kolchak an eccentric tenacious rumpled newsman monster hunter who in pursuit of a story always finds a supernatural angle much to the pain of kolchak s over stressed put upon boss tony vincenzo played with tremendous world weariness by the also late great simon oakland you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers the interplay between these characters is crackling and witty much like star trek s spock and mccoy only more acidic over the course of two pilot tv movies and a one season series kolchack fought vampires robots werewolves witches zombies government conspiracies aliens and ancient legends sounds like the entire yr run of the x files in one season and kolchak did it first and as for composer gil melle s cool partly whistled main title music well x files creator chris carter calls mike snow s very similar x files main title theme an homage both themes work well leave it at that and unlike many modern horror sci fi shows most of kolchak s monsters are shown in shadow and in quick cuts effectively and sometimes thankfully as some of them do not hold up to modern scrutiny but some still do modern horror shows take note less is more one of the few flaws of the show and it s a small one is the over use of sunny california locales passing for windy city chicago night gallery had the same issue unavoidable for a modest budget l a based show and some of the supporting characters seem to fall into what are now viewed as clich s the effeminate reporter ron updike always used for comic relief sweet old lady advice columnist emily but they all do have their moments to shine unlike many supporting tv characters since clich or not kolchak is a timeless show that serves as a template for many that followed and carl kolchak is one of the richest characters ever written for a horror genre tv show agent mulder s real dad and as a footnote i tried watching a few episodes of the new re imagining of the show it s an x files clone a copy of a copy and a bad one at that carl kolchak is now a model pretty angsty something played dismally by a boring stuart townsend and giving him a scully type partner is also a lame idea it undermines kolchak as a lone don quixote crusader and kolchak and vincenzo getting along where s the tension the interplay that they chose to hang the kolchak name on this regurgitated bit o crap is a prime example of how not to do a remake take a beloved cult series scrape off everything unique about it drain it of all character and color but keep the name need that cult cred and voil instant re hash it gets an f in re imaginings this new version deserved the axe stick with the short lived but classic original it truly gets better with age 
a couple of years back i had purchased and enjoyed the mgm double feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies the night stalker and the night strangler when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out i had intended to buy it immediately but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd s kept me from adding it to my collection recently i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak discer as well having watched it now i can safely say that i didn t regret acquiring this beloved if short lived crime horror series one bit it may follow a standardized formula dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak marvelously played by darren mcgavin gets into everybody s hair with his attitude flustered editor simon oakland long suffering colleagues assorted authoritarian figures a plethora of monsters and villains faces up to the inevitable and usually supernatural threat alone but finally is pressured into keeping his story under wraps but a winning one further boosted by an impressive line up of guest stars and notable behind the scenes credits making the show a great deal of fun that said quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired for instance the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment not to mention the fact that these were restricted to minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes in the case of the werewolf again he s never seen biting anyone but somewhat foolishly is made to merely throw people around while the hero s cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots there s a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode often but not exclusively revolving around mcgavin s relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere the setting for the most part is chicago and suspense to make the ride even more pleasant there s a bouncy score by gil melle and jerry fielding for the record the monsters encountered but not always defeated by kolchak throughout the series are a revived jack the ripper a variety of cults voodoo native american aztec aliens vampire werewolf going round its over familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise liner doppelganger satanist swamp creature mass of electricity robot apeman witch headless motorcyclist succubus a knight s armor taking a murderous life of its own the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast featuring john dehner as a morose police captain hans conried and robert emhardt helen of troy and crocodile some of the actors other than those playing kolchak s co workers return in the same roles keenan wynn and ramon bieri both as officers of the law john fiedler as a shrewd morgue attendant and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero if i were pressed to choose the finest or most entertaining episodes i d lean towards horror in the heights co starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer and the afore mentioned the knightly murders while as the weakest i d go for the werewolf due to reasons i ve already explained and chopper based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob gale unfortunately the set contains no extras it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak the night stalker as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci fi series popular today in fact kolchak himself in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise returned in a revival this version is available at my local dvd rental outlet but for various reasons i m not sure i d want to check it out so soon after the classic 
 kolchak was a tv series that really didn t fit into any category part horror part comedy some social awareness thrown in and what we have is something that i think people weren t ready for it s a shame really as i ve started to watch these shows on the chiller network i never saw the originals i realized how different and interesting it really was starring darren mcgavin as kolchak a reporter for the international news service and simon oakland as his always angry boss tony vincenzo the show followed the exploits of a chicago news reporter who more often than not became a part of the story himself as he searched the windy city for modern day creepies that go bump in the night the underlying charm of macgavin really sets the show apart a somewhat goofy guy who always wears the same suit you cannot help but love him his jokes are great and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor oakland are downright hilarious the stories are for the most part pretty good and the acting is very good the s were not a great period for special effects and the show suffers for it but if you suspend disbelief what you have is a fun series that was ahead of it s time 
i loved kolchak the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle hey where s the soundtrack guys and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level when darren mcgavin s carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations he reacts like most people would he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger he is frightened even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode it s rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force he s usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works sometimes he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are in one episode he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly he must go back and defend himself he s heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn t do but that doesn t mean he probably wouldn t much rather someone else did it instead of him he s a regular guy doing a job trying to make a buck not a monster hunter he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural which he has an interest in but he doesn t want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do if his plan to defeat the creature didn t work you will often see him running for his life to get away from it which is of course what i would do in the situation that s why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him you were scared for him and for the other characters too the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it s all for naught if you don t care about the characters darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a monster of the week show and he decided not to continue i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but as an adult i can see why it couldn t go on in that formula for very long i still love the episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling determined and brusk but good hearted reporter for the ins known as carl kolchak i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show it s not the monsters darkly lit sets creepy music or goofy guest stars although they are all vital ingredients the secret to it s success is right there in the title kolchak the night stalker without mcgavin s lovable bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for then it just ain t a night stalker 
when originally screened in america in the night stalker became the highest rated made for t v movie in history based on jeff rice s unpublished novel it told how a fearless investigative reporter named carl kolchak the late darren mcgavin discovered the existence of a vampire in modern day las vegas when it arrived on british television four years later it did not quite have the same impact but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning as indeed was i we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen i did not know of the existence of the night strangler until it turned up nearly a decade later i t v who screened the kolchak movies had apparently decided to pass on the spin off series they felt barnaby jones starring buddy ebsen to be more of a draw and anyway viewers might confuse kolchak with kojak for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in fangoria magazine i could not even purchase the jeff rice novels then something wonderful happened in b b c put out the show as part of a late night friday series devoted to the supernatural called mystery train hosted by richard o brian kolchak found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of the brain eaters and earth vs the spider the opening titles were trimmed removing kolchak s whistling and the closing credits well there were none the first episode screened was werewolf i cannot say i was overly impressed but stuck with it and am i glad that i did i really wish i d seen it in my twelve year old self would have adored it creepy humorous exciting no wonder it fired chris carter s imagination the show s biggest asset was of course mcgavin unlike the recent kolchak the original was an everyman figure eccentrically dressed rather conservative he was to the supernatural what columbo was to crime the late simon oakland was great too as kolchak s bad tempered boss tony vincenzo the scripts overflowed with wonderful dry wit i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror when the twenty episodes ended i felt bereft the x files came along a few years later and filled the void but only to an extent i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back i am glad that the show was never revived though without oakland it would not have been the same i have the rice books now and have read them several times i was very surprised when stephen king slated the first in his book danse macabre as it is as good as anything he has written alright so some of the monsters were hardly state of the art but so what the new kolchak totally missed the point of the original what you don t see is sometimes more frightening than what you do best episode horror in the heights worst episode the sentry 
not the most successful television project john cleese ever did strange case has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made there are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones but the story as a whole unfortunately doesn t add up to much arthur lowe is a hoot though as dr watson bionic bits and all good lord 
you can do a lot with a little cash blair witch proved that this film supports it it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity however because it has john cleese as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn t afford a shoestring the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere bumbling watson his dimness and slowness foils cleese s quick tempered wit if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two 
the quintessential road movie if your idea of a road movie involves three would be magicians with eastern european accents and claire forlani well one out of four ain t bad a no talent magician with an eye for showmanship max watches a very skilled pickpocket hugo plying his trade in new york after convincing hugo that he max is a mental and b desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive the not so dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions milo and the ah gentler attributes of a lovely waitress lydia the unlikely four pile into a van obtained by hugo you guess where it came from and head to vegas havoc ensues anyhow it s funny it s well written and the ending is surprisingly good a solid comedy with a warm heart and all the better that it was totally unexpected 
i have wanted to see this for the longest time james merendino is a great director slc punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this film i thought that it was a great follow up after that though it begins to drag the acting and direction were terrific in fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script at times the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world claire forlani this film was good but i expected more p s look for great cameos by chi mcbride and chris mcdonald 
this movie is awesome for three main reasons it is esthetically beautiful i absolutely loved that there is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets a photography which looks very costly and probably was not completes the look i always enjoy those stories about groups of misfits loners coming together and becoming a family sometimes they fall into clich s but this one does not this group of actors really portrays well flawed yet extremely likable characters alan larkin is the best between him the van and the road movie theme i could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year little miss sunshine i discovered fabrizio bentivoglio very interesting actor and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by til schweiger performance at times the opening scene all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny there is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film i like the end a lot and of course it is all about the magician theme a good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to to create an illusion which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and that s why they call it movie magic 
miriam hopkins is the lady with red hair in this biopic of mrs leslie carter which also stars claude rains as david belasco richard ainley as lou payne and a fine cast of supporting players including laura hope crews and victor jory miriam hopkins and claude rains give wonderful performances hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for mrs carter rains is great as the flamboyant egotistical producer writer actor impresario david belasco one of the great names in theater though mrs carter s second husband lou payne served as adviser on this film it s a poor representation of the real events of mrs carter s life true there was a much publicized and bitter divorce and she was undoubtedly viewed as a scandalous character for that and for becoming an actress however she had custody of her son dudley so there was no custody battle once she broke with belasco she did not go back to him and in fact started working in vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of her life she did indeed marry lou and he became her leading man in many productions the driving force for mrs carter in the beginning of this film is regaining custody of her son but she finally realizes that in her time away from him he is thoroughly bonded with his father in the film also and i m not sure if it was true in real life she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house which gives the film some added interesting atmosphere not a bad movie probably not a depiction of the greatness of either carter or belasco one of mrs carter s most famous moments was in the heart of maryland where she wore a wig with six foot tresses off stage fans blew her hair as she hung feet above the stage clutching the center of a bell to keep it from ringing quite a visual 
i had seen lady with red hair back when it appeared and didn t remember it as something to cherish the truth is that notwithstanding its base in a true story its screen play is silly and unbelievable the real merit of the picture is the cast a constellation of some of the best supporting players of the s and s make a background for the delicate intelligent work of the always underrated miriam hopkins and the wonderful spectacular performance of claude rains who as usual is the best thing in the picture what an actor he never won an oscar but he is in the good company of chaplin garbo and hitchcock perhaps lady with red hair contains his best work in films see it and enjoy him 
the scene where sally field and whoopi goldberg go to the mall to revive sally s flagging spirits is enough reason alone to enjoy this movie but wait there s more this is a crackling good sendup of daytime tv movie stars on the way down and up and the horrors of love robert downey jr shows the lighter side of his genius and cathy moriarty is splendid the dialogue is witty and the physical humor done with consummate skill this is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting directing and writing 
a group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick up truck mirage is obviously inspired by spielberg s duel and craven s the hills have eyes still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore the film s gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck there is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk and slash sequences the acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak but the film is fast paced and shocking b g steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening the desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong overall if you like low budget horror films give this one a look out of 
i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie it was my first horror movie maybe that s the reason why i can still remember some parts of it i don t remember much about acting nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head todd schaefer kenny johnson and kevin mcparland i also remember the last scene when jennifer mcallister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck it s a movie that gives you the creep and it s worth a look but where do i find it how can i download it 
well this was one of those films i caught on the off chance and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time if like myself you enjoy many s horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm i e not just another glut of generic sequels then i think you may enjoy this when the bad guy eventually turns up in person he was definitely not what i expected to see all in all i wouldn t go out of your way for this one but if you like the genre then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill i guess i d give it out of 
mirage is a very rare horror chiller from released here in the uk on the new world video label it s a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck this film has some creepy scenes and some gore here and there but i have to say that the acting was so lame even by low budget standards but the film was oddly addictive and i liked it and i never fell asleep or turned it off which is always a good sign i nearly gave this movie but seeing as it built up steam along the way had some good moments of gore and suspense had some good nudity and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too i ll give it 
bill crain s rarer than rare slasher movie certainly doesn t follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons a sin that s virtually unacceptable in most post halloween genre pieces but there s still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you ve grown to expect just as wally koz s surprisingly decent was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director looking through the credits i noticed numerous crains listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature but despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert which as i m sure you ll agree is hardly the most exciting location with that said though i must admit that there s certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune like wilderness greg s older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze something that kyle doesn t seem too keen to forget sound like a motive for a massacre well what did you expect before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature i don t even know if director bill crain is aka william crain the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others mirage certainly doesn t appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mine judging by the credible work behind the camera i d have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it s necessary r christopher biggs gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent rating a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck there s also some black humor that s surely unintentional we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer s boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters but when he s revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted s bogus journey i didn t quite know what to expect thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b g steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn t come at the cost of thespian potential the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film making at it s freakiest mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck you have to say that they did a damn good job the flaws are numerous but never detract credibility from the net result unfortunately you ve probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store then make sure you pick it up recommended

matthau and lemmon are at their very best in this one everyone else in the movie are also great the dialogue is excellent and very very witty and the scene where lemmon s character attempts to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time i see it anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original i recommend this wonderful movie to everyone i just love it and the fact the jack lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion these two great guys made a string of movies together but this one is the best no doubt 
the first time i saw this i didn t laugh too much at the time i was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time i had the same reaction when i viewed it a second time a few months ago and this time it was because felix s aborted suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the movie a bit this scene made some of the things oscar said and did to felix later in the movie seem needlessly cruel and their personality clashes weren t as amusing as they could have been had i not already known the story i would have been worried that some of oscar s antics to felix might push him over the edge as it was it didn t make me laugh or smile like the television show with jack klugman and tony randall did still all in all a pretty good movie and it spawned one of the greatest sitcoms on television out of 
neil simon has quite a body of work but it is the odd couple that carried him to fame this film really works jack lemmon walter matthaw have a great chemistry the supporting cast for this film is stellar as well it is about men living together who are from opposite planets the script bristles with humor from this situation this had been done in some forms previously this is the one that brings it all together in a very good package simon has done some other decent work but this one is really his best work which made the rest of his work possible it is hard to imagine simon ever topping this 
the original movie the odd couple has some wonderful comic one liners the entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat freak felix ungar and funny obnoxious slob oscar madison this paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful tv series of all time as well as countless not anywhere near as good imitations the odd couple movie has some wonderful jokes about oscar s apartment and his sloppy habits he says who wants food one of his poker player buddies asks what do ya got oscar says i got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches what s the brown it s either very new cheese or very old meat i also love the line about oscar s refrigerator it s been out of order for two weeks i saw milk standing in there that wasn t even in a bottle there is no question that walter matthau s oscar madison is a joy to watch on screen he s almost as good as jack klugman s version in the tv series the problem with the movie is jack lemmon s felix ungar jack makes a very very honest effort at the role the problem is that he makes felix so depressing and down trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical tony randall s performance in the series brought the kind of humor warmth and sensitivity to felix s character which lemmon s portrayal lacks tony s felix unger obviously could be annoying some of the time however in the tv series it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline jack s felix ungar note the different spelling in the movie seems to never be happy fun or interesting the movie felix ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall all the time the movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time the famous meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever one of the other great examples of felix s little notes on oscar s pillow will be remembered forever however there are some darker sides where oscar goes over the top his crying near the end after bawling out felix and a scene involving felix s linguine dinner although lightened by a funny line seem more depressing than comical perhaps there wasn t enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie the beginning minutes are very boring the same issue occurs with felix s conversation with the pidgeon sisters the movie s ending is predictable and too pat there s very little care or compassion for each of them by the other the result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger rather than comedy unless you are watching the great scenes described above it appears that jack lemmon s monotone persona of felix brings the film down rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters it really took the s tv series to make the odd couple the best that it could be the original film is still very good however the tv series is much better 
i think that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen robert harling s script is near perfect just check out the quotes section on second thought just rent the dvd since it s the delivery that really makes the lines sing sally field gives a comic over the top performance like you ve never seen from her anywhere else and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious robert downey jr is typically brilliant and in a very small role kathy najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue but she s great here as the one real person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of the sun also sets that rumbling you feel beneath you is hemingway rolling over in his grave either that or he s laughing really hard five stars funny funny funny 
the odd couple outta stars like most people i will always feel that jack klugman and tony randall are the definitive odd couple their incredible work on the tv series from the early to mid s was a highwater mark for television at the time easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale nonetheless how can you go wrong with a jack lemmon walter matthau pairing matthau is in especially good form as oscar the slob lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as felix particularly if you have previously seen tony randall s outstanding performance the script is good definitely neil simon s best i will go on record here as stating that neil simon is probably one of the worst most over rated playwrights of american theatre the storyline is simple felix a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with oscar the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats lots of fun and some great one liners 
i don t think i ve really ever given walter matthau his due as a comedic performer he s certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles but i guess i always put his success down to his characters grumpiness and ruthlessness a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co star jack lemmon and i suppose a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures watching gene saks the odd couple adapted from a popular neil simon play the realisation suddenly clicked matthau is in his own right absolutely hilarious initially striking the audience as filthy crude and generally unappealing his oscar madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own at the same time while holding his own as a comedian his interplay with lemmon is of course pitch perfect indeed the film rightly belongs to both actors who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves let alone together calling to mind billy wilder s screenplay for the apartment this neil simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise compulsive house cleaner felix unger lemmon having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years attempts to commit suicide but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window dejected he arrives at the house of good friend oscar matthau a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat oscar kindly offers felix a place to stay but is soon overwhelmed by his friend s finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness the pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement with felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly nagging wife and oscar as the sloppy unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he s supposed to this is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks and by the end of it we can completely sympathise with felix s ex wife who remains unseen the odd couple is a terrific comedy most of all because it has a lot of heart for all their arguing it s obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other most movingly seen when felix tries to launch into a furious tirade instead perhaps inadvertently ending up informing oscar how tops he his the pair s four poker buddies john fiedler herb edelman david sheiner and larry haines are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance but you can t deny that they ve got the best of intentions their decision to treat felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory but maybe being ignored wasn t quite the correct solution to felix s gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays i was recently disappointed by wilder s the seven year itch this film doesn t simply strike at the same chord throughout and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed through tears laughter and much disagreement 
jack lemmon and walter matthau began and ending their career together remember best as the grumpiest of old men as well as the oddest couple to have ever made us laugh lemmon and matthau were one of hollywood s best loved comedy teams of the last years not as raunchy as pryor and wilder instead they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern marx brothers routine such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that marx chaplin and keaton were so famous for in the odd couple lemmon and matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos the physical comedy is as unique as chaplins the joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another not your typical guy film it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime the chemistry between lemmon and matthau is entertainment enough although this movie isn t for everyone this is a great comedy 
 the odd couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation people all know it they hum the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy oscar or a fastidious felix but they re under selling the film without knowing it this isn t just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy it s a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce it s also damn funny from start to finish but it s the kind of comedy that arises from realistic stressful and just plain awful situations so some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable but i think its verisimilitude is its strength besides matthau s bulldog face just cracks me up my favorite comedy by a country mile 
it s very funny it has a great cast who each give great performances especially sally field and kevin kline it s a well written screenplay by andrew bergman honeymoon in vegas i don t like soap operas even though i never watch them but i do love this film because it s so crazy and off the wall that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television in my opinion it s the best film of 
this cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters especially of course the two leading characters jack lemmon plays felix a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she couldn t stand his cleaning and cooking attacks any longer so he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails walter matthau plays oscar his friend an untidy unreliable sports reporter who lives in divorce from his ex wife in a bachelor apartment he offers his distressed friend felix a new home in his apartment and soon the trouble begins because two such contrary characters can t live together for a long time felix turns oscar s disorderly flat into a clean exhibition flat he cleans and cooks the whole time after a short while oscar feels persecution mania filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted above all jack lemmon s play is wonderful he is the perfect clown he makes us laugh but in a tragi comic way look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbours for supper because oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling ball while he is preparing the drinks felix sits with the two young ladies in the living room to get out of this embarrassing situation he starts to talk about the weather a minute later he changes the subject and talks about his ex wife and children suddenly he begins to weep and when oscar comes back with the drinks there are three weeping people in the living room the film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes an intelligent entertaining comedy with much heart out of 
in the s studios would use short films like this one sort of as testing grounds for new actors given their relative ease of production in comparison with full length feature films so it s interesting that this one should star shirley temple who had long since established herself as the most famous child star of all time then again she probably wasn t the one being tested i would imagine that would have been frank coghlan jr who played shirley s brother sonny in the movie and delivered a comparatively less impressive performance then again a year old shirley temple was probably not an easy act to accompany the film opens with an unimpressive sight gag involving a leaky ceiling which i suppose was designed to have shirley temple give a scornful look at the ceiling illustrate the working class status of the family in the movie and provide a clean transition into the next scene which features shirley gleefully stomping in the rain it s sonny y birthday and his father makes occasional and horrendously botched efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give sonny a dog that he really wants for himself but sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten by one once and has been creeped out ever since it s curious that when his father insists on getting a dog sonny decides to run away from home rather than have a dog in the house and as he is running away with no destination in sight it s also curious that the movie illustrates what seems to be an indifference to homeless people that surpasses even the astounding indifference that exists today sonny passes a man cooking bacon in an iron skillet at the side of the train tracks right after a train flew by which given how close to the tracks he was you would think would have blown the guy right off the tracks but no matter after sonny gives up on sharing breakfast due to the sour stare that his gleeful smile receives from the guy he continues on and the homeless guy disappears from the movie it s interesting to consider what a longer film would have done because this one leaves this poor guy as a loose end not that that matters sonny soon hears a dog whining underneath a trestle as he passes over it and jumps down to find a dog covered in burrs it might seem trite that he immediately takes the dog up and adopts it since he just left home because of his fear of dogs but it seemed to me that he just needed to be reminded not of his power over dogs but of their lack of power over him as soon as he saw a dog in need he overcame his fear hey if that s all it takes all i have to do is find a helpless spider and i m set it s a very convenient movie in which everything works out exactly as it is supposed to but it s cute enough and enjoyable enough and short enough as it were to still be a fun movie we already don t expect an epic plot in a minute film but pardon my pups still packs in a substantial amount of story and character development in its short running time and it also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made charlie chaplin proud i am hardly an expert of shirley temple s films but it s not hard to see how she became the most famous child star of all time 
years ago i did follow a soap on tv so i was curious about this movie and i was so rewarded for finding it it s a marvelous spoof of soaps with jealousies the usual actors insecurities and all sorts of lovely excesses but more than anything an amazing cast and an incredible script how did someone get all those top notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie and how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines i never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it but it s marvelous and i highly recommend seeing it sometimes i ll throw it on while doing housecleaning and end up sitting on the couch watching laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing many congrats to all who made it 
 in april the university of chicago agreed to operate argonne national laboratory with an association of midwestern universities offering to sponsor the research argonne thereby became the first national laboratory it did not however remain at its original location in the argonne forest in it moved farther west from the windy city to a new site on illinois farmland when alvin weinberg visited argonne s director walter zinn in he asked him what kind of reactor was to be built at the new site when zinn described a heavy water reactor operating at one tenth the power of the materials testing reactor under design at oak ridge weinberg joked it would be simpler if zinn took the oak ridge design and operated the materials testing reactor at one tenth capacity the joke proved unintentionally prophetic the s plant used convection to separate the isotopes in thousands of tall columns it was built next to the k power plant which provided the necessary steam much less efficient than k the s plant was torn down after the war concerned that the atomic energy commission research program might become too academic lilienthal established a committee of industrial advisers and during a november visit to oak ridge he discussed with clark center manager of carbide carbon a subsidiary of union carbide corporation at oak ridge the possibility of the company assuming management of the laboratory prince henry of prussia arriving in washington and visiting the german embassy evidently with prince henry of prussia according to the principles of science and its dangers their were already concerns with the applications of new science with military applications the hohenzollern ii kaiser wilhelm s splendid yacht at the th st pier new york taken at the exact moment of prince henry s arrival and the raising of the royal standard if royalty knew of these necessary precautions to citizen welfare then what was the necessity of the warfare wwi and wwii the quality of management control i presume thus did the commandos of operation swallow volunteer for a military mission or a business plan based on the security principles of laboratory management because supposedly their were no survivors and the ones who were caught in europe ordered to be executed of the man commando team the survivors who were captured were executed under orders of the german army against subversion and espionage acts of the state of germany the f hrer no g kdos okw wfst f hrer hq oct signed adolph hitler translation of document no ps office of u s chief of counsel certified true copy kipp major declassified dod march reproduced at the u s national archives the oss society whittier ave mclean va 
this movie is a half documentary and it is pretty interesting this is a good movie based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germany this movie isn t perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves if you re interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie that s worth a look 
by saying that i mean that this is not a well made movie but it s a very good version of the real event and the best depiction so far and if you are a ww buff then this is a treat for you cause there are three out of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie it s theater acting at best but then this is still as said before a semi documentary me personally am a die hard fan of our nearly over human heroes of the second world war and there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did so it won t get forgotten by next generations cause nowadays kids doesn t read books they watch movies so if you want a action extravaganza rent private ryan this is the truth about lingering pain outrageous endurance and the will to fight when all seems lost 
this was a really cool movie it just goes to prove that you don t need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie it traverses continents in seconds people get shot and nothing happens to them swords set on fire samuari fight on sinking galleons david essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and john rhys davies is just the dude i enjoyed this movie but i like s t movies this is the perfect example of a very s t movie that just kicks ass if you like battlefield earth you ll love this film its swashbuckling its fast its silly its samuaraitastic it also looks as if it was made in 
i find this movie the best movie i have ever seen because it reflects the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war the movie is impressive not least because it actually happened it reminds me of the story of anne frank 
it sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings by using the adjective shocking i do not intend to imply that i am surprised about the things told about in this film or that i was formerly unaware of them it is just that i am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and incomprehensibly horrific it is to kill each other off either with or without a reason the first part of the film focuses on hanna s successful participation in the hungarian resistance maruschka detmers would never have won an oscar for this performance due to inconsistent directing but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma she is cast very well as hanna and immediately has our sympathy her very beautiful looks help of course but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress playing a good part certain inconsistencies keep occurring in hanna s war i sometimes get the idea director menahem golan often despised for the gianni versace murder was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene on the other hand i am very thankful he made this impressive and thought provoking film and as i am very positive about it i think he did a good job the second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one it focuses on hanna s suffering beware of donald pleasence s scary portrayal of the cruel and sardonic captain rosza and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war i receive hanna s war especially the second half as a strong anti war film and for that alone golan deserves credit it is also this second half in which maruschka detmer s talent comes out creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking strong and tragic ever portrayed it is also great to see ellen burstyn whose appearance and acting style always remind me of romy schneider who had she been alive and cast would have made a similar effective contribution to hanna s war the tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful prospects and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears and when i realized once more it wasn t even fiction it all actually happened i found myself in even more tears the image of hanna portrayed by maruschka detmers will be in my mind forever 
for someone who remembers jane in the daily mirror strip cartoon viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia in that context it is wonderful but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters the plotline is also a bit limp for today s audience but reflects the naivety of the s and s very well jane you must remember was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years created to boost the morale of the troops she gave a double meaning to the strip in strip cartoon the story has something in common with the tales of edgar rice burroughs and rider haggard the theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era a bunch of bumbling nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling englanders and set in the african jungle of course for jane fans a must see for the rest of you a damp squib 
someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing paul naschy s fury of the wolfman to the great spanish surrealist films l age d or and un chien andelou the naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end dali and bunuel probably loved it and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off the film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from a to b to c some mishmash about a professor walterman his first name mind you who was bitten by a yeti monster during an expedition to tibet and hasn t been the same since which is understandable one of his jealous colleagues the insane daughter of the noted doctor wolfstein knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him but its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast walterman flips out turns into a werewolf kills a few people is electrocuted dies is buried unburied taken to a castle filled with circus freaks wired to various machines zapped with assorted electronic effects injected with potent elixirs is chained up turns into a werewolf a woman in an evening gown with thigh high nazi fetish boots whips him he escapes helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe eventually turns back into a werewolf and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife the lady with the nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her luger pistol they die together and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter who did nothing look what a beautiful day it is la furia del hombre lobo was written by paul naschy in a hurry original director enrique eguilez was fired and replaced by jos mar a zabalza a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production he was often unable to work though he did find time to instruct his year old nephew to make some alterations to the script and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of naschy s previous movies mark of the wolfman the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different and helped pad out the runtime after zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie post production was a nightmare nobody knew who was doing the editing the money ran out the master print disappeared for a while and then at a pre release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater he was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb yet somehow the film works if you let it it keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles vaulted catacombs chains whips gloomy moors fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn t make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution in one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning in the next shot its bone dry and he s howling at the full moon then its raining again and yet you don t look at it as a gaffe its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible opposites are the same and effects proceed causes first the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams and then the cable starts sparking with electricity people say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend it is a marvel of making something out of nothing and succeeds not because of what it could of had but because of what it does it s easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it the trick is being able to see through the mayhem or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect paul naschy died last week at the age of he had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more was working on film projects right up until his last days but passed away in madrid spain with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment his rich varied and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like fury of the wolfman in rapt awe even people who don t like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at if only for just a minute in a couple spots you can find it for free at archive org or even buy it on a dvd for a nickel it s worth far far more amusingly naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted sick demented little movie as a classic if not an outright masterpiece of cinema dementia the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him but i will say this i d rather watch fury of the wolfman in its dingiest most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing obnoxious crap churning out up at the swine flu cineplexes this or any other weekend the world lost a great artist this month watch his films and remember 
this movie was great and i would like to buy it the boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe the eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond the boy scares up later the boy shoots a deer that a bully kid was claiming because their arrows were marked very close the same only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer but this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even crueler to him and at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he was please if anyone knows where i can buy this movie let me know i haven t seen it for over years but still remember parts of the movie deniselacey yahoo com
a riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas this film is hilarious admittedly you have to have a taste for films with screaming hysterical dialogue over the top acting and melodramatic plot twists but if you do you re in for one hell of a treat sally field plays celeste talbert daytime tv s queen of misery celeste s cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of lori craven elisabeth shue her long lost niece and simultaneously jeffrey anderson kevin kline splendid as always celeste s long ago lover but celeste has been hiding a deep dark secret and the arrival of lori and jeffrey might just bring it to the surface add in the diabolical montana moorehead a wonderful cathy moriarty in full gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode who is trying mighty hard to destroy celeste s career david robert downey jr the weenie boy producer of the soap who s secretly plotting with montana to ruin celeste and rose schwarz whoopi goldberg scriptwriter and celeste s one true confidant and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute does anyone remember mixed nuts but when done well can be pretty damn funny a major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look field kline goldberg and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm shue is clearly the weakest link here but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by field kline et al moriarty is a stand out in the showy villainess role making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see there are also lots of familiar faces that you ll recognize in small but nevertheless all very funny roles including carrie fisher garry marshall kathy najimy and teri hatcher director michael hoffman keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish mention must also be made of robert harling s screenplay carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera the dialogue is boiling over with great lines delivered brilliantly by the actors i d be willing to bet that a lot of this stuff was improvised look if you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best and having a great time doing it get your hands on this one if not for anything else it will put you in a good mood and make you laugh 
oh the sixties there were some interesting films i was more of a movie goer then i now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater i also saw this short film the legend of the boy and the eagle i have been searching for this film for years it was truly inspiring surprisingly i was finally able to gather more information from your site thank you i m surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a disney picture i too did not remember the disney film i did not even remember that it was an opening film for disney i truly wish they would show this on tv sometime i wonder if disey holds the rights to this film is it available on dvd this is a must see for all generations 
i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of disney this movie has been in my memory for over years and i have been looking for it i would have to say that out of all the kids movies i saw back then this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once i really hoped i would get to see it again the story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory to this day i never did see it after that day back in the s in fact i never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me i loved it and want my kids to see it does anybody know where i can find it 
i have seen this movie when i was about years old which was years ago and i never forgot this movie i was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle and i just couldn t believe it when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die my sister was in the movie with me and i asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it like we saw it only yesterday so it isn t just me this movie is a must see you will never forget it just like my sister and me 
i read so many comments that i too shared about remembering this movie and wanting so badly to see it again but i didn t know the name of the movie thankfully because of doing a search and finding the title on this site i read the comments left here and realized that this was the movie i remembered i then did a search and did find the movie and was so thrilled to be able to watch the movie once more years later because of this site and your comments you helped me and so i want to thank all of you i want to share how i was able to find this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy as well it was on the vhs version of wonderful world of disney s call it courage which contained movies the second one being the legend of the boy and the eagle it touched me now as much as it did years ago and now i own my own copy of it i think it is only available on vhs i found it on ebay and i have seen several copies of it there enjoy it i know i did it is a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he took care of when it was time to sacrifice the eagle the boy set the eagle free because he couldn t allow it to be killed after the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after freeing the eagle the eagle too saved the boy s life and more than that taught him how to survive the closeness that the boy and the eagle shared in the wilderness was so moving and the filming was really remarkable what a wonderful era this was i have never seen anything come even close to this movie 
william hurt may not be an american matinee idol anymore but he still has pretty good taste in b movie projects here he plays a specialist in hazardous waste clean ups with a tragic past tracking down a perennial loser on the run played by former pretty boy weller who has been contaminated with a deadly poison current pretty boy hardy kruger jr possibly more handsome than his dad is featured as weller s arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving natasha mcelhone is a slightly wacky government agent looking into the incident who provides inevitable high cheekboned love interest for hero hurt michael brandon pops up to play a slimy take no prisoners type whose comeuppance you can t wait for the coca cola company wins the product placement award for as the soft drink is featured throughout the production shot lovingly on location in a wintery picture postcard hungary 
the biggest reason i had to see this movie was that it stars susan swift an outstanding and all too underappreciated actress time travel movies usually don t interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft but this movie was fascinating and creepy it didn t rely on outrageous special effects and it didn t focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused this was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all 
i saw this when it premiered and just re watched it on ifc again this is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to hawai i to work the sugar plantations in the early s my grandparents were part of that migration my parents were born on a kohala plantation big island at the time setting of the movie i moved to the big island over a year ago after living in california for over years i was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped with wild cane still growing years after the plantations closed i ve heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation this movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories this story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot driven movie it leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman s some people just don t get it i didn t recall that youki kudoh had the starring role with which she did an incredible job i recall her great performances in jim jarmusch s mystery train and in an australian film co starring with russell crowe heaven s burning tamlyn tomita did a great job with her pidgin english especially for someone who didn t grow up in the islands i had forgotten that toshiro mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator and i missed the fact that jason scott lee had an uncredited non speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene i was saddened to find out that the director and co writer kayo hatta died in an accidental drowning in there are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience gaijin about the immigrant cane workers in brazil many of them japanese in the same time period and sugar cane alley about the cane plantation experience in africa the latter is still available but gaijin sadly doesn t appear to have been shown in quite a while another great film about the early asian in america experience when immigrants were more like slaves is a thousand pieces of gold this was set over the chinese workers involvement in the building of the railroad starred rosalind chao chris cooper michael paul chan and dennis dun 
it s funny it s not arthur miller or t s elliot but man this is funny kline and fields are great her toss off line god you are so disgusting as she climbs in his window great kline s running into the door after scoping out teri hatcher great too robert downey jr and kathy moriarty work together flawlessly until he finds out who she really is a soap opera turn if there every was one the scene near the end in the chinese dining area had my kids and i rolling on the floor that scene alone is worth the rental price doesn t solve any world problems or show the seemy underbelly of daytime t v i hope just a lot of fun 
distortion is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise a sort of multi layered drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that are happening to him right at this moment to be more concise he feels that his wife is cheating on him so he hires a private eye to snoop on him his wife has no idea that this is happening meanwhile the actors in this play are also having a few whoopdedoodles up their sleeves by fooling around with each other and with shall we say unscrupulous people in the world of israel the whole thing culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable but not really happens the director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the ensemble cast of characters and edits in a way that makes you pay attention this is a fun film actually one which i didn t mind viewing and would recommend people check out 
great little thriller i was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what i got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed o such foolishness here yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled we saw them so we could just how efficient the lisa character was and how inefficient the new hotel clerk was we see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose the flight atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead the bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight the rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too the only characters that were just liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane that was clever because i thought they would have something to do with plot from the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named lisa is in charge even when jackson shows his true colors she doesn t panic she thinks what she can do to stall time any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots but not this one it was a very short movie and i was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast thankfuly none of them were used the new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her was craven should do more of these types of movies also one last comment brian cox is in the movie but i had not one clue who he was i had to come over here to see that he is lisa s father he is completely unrecognizable 
 you ll know what i mean after you ve seen red eye overall red eye was a better than expected thriller it gets off to a slow start and slowly builds but by the time it was over it s a thumper it s hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as thrilling as i found it except that simply put the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run of the mill plot i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie that says a lot other factors i think are the closeness of victim and bad guy and that over time you begin to really relate to the victim a scant out of more like a but that s pretty good 
lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to miami she ends up sitting next to an assassin named jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies the reason she has to switch the room is because jackson wants to blow it up it s a great suspense movie because lisa tries several ways to escape this ploy that jackson has set up the whole storyline is great and i thought that they could have spent some more time on the plane there could have more to the plane but other than that the whole movie was pretty good i especially liked the ending because it was heart stopping i didn t know what was going to happen and i was surprised by it for me this movie just took off 
red eye is a thrilling film by the creator of freddy kreuger wes craven wes craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker lisa after attending the funeral of her grandmother she decides to take the red eye flight during waiting she meets this man named jack rippner how fffrreeaakkyy is that and they sort of become friends ironically both sit right next to each other on this plane then this is when the horror starts this movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who don t like thrilling horror films well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants this is an excellent example of a bone shaking production wes craven did well with this film he chose the right actors like rachel mcadams an intelligent sexy girl who knows what she s doing and is cautious of everything when she s acting in a film cillian murphy the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film and his face can really widen your eyes wes craven did an excellent job and i hope that he makes more films like this one 
like most people i ve seen jason priestley on tv and i think he s great but i didn t know he had a sister justine priestley is simply mah velous as the scorned other woman good music intrigue and a death scene involving amanda s revenge on an abusive dr that will stay with you for weeks i ll leave it at that kudos 
red eye starts in texas where hotel receptionist lisa reisert rachel mcadams is about to catch the last red eye flight back to miami where she lives works while waiting for her plane lisa meets the handsome charming jackson rippner cillian murphy they both seem to hit it off then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other once the plane takes off they are in the air jackson reveals who he really is that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary charles keefe jack scalia they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in miami jackson tells lisa to phone the hotel make it happen or her father will be killed directed by wes craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as the last house on the left a nightmare on elm street the serpent and the rainbow the people under the stairs the scream trilogy of teen slashers a short punchy fast paced little thriller like red eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film craven usually makes the script by carl ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that i must admit i really enjoyed at only odd minutes in length it s a very quick moving economical straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots some may like this approach like i did while other s may not but i think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick fast without the film slowing down any giving you a chance to relax i really liked the plot for red eye sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell it s a film made to entertain for me that s what it did i really liked the two central character s lisa comes across as very likable while jackson rippner an obvious play on the name of the notorious victorian serial killer jack the ripper is a suitably slimy villain with a cold i m only doing my job type mentality another plus point is that i didn t think anyone behaved overly stupid here everyone actually seemed like human beings the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion i really liked this it s one of craven s better more recent films craven turns in a good solid tense tight taught fast paced thriller with an attractive cast some good action a gripping plot he certainly doesn t hang about once he starts the action tension he never lets up far away the most effective part of the film is when rippner is holding lisa hostage on the plane once the film switches to miami lisa s fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it s still good a special mention goes to rachel mcadams who is absolutely gorgeous in this i could probably watch red eye again just because she is in it looks drop dead stunning those who see wes craven s name attached to red eye expecting a horror film should think again since there s no horror in it at all despite the imdb listing horror as red eye s genre i am not sure about the ending on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see lisa kill him in some way dreamworks apparently gave red eye an initial budget of but reduced it to although it s still a very well made film with glossy production values actually shot in los angeles florida in california the film was supposedly written with husband wife sean penn robin wright penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads as i have already said rachel mcadams is pure eye candy is a total babe in this worth watching the film for on her own oh she puts in a decent performance too red eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that i enjoyed immensely i didn t think i would enjoy it as much as i did i am glad i decided to watch it this definitely gets a recommendation from me rachel mcadams really is hot stuff in this 
greetings again from the darkness what a relief a thriller that actually is thrilling new it girl rachel mcadams wedding crashers and the notebook dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director wes craven scream movies and a nightmare on elm street craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane what makes this one work is the realism of the first minutes as we see mcadams interact with or people either in person or on the phone she is a natural when she meets cillian murphy the scarecrow in batman begins in what appears to be happenstance the film really takes flight watching the two yuppie types flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing is bewitching film making the plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue as with many thrillers the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero an interesting plot device leads us to believe little rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through but we can t help but cringe a bit the most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests an annoying airline passenger cillian s injury and the fx at the hotel the strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads sadly the fine screen veteran brian cox is under utilized but overall this is an above average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale 
beautifully filmed well acted tightly scripted suspense movie had me on the edge of my seat i liked the lead actress very much and thought the villain was very well done not much to chew on here in the way of a theme but if you just get in your seat turn your brain off watch the fancy camera work and enjoy the plot you will have a great time the plot is well worn and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in but that didn t bother me as i enjoyed watching it unfold in the old days they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters and there were some enticing moments when i hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines but these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused the plot got me by the throat fairly early on and never let go it s not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie as i m not sure it makes a great deal of sense just sit back and enjoy 
scream was wes craven s last decent thriller since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night including the disappointment of the scream sequels perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him so that when it came time for supper he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo finally after who knows how many bad movies later he gives us a delicious ruthless gripping chilling suspense thriller with red eye rachel mcadams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel then she meets jackson ripner cillian murphy batman beyond at the airport who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze what she doesn t know is he already knows her and he also knows her father who she will never see again if she fails to cooperate and meet jackson s demands to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination you re probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes although this is a good old fashioned thriller that s the beauty of it no special effects no cheap make up just classic suspense you feel the desperation and regret with every decision mcadams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position as always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance it s either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it cillian murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking so even if the trailer didn t reveal it his ultimate transition from charming stranger to merciless jackass isn t so surprising perhaps it would have been more trippy to see a nice guy persona like toby maguire transforming into evil relentless madman nevertheless cillian murphy after his true identity is established played the role so solidly you d really want him to die or at least get his ass kicked don t overlook this feature there are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at craven s recent pictures if not for the you do it for all the times you ll see your girlfriend or boyfriend or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you wes finally gets it right aside from his trademark mastery in suspense red eye is not without its humor as mcadams replacement cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order it was a relief that red eye wasn t a disappointment instead you ll get the pleasure of seeing mcadams deliver another incredibly talented performance murphy look creepier by the minute and craven craft a classic traditional thriller a flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of craven s renaissance had it arrived right after scream 
i find i enjoy this show but the format needs some work first off the good attributes i like how this show will take us through the day to day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad they ve allowed their lives to become this is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome intervention doesn t candy coat things and sometimes the outcome often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing is a negative outcome this makes the positive outcomes all the better another thing i like about the show is the quality of the camera work given the reality that these cameramen have to squeeze anywhere and don t have the benefit of re shooting scenes the photography is surprisingly good and stable it s actually superior to scripted shows like the shield where the photography is so bad it can induce nausea now for the bad an episode will sometimes contain two completely different and unrelated cases that will be mixed together during the show you ll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly you re thrown into the story of another get caught up in that story then suddenly you re back to the first addict or are you by now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to this constant flip flopping between addicts really gets disruptive during the intervention scenes because the show will even mix together the two completely unrelated interventions i once heard the marketing b s reason for this poor design the show can get so intense that switching to another addict allows the viewer time to absorb what they re watching oh please clearly the reason this is done is because they have two cases that aren t big enough for an hour show so they mix two together by mixing them instead of giving each a half hour block like they should it forces the viewer to watch the entire thing and the commercials if they are interested in one case but not the other i used to find these blender episodes so annoying that i d only tell my tivo to record episodes containing one addict but then it became easier just to record all of them 
i was on france around march and i love to go to this film festivals i knew about this cin mas d am rique latine de toulouse but i ve never went to it i decided to go and then i caught cero y van the film is stunning it doesn t caused the impact on me like with the mexican users because it was french subtitled but it s still shocking this film is a satire about urban violence about kidnapping and crime on the streets in mexico it is a crude portrait of the city of a metropolis secuestro express with a stunning mia maestro which was also a satire of kidnapping almost but with a more serious tone has and i think so some kinda connection with cero y van a sort of redemption story and that how much is too much man on fire that was stunningly strong was also not a satire but a crude portrait into the streets of mexico or it is like the brave one a film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard this is like the usual suspects it has some plot twists and turns but that makes it even more believable verdict a film that shocks and makes you believe that there s no security on the streets anymore stunning dialogue impressive direction and astonishing performances cero y van is a film that you won t forget soon leaves you shaking and stunned 
this movie even though is about one of the most favorite topics of mexican producers producers the extreme life in our cities has a funny way to put it on the screen four of the more important mexican directors of the last times approach histories of our city framed in diverse literary sorts as it can be the farce or the satire which gives us a film with a over exposed topic in our country but narrated in a very different way which gives a freshness tone him with actors little known but that interprets of excellent way their paper each one of the directors reflect in the stories the capacity by we have been identified anywhere in the world that capacity of laugh the pains and to make celebration of the sadness perhaps to many people in our country the film not have pleased but i consider that people of other countries could find attractive and share the surrealism of the mexican 
a most awaited film of the year after three and half years of hibernation rajini has acted in this movie the hype for this film was toooooo high this is not a typical rajini film in this film he gives some spiritual messages also but it also includes typical rajini actions style songs etc its a good entertaining movie and gives good messages also i will rate this movie as good instead of excellent because of the screenplay its a must watch movie dont miss it 
when friendship kills in my opinion is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic anytime lexi katie wright or jennifer marley shelton threw up i wanted to vomit myself it s kind of hard to explain why if you ask me they should have been more cooperative about things however i did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents before i wrap this up i d like to say if you ask me when friendship kills does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person s body now in conclusion i recommend this movie to everyone who hasn t seen it you re in for some tears and a good time so the next time it s on tv kick back with a friend and watch it 
i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one it deals with issues that most directors shy away from my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldn t buy a copy for my friend it s a touching story about how people with eating disorders don t necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of 
i agree with the above comment i love the realism in this and in many movies not just movies on eating disorders the producers seem to forget that they take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again which i dislike because its not reality not meaning to say things can t get better and not meaning to say things don t in this movie but it doesn t spend most of the movie creating all these problems and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again when people have eating disorders people don t just admit it and want to get better and then life is peachy it takes time and i like how in this movie we grow with the characters we go through the difficulties with them getting better and worse because it is a very important part of the movie it gets into the minds of people with eating disorders and shows the complications and pain in a very realistic way and i loved that i also love how it shows the secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders it is scary to see how people react when they find out especially if they approve of it i thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told and defiantly one of my favourites 
there are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them this film shows it as it is it is not glamourised for the viewers to enjoy it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful i ve only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel it is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop this is what films should be about they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong 
i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character lexi doesn t automatically just get better she gets better and then has a drawback i think this movie shows more than the others that i ve seen that getting better doesn t just happen it s hard work and takes time it s a long path to recovery i think this movie shows all of that very well there should be more movies like this 
a beautiful piece of children s cinema buried in a world of archaic celticism setting the story around the famous book of kels believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of iona off the western coast of scotland telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of crom cruic the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology in hopes of recovering a lost artefact the films true beauty lies in its animation cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant cartoon network series samurai jack for its genius use of mark making and background depth the secret of kels creates a consistently affective celtic world living under the shadow of viking invasion the history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and celtic revivalist mysticism the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is as she glides from branch to branch appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary cheshire cat from alice and wonderland the secret of kels is an absolute treat for all genders all ages it s a lovely piece of family cinema don t expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed 
the secret of kells is one of the most unique beautiful and eye popping animated films i have ever seen before watching this film i was convinced that nothing could give up a run for its money and that it was a shoo in to win in this category but i found in kells a serious contender the secret of kells tell the story of a young orphan named brendan who lives with his uncle the abbot of kell the abbot is a loving guardian but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by vikings than he is at nurturing the boy s imagination when the legendary brother aidan who looks surprisingly like willie nelson shows up and takes the boy under his wing brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named aisling who takes a liking to him and saves his life more than once with aisling s help he attempts to save the town and help brother aidan complete the mystical book which legend has it can turn dark into light see my full review of the secret of kells at http theoscarsblog blogspot com movie review secret of kells html
the secret of kells is an independent animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the book of kells an illuminated manuscript from the middle ages featuring the four gospels of the new testament i didn t know that this book actually exists but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier there are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be who wrote it and how it has survived over years this is one of them we are introduced to brendan an orphan who lives at the abbey of kells in ireland with his uncle abbot cellach voiced by brendan gleeson abbot cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks they are more focused on reading and writing something abbot cellach does not have time for anymore he fears the northmen those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the ground one day a traveler comes from the island of iona near scotland it is brother aidan a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished abbot cellach grants him permission to stay and brendan buddies up with him aidan has special plans for brendan first he needs ink for the book but he requires specific berries the only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest an area off limits to brendan seeing that he is the only chance for aidan to continue his work he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence in the forest brendan meets ashley the protector of the forest she allows brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company she warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it there are things worse than vikings out there from there brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasion i like the story a lot more now that i know what it is about knowing now what the book of kells is and what it contains the animation makes perfect sense i m sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago with frilly borders colorful pictures and extravagant patterns creatures and writings adorning the pages much like the opening frames of disney s the sword in the stone the animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns it creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each other i couldn t take my eyes off of the incredible detail this is some of the finest d animation i have seen in years it s vibrant stimulating and full of life the characters are constantly surrounded by designs doodles and patterns in trees on the walls and in the air just floating around it enhances the film the story is satisfactory although i think the ending could have been strung out a little more with a runtime of only minutes i think there could have been something special in the final act it doesn t give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book we are reminded of it s importance but never fully understand we are told that it gives hope but never why or how that was really the only lacking portion of the film otherwise i thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation i guess that s okay to a certain degree the animation can carry a film so far before it falls short the story lacks a few parts but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history i would recommend looking up briefly the book of kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about i think it will help your viewing experience a lot more this a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed 
the secret of kells is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart the shortcomings of the film s limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young brendan s heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages historically this was in the late th century when the centers of irish learning were over run by the vikings the vikings appear here as brute antagonists the equivalent on the north seas of the plundering huns and mongols further east the film s narrative which functions more as a parable centers around the conflict between brendan who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness and his stern uncle the abbot who seeks to protect the town of kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the norsemen the abbot disregards the value of brendan s art in his quest for security this is the movie s outer conflict brendan s inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the book of kells this eye is guarded by a dragon ouroboros who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the vikings will kill from without that s as much of the story as i ll divulge what i really like about this film is its creators imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the west from years ago the characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original book of kells particularly noteworthy is monk aidan s pet cat defined in few lines yet purely and even magically metamorphically feline the range of emotion which brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators the decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in the secret of kells of course historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict however by introducing archetypal elements into this story the writers and director of the secret of kells convey a numinous sense of lived life from that far off time in ireland which feels psychologically true however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact the united nations band of illuminators who appear as a rogues club of artists in the secret of kells aren t historically probable but they re all well designed individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially irish story animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures the magnificent art direction of this movie clearly derives from its historical visual source but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling if animation had existed in the dark ages the secret of kells is what it would look like finally brendan s hero s quest in this film is the artist s perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty life and inspiration without being preachy or even particularly christian this movie affirms jesus dictum that man does not live by bread alone in my estimation the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is andrei tarkovsky s andrei rublev a film about the great russian icon painter of the th century the secret of kells expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artist s visual quest and creative process it s certainly not as profound as andrei rublev but heck its a cartoon and one which will appeal to young and old alike i think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing in its own modest life affirming way this stylized secret of kells is a classic 
i would not have known about this film if not for its surprise oscar nomination for best animated feature film thankfully it came to pass that i was able to watch this animated little treasure the story is about the child brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of the township of kells the main pre occupation of the abbot is to build a wall to protect kells from the attacking vikings one day aiden the renowned illustrator from iona sought refuge with them aiden opens brendan s eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world along the way brendan befriended the white forest sprite aisling as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration the secret of kells is unlike most of the animation released these days it is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism as much as symbolism the movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of kung fu panda however it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience the reds used in the viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting try to catch this quiet gem of a film it is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as monsters vs aliens and the like the sparse celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film ok the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting i would have liked to know more about the book that brendan and aiden was working on but the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork said to be based on the artwork in the real book of kells 
a featherweight plot and dubious characterizations don t make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is lively action and spectacular stunts for their day give this movie some real zip and there s some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads quinn makes a good villain also although his role is completely overshadowed but don t be fooled by maureen o hara s tough broad role this is as sexist as any hollywood movie of this era you might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made but it s still hard to get past for all the heroism and gruesomely adult off screen situations this is still little more than an adolescent good time 
 against all flags is every bit the classic swashbuckler it has all the elements the adventure fan could hope for and more for in this one the damsel in distress is well not really in distress as spitfire stevens maureen o hara is at her athletic best running her foes through in defiance of the social norms of the period anthony quinn rounds out the top three billed actors as the ruthless captain roc brasiliano and proves to be a wily and capable nemesis for brian hawke flynn for the classic adventure fan against all flags is a must see while it may not be in quite the same league as some of errol flynn s earlier work captain blood and the sea hawk for instance it is still a greatly entertaining romp 
excellent pirate entertainment it has all the good ingredients to keep one s attention an absorbing tale of intrigue a fiery lady pirate named spitfire stevens maureen o hara who s attracted to the irresistible mr hawke errol flynn who is out on a secret mission of his own they make a fine romantic pair onscreen sigh anthony quinn is the mean bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer i noticed the very familiar face of mildred natwick playing a supporting role as mrs macgregor the protector of young princess patma alice kelley there is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines ships and the bay lots of action too of sword fighting clashes ship battles daring leaps of errol flynn robin hood on board ship from the flaming redhead herself i once heard in an interview of maureen o hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo flynn in sword fighting in those days but there d be no need to put it to the test here very enjoyable movie 
having seen charley boorman in long way round with ewan mcgregor i was very interested to see how charley would be in his own show i thought charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness it just show s their human too i don t know a lot about bikes but this show gripped me right from the start the preparation and organising for this event seems immense the event itself seems very dangerous and i m fascinated to see why charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets i love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music i can t believe he broke his collar bone i really hope its not the end i cant wait to see the next episode 
clara bow hula calhoun is daughter of plantation owner albert gran bill calhoun who is mainly interested in playing cards and boozing with friends she s interested in riding in the countryside until engineer clive brook anthony haldane shows up to build a dam one of her father s friends arlette marchal mrs bane then competes for his attentions his wife maude truax margaret haldane shows up for the contrived finale lots of pre code elements like nude bathing wonderful location shooting in hawaii 
alain delon visits swift sure vengeance on the ruthless crime family that employed him as a hit man in the duccio tessari thriller big guns after they accidentally murder his wife and child tessari and scenarists roberto gandus ugo liberatore of a minute to pray a second to die and franco verucci of ring of death take this actioneer about a career gunman for the mob right down to the wire indeed big guns is rather predictable but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of savage and often sudden killings alain delon of the godson is appropriately laconic as he methodically deals out death to the heads of the mob families who refused to let him retire so that he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter richard conte of the godfather plays a sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the hatchet with the delon character but the rest of his hard nosed associates want the hit man dead like most crime thrillers in the s and s big guns subscribes to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay interestingly the one man who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice tessari does not waste a second in this minute shoot em up apart from the mother and son dying in a car bomb meant for the father the worst thing that takes place occurs in an automobile salvage yard when an associate of the hero is crushed in a junked car ostensibly big guns is a rather bloodless outing but it does have a high body count for a mobster melodrama only at the last minute does our protagonist let his guard down and so the contrived morality of an eye for an eye remains intact tessari stages a couple of decent car chases and the death of a don in a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn gets the photography and the compositions are excellent 
many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the story line was rather typical of clara s later silents i still find it somewhat heart stirring and incredibly fun clara plays a happy go lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves never mind that this man is married clara s lack of modesty was shocking in the day but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not a brilliant story line quite typical actually this movie is a nice showcase of clara s ability to make the audience laugh 
there s a theory of time that posits that all the moments that ever existed and will exist actually exist right now it s a bit too much to wrap your head around but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place for barbara jean trenton ida lupino that time was twenty five years earlier the mid s when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise for my part if i could travel through time it would be back to the s when i grew up maybe to a place like willoughby but that s another episode one thing that wouldn t be so special about would involve dealing with all that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of the twilight zone how many reels do you think it would take to catalog the entire series and then find a particular story you wanted to watch i guess you have to consider the trade offs convenience versus simplicity having it right now or taking the time to spool it up to the exact spot where the story begins popping in a cd has it s advantages i m a little surprised that rod serling would pen a story that so closely resembled sunset boulevard ida lupino s character mirror imaged norma desmond just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept martin balsam portrays very much a similar character to erich von stroheim the husband turned butler who s loyalty is unquestioned where the story diverges has to do with the way danny balsam and sall ted de corsia challenge barbara jean to get with reality and clear the cobwebs that paralyze her existence fortunately for us viewers ida lupino had no such reservations about taking parts that were not big but a nice showcase it s a real treat to watch any episode of the twilight zone and get to see who pops up from days gone by sometimes you get a two fer like you have here with lupino and balsam celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began and sometimes after combined with the stories that the program produced it s not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today 
i found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian chris rock who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid s white mans body he doesn t realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before he listens to rap music sings along and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man the real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community 
this was a hilarious movie and i would see it again and again it isn t a movie for someone who doesn t have a fun sense of a humor but for people who enoy comedy like chris rock its a perfect movie in my opinion it is really funnny
hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of s this movie s true score as mentioned before chris rock is the king previous to going to see this movie i wasn t that over the top about him but now i m banging on the doors of chris rock s website begging him to take me on as his protege this film is truly funny if you don t find this movie funny you really need therapy and it s humour which targets all areas of society including race predictably class division love wealth employment dreams stand up comedy the list goes on there was one slight disappointment for me however this was that in going into this film i didn t realise that it was actually a remake of heaven can wait another quite good movie made in with warren beatty as such i was quite surprised when i watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie i had watched on tv a few weeks ago regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any you get the picture well to the actual plot of the film don t spoil the experience for yourself don t read the plot just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have raved mad about it go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time go and see it because it s a cinema experience that doesn t leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets go see it because it is a good movie 
great movie when i saw it have to say one of my favorite movies of all time i saw it like times in the theater and got the dvd as i got older and saw it again i realized that the movie is average compared to movies that are known ad good comedys this is nothing i mean rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking it s like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch i like the movie overall so i give it a still a good for me 
i m not saying that just as a chris rock fan i m saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong the first flaw was it s everything works out ending that everybody saw coming flaw number two was i found that the chemistry between regina king and chris rock seemed fake finally the acting in this movie was sub par with the best actor being regina king and the worst being mark addy but i saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy in a heads up scenario watch heaven can wait instead it s better so for all you chris rock fans out there watch this movie you ll enjoy out he has some good stand up in this movie overall out of 
chris rock stars in this remake of warren beatty s heaven can wait itself a remake of the film here comes mr jordan a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and his adventures in his new albeit temporary body in the beatty version the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the then los angeles rams in rock s hipper version our lead character is a struggling young and decidedly low talent standup comedian it s very funny to see the razor sharp rock playing a bad comedian it s kind of like seeing tom hanks play a bad actor lance barton s dream is to play the legendary apollo theater on a non amateur night but every time he tries out his material he s booed off the stage lustily so much so that his nickname becomes booie his jokes are lame his delivery painful in short lance is everything that the real chris rock isn t lance is also a bike messenger and he s riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when bam he s hit by a truck ok so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel eugene levy but hey he was going to get hit anyway no dice it appears lance isn t due in heaven until so what to do mr king chazz palminteri the manager of heaven reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not quite dead mr barton trouble is the body they find is of a greedy old white man turns out this fella a mr wellington owns all kinds of things he s the th richest man in the country what luck you can imagine how lance will turn things around but of course while in the body of the affluent mr wellington lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker regina king we males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body but try winning one over while you re an dumpy old white guy and it s even worse when she s not impressed by your money this is rock s first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he performs admirably there s still a lot of the standup comedian in him and of course if he ever wants to get diverse roles he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script but this isn t really a bad thing rock s personality his drive his delivery his demeanor and his passion are what fuel this film he s clearly having a lot of fun in the role and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him 
this is such a great film never mind the low rating here i really have no idea where that came from they must be discussing a different film then because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure it s story was so original and charming i really can t think of anything bad to say about it maybe it has to be your type of thing but i saw this with my sister and my mother and we all were taken by it the acting was also very good and that is hard to do in a film like this but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic i ve always been very fond of dougray scott and found his new dark role very interesting it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy but i absolutely had no problem with that this time even more so i adored him everyone who loves a good thriller drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film no question about that anyone wanting to see a film with bloodshed should go rent something else though but i guess the title already kind of gives that away this is a love story not saw i give this film out of five stars good job xxx enjoy 
i have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it s awesome but the only thing with it was that in the beginning there was too much talk of who s going out with who i think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it but on the official site they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it what s even happened to patty dunning now she is a pretty good actress she has done several other movies in the s and s but we haven t heard from her since i know for sure about thom rachford who plays jerry works for accounting at rd films but overall i have to say that the series itself is like left behind gone old school 
stylish moody innovative revenge driven bloodbath also cheesy of course and sporadically very cheesy it reminded me a lot of the big heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event and the girl comes around to the good guy s side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy it s sad there s no gloria grahame but so fantastic that it s alain delon and not glenn ford could there be anyone as beautiful as alain going around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat yet he s totally tough and icy cool no one nowadays can touch him though someone like jude law could try i guess hard for any girl to look good with him the music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chases and those aren t generally my cup of tea especially one willy nilly one in the woods people also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion for instance in a junkyard cruncher but beyond the cheese the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off more creativity excitement and freshness in that forgotten movie than most of what i ve seen lately 
i ve read most of the comments on this movie i have seen this movie and the whole prophecy series many times with family members of all ages we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times no one got scared or traumatized like i have read on some posts the movie is just based on biblical facts i have seen a lot of end time movies tribulation armagedon and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths it may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but i believe it is a good witnessing tool this movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website higherpraise com and judge for yourself blessings to all 
a thief in the night has got to be the best out of all the end times thrillers i have no clue what people are complaining about what people are whining about when they say that these movies scared them into accepting god they just needed to find an excuse and blamed a thief in the night do not listen these movies do not only tell of one of the many possibilities of the tribulation but they re also fun to watch in their simplicity they are in fact low budget and that is a little obvious but not all too obvious upon first viewing i had no clue because i really assumed that a lot of movies like these made in the s included low budgets all the time a thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical patty myers who lives for what comes her way until her husband and nearly all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture everyone warned her about at first the movie isn t all based around her until the rapture happens what it leads up to are showing that everyone else around her are becoming christians and believing in christ which is usually what happens to a lot of people everyone around them they once knew and loved will be gone forever and the one who is left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves no one can ever blame themselves because they re always right just like these whiners who complain about the movie these people must be full grown adults i m thirteen and you don t see me whining especially since i was exactly like patty before i re accepted christ into my heart for those who haven t seen it if you want a little bit of everything tossed into a christian movie instead of stereo typical everyone else is wrong movies than you ll enjoy a thief in the night don t knock it before you try it something new is always good trust your own instincts 
obviously there wasn t a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other great chinese films i first saw this when i was years old i ran home and begged god to forgive me for everything 
to all the reviewers on this page i would have to say this movie is worth seeing so it was made in so what the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time people who didn t study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball compared to the modern series `left behind which is made for our time right now it does look cheezy however the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion which again was over years in the past but the message that is sent in this film is very powerful and carefully preserved there is just so much to say but i refuse to say it for fear of spoiling it so go out and see this film if you don t like the message that it sends then you have issues that need some attention 
i remember seeing this movie a long time ago back then even though it didn t have any special effects the acting was really good and it still has the same message for today even though the technology has changed maybe they should make a remake of this movie it would be interesting to see a remake i also enjoyed the music from the movie as well larry norman was a really good songwriter during that time period although now most christian music is now worship and praise music i was always curious to know what ever happened to patty after the series ended did she go on to make more movies did she get eventually get married and raise a family i would like to have an update 
the reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did that means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it when i first saw this movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion this is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written of course non believers will say its only a sci fi movie truth is this movie is a must have for your thriller collection even if it does have a religious view if you are a fan of classic thrillers omen etc this is one of them and its a must have i never saw the sequel distant thunder but i believe it picks up where this movie ends 
night of the living homeless is a funny spoof of the film and the remake of dawn of the dead only this time with the homeless the episode has homeless people all coming to south park and the people cannot figure out why they treat the homeless like zombies who want change and a few of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie so now it s up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them this is a fairly funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the pac dr dre song california love overall a good episode 
long before tim lahaye and jerry b jenkins would shake the world of the christian subculture and make millions in the process with the left behind books mark iv pictures the christian film distribution company of the billy graham evangelistic association gave us this masterwork what i love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail sitting in a living room instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this post rapture tribulation we sit in the living room hearing about it on the news because the filmmakers can t afford to show it the film s premise is grounded in pre millenial pre tribulation eschatalogy believing that christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth what used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh the intriguing adventures of patty and her journey throughout the tribulation and two of the film s three sequels tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation i hate to admit it but i still thoroughly enjoy watching this it even has the same exact score of monty python and the holy grail i think i m the only person in history to make that observation 
ms patty duke s story about her life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles i saw myself acting out just like her i was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as children i saw the movie when it first premiered in and i have loved this movie so much anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for that is not the issue here the issue is how ms duke had an illness and fought to survive it and overcame ms duke has much to be proud of in her accomplishments with her struggles for survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hope unless a person has struggled with this illness personally they don t know the hell they have to live with the movie to me was a success because it showed the real issues and how a person who is depressed and manic acts it was so real so so real it was like watching myself up there on screen i wish i could thank ms patty duke in person for having the courage to let the public know about her illness bocka
this is such a great movie call me anna because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her for patty duke to come out in the publics eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease i have a lot of respect for her as a person the only thing i don t like is i can t get it on tape i ve tried looking for it but with no success any one know how to get it 
elvira cassandra peterson is the host of a cheap horror show after she finds out that her dead aunt has left her some stuff elvira goes to england to pick it up hoping it will be some money but to her horror elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house her dog and a cookbook elvira decides to settle in the house anyways but with her striking dark looks and her stunning features she will not be able to live in peace all the neighbours are now turning the whole town against her and with elvira s outrageous attitude and looks everyone better watch out because elvira is on fire i really enjoyed this movie it s really fun to watch get elvira into all these adventures she s just great the whole movie puts you into a halloween mood sure it s silly and the jokes are cheap but it s a pleasure to watch it i would give elvira mistress of the dark 
i suck at gratuitous boob references so i m just going to write a plainly flat no pun intended review i love elvira not in a i m going to shoot the pres just to impress jodi foster fanatical way but suffice to say i think she rocks the movie is played like a s horror film only alot more fun look for the leasurely stroking of the ankle reference to know what i mean what relay shines through in the movie is elvira s or should that be cassandras absolute charm i first saw this movie at the tender age of and have seen it contless times since i realy should get around to buying a copy the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear if any other fans of the movie want to e mail me about it feel free p s another great performance from edie mcclurg chastedy pariah an actress who never gets the attention she deserves 
when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go but its not all that easy in this movie you will come across hilarious humor a witch a book of spells recopies a mentally challenged uncle and a dog you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie hope you like it in total i will have to give it a no i m totally joking ill give it a hope you understand that you will laugh you will scream and you may just be offended love yours truly dakota you can email me at dakota_loves_it hot mail com if you wanna
there are two things that i like about elvira and they re both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up her wit and her talent a movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she commands attention looking like a combined clone of morticia adams and anna nicole smith she inherits a distant relative s estate only to discover that she is really the heiress of the occult the comedy in this movie is the best thing about it but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling it s mostly a campy fare with as many bad horror movie references in it such as the rioting mob or the fleeing heroine who trips and stumbles on her heels my favorite part is when she uses her marvelous endowments to break the chains keeping her locked in the cemetary the ending is sappingly sweet as if it were written by the bradys but the las vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this type of movie 
elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies it has every thing you would want in a film like great one liners sexy star and a outrageous story if you have not seen it you are missing out on one of the greatest films made i can t wait till her new movie comes out 
this film is pure elvira and shows her at her breast i mean best the story co written by cassandra peterson elvira s alter ego is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by elvira s wit and charm the viewer gets an opportunity to see elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of fallwell massachusetts where she has travelled from los angeles in order to attend the reading of her great aunt morganna s will and at the same time tries to help the long suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal chastity pariah and the rest of the town council she also has to deal with her attraction to bob redding the owner of the local cinema and another woman patty who has her eye on bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as elvira and later in the movie she also faces the complications of being descended from a major metaphysical celebrity and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable streetwise and naive in this film while cracking risque jokes and delivering off beat lines with double meanings this movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams in the end elvira s dreams finally come true which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman i ve seen this movie countless times and i never ever get tired of it there are no unnecessary scenes and i found myself captivated throughout the whole movie a review will not do justice to the actual movie so i can just tell you to please watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made meanwhile i wish you unpleasant dreams 
those who are not familiar with cassandra peterson s alter ego elvira then this is a good place to start elvira mistress of the dark starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money unfortunately the place she has to go is the town of fallwell massachusetts having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down she finds out that her great aunt left her things a house a dog and a cookbook the town residents have mixed reactions the teens like her the women hate her and the men lust after her although trying to remain moral pillars of the community her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent w morgan sheppard because he wants her cookbook seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock the film is actually pretty funny with peterson a k a elvira using her endowments and sexiness as a joke and don t forget tomorrow we re showing the head with two things i mean the thing with two heads especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line but ends up looking ridiculous the picnic scene is the perfect example deserves a peek the film not her boobs of course 
elvira mistress of the dark directed by james signorelli starring cassandra peterson w morgan sheppard daniel greene and edie mcclurg plot elvira cassandra peterson quits her tv show and heads to the small christian town fallwell massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt s inheritance hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in vegas unfortunately for her all she gets is a creepy old house a poodle and a magic cookbook while in fallwell elvira tries to make money breathe some life into the teenagers win the heart of a stud daniel greene avoid being burned at the stake and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle w morgan sheppard who is planning to use the book to end the world my thoughts i love both cassandra peterson and her alter ego elvira she is a very successful beautiful and funny woman and as elvira she s all that plus morbid and hilariously naive not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers in this movie her charms are put to good use i loved the whole fish out of water feel to the film you got elvira with her low cut black dress her big black hair and her enormous twins and she s in a christian town where most of the girls aren t even allowed to wear makeup this also makes her love story with bob daniel greene a lot more entertaining w morgan sheppard is equally great as elvira s uncle nemesis vincent out to steal the book to use it for evil he has a lot of presence but still doesn t get in the way and steal scenes from elvira what really makes the film is not the plot but the many jokes everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a scary movie sequel i hear there are about boob jokes in this film and any fan of roger corman b horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film if you love elvira you will love this flick also check out elvira s haunted hills 
 elvira mistress of the dark is a sort of harper valley p t a with touches of the supernatural elvira cassandra peterson walks off her job as television horror movie hostess after the new station s owner gets fresh with her she s now relying on a las vegas show to carry her through but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her aunt s death which then takes elvira to massachusetts for the reading of the will a house in need of repairs a dog and a cookbook are all that is left to her by her aunt and again it seems elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the las vegas show the adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for elvira only the local hunk daniel greene and a group of teenagers will befriend her elvira s uncle vinnie w morgan sheppard presses to make a deal with elvira for the cookbook but elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting and a couple very effective casseroles elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town s old charge of witchcraft and the showdown between her and her uncle the plot is pretty simple but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace elvira mistress of the dark is full of cute gross bawdy and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags puns props songs and parodies the film s touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made it is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers including edie mcclurg and jeff conaway of grease there are also nice special effects many people including myself wondered if the elvira character could carry a feature film and the answer is delightfully yes 
i don t doubt that the critics panned this movie especially the artsy fartsys who need a laxative this is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of abbot costello or more recently don knotts it won t shake the world or change movies forever what it will do is entertain when all is said done that s the most important thing anyway watch this movie forget your troubles it even has a simple kind moral message at no extra charge i always loved elvira s tv show when i lived in la she did not really steal her schtick from vampira any more than vampira did from the original theda bara this sort of mythic character belongs to whoever does it best cassandra peterson does it best long live elvira we need more of these kind of movies there are never enough the villain william morgan sheppard was also excellent he exudes a wonderful refined malice i could find no technical faults the execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets my profound compliments to the director james signorelli all his crew 
this tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being the irreverent pupils the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils the adult characters all seem familiar my teachers my bus driver each one of their opinions so plausible and well known when a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints all the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip mr harvey is experiencing much pain throughout he reminds me of war damaged teachers i did not understand when i was an irreverent pupil rhidian brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped british film the acting unblemished the scenes appropriate it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity 
 why did they make them so big why didn t they just give the money to the poor the question about cathedrals was asked by a student to mr harvey during a school field trip to salisbury cathedral that s a good question he replied partly to inspire them to get them to look up with awe i m not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone but this movie certainly had that impact on me it was awesome it didn t start out that way for a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of well a school field trip to salisbury cathedral if you ve ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it you have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day the bus driver who s driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control been there done that got the t shirt was my initial reaction i figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students yawn but it turns out to be so much more timothy spall was brilliant as mr harvey a sombre unsmiling teacher with a strange fascination for cathedrals over the course of the movie his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story we also get introduced to some of the troubled students most notably helen also brilliantly played by nathalie press who s into self mutilation this isn t a religious movie but it includes some powerful reflections on religious themes when harvey s colleague jonathon played by ben miles says i don t care what anyone believes as long as they don t try to force it on anyone else harvey replies that isn t tolerance it s indifference which is in fact in my opinion what often passes for religious tolerance in our society there are scenes of reconciliation between various characters and the final scene of the movie was brilliant as harvey climbs back on the bus director susanna white has the camera slowly pan upwards so that the final shot is simply of the sky hearkening back to harvey s comment that the purpose of the cathedral is to get people to look up in awe the cathedral accomplishes its goal we look up into the universe in awe seeking something greater than ourselves however we choose to define it this is a very powerful and very inspiring movie 
 mr harvey lights a candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by timothy spall while we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising spall s range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the mike leigh repertory while an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on the simpsons this central situation of a visit to salisbury cathedral in rhidian brook s script is well contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into acts we re introduced to the urban british range of racially and religiously diverse kids with their uniforms i couldn t tell if this is a private or public school as they gather the rapping black kids the serious south asians and muslims the white bullies and mean girls but conveyed quite naturally and individually the young actors some of whom i recognized from british tv such as shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures celia imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor s role than the martinets she usually has to play a break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious we think like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but it s much more about faith in people as well as god which is why the bbc showed it in england at easter time and bbc america showed it in the u s over christmas nathalie press who was also so good in summer of love has a key role in mr harvey s redemption that could have been played for movie of the week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way unfortunately i saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials while it is a bit heavy handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than i ve seen in most holiday themed tv movies 
if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it it s quite shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important issues but it s not didactic in my opinion it s a piece of art beautifully filmed fine music of many styles the typically impressive level of acting that one has come to expect from bbc drama nathalie press billed as natalie press is convincing in her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate celia imrie has that beautifully reassuring quality that gives the sometimes unnerving action stability and the viewer comfort in the knowledge that someone out there is actually normal but the real star as always is timothy spall surely one of the greatest actors of our time 
amazing acting music a simple and clear plot but it drew me in and kept me captivated all the way through i don t know why it was so fantastic but it simply was so many of the characters were so real it moved me and made me think i would like to watch more like this the idea of a school trip as a forum for such an amazing plot was a genius idea and so many of the people were like people were like those encountered every day by teachers in the classroom the film tackles issues of religion prejudice drugs friendship memories difficult experiences and simple the diversity of life itself 
a fine effort for an australian show which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a resurgence in quality aussie drama dare i compare this show to the brilliance of love my way no but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us the cast is great gibney works her magic in the first two episodes i have seen the british cast is strong also especially the callum and lizzie characters but abe forsythe may be the saving light not that it needs saving if this show is to get another season i wasn t a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome marking time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always greener its also good to see brooke satchwell again lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode 
finally we get a tv series where we get to see the acting talent episode one was excellent the script gave us a little more than usual yeah there was still the i m not your father i m your father and omigod you cheated on me rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if like so many tv soaps do the camera work also gave us a little more than usual there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary shots inside shots or hand held camera crap to add an artistic edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well nothing was over dramatised or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant it was such a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script a real opportunity thank you tony tilse sam miller channel ten and all cast and crew wonderful work please continue what you are doing your efforts are much appreciated and do not go unnoticed

championship hanging in the balance taker and the rock got face to face with kurt angle begging for some attention off to the side he got attention in the form of a beat down form the two other men soon after taker spilled out of the ring and the rock brawled with angle angle gave a series of suplexes that took down rock but the great one countered with a ddt that managed a two count the fight continued outside the ring with taker coming to life and clotheslining angle and repeatedly smacking the rock taker and rock got into it back into the ring and taker dropped the rock with a sidewalk slam to get a two count rock rebounded grabbed taker by the throat and chokeslammed him angle broke up the pin attempt that likely would have given the rock the title the rock retaliated by latching on the ankle lock to kurt angle angle reversed the move and rock bottomed the people s champion soon after the rock disposed of angle and hit the people s elbow on the undertaker angle tried to take advantage by disabling the great one outside the ring and covering taker who kicked out after a two count outside the ring rock took a big swig from a nearby water bottle and spewed the liquid into taker s face to blind the champion taker didn t stay disabled for long and managed to overpower rock and turn his attention to angle taker landed a guillotine leg drop onto angle laying on the ring apron the rock picked himself up just in time to break up a pin attempt on kurt angle taker nailed rock with a ddt and set him up for a chokeslam angle tried sneaking up with a steel chair but taker caught on to that tomfoolery and smacked it out of his hands the referee got caught in the ensuing fire and didn t see angle knock taker silly with a steel chair angle went to cover taker as the rock lay prone but the dead man somehow got his shoulder up angle tried to pin rock but he too kicked out the rock got up and landed angle in the sharpshooter angle looked like he was about to tap but taker kicked the rock out of the submission hold taker picked rock up and crashed him with the last ride while the dead man covered him for the win angle raced in and picked taker up in the ankle lock taker went delirious with pain but managed to counter he picked angle up for the last ride but angle put on a triangle choke it looked like taker was about to pass out but the rock broke angle s hold only to find himself caught in the ankle lock rock got out of the hold and watched taker chokeslam angle rocky hit the rock bottom but taker refused to go down and kicked out angle whirled taker up into the angle slam but was rock bottomed by the great one and pinned winner and new wwe champion the rock finally there is a decent ppv lately the ppv weren t very good but this one was a winner i

have you ever in your life gone out for a sport s activity tried your best and then found yourself in an important segment of it where for a brief moment you were given a chance to be a hero and a champion and failed i believe many of us have had that moment in our lives this is the premise of the movie the best of times in this story a middle age banker named jack dundee robin williams suffers from the deep melancholy of a football mistake which happened years ago is inspired to re play the game again in order to accomplish this he must convince the once great football quarterback reno hightower kurt russell to make a comeback for reno who is satisfied with his present lot in life see s no need to change the past record which get s better as he ages added to both their problem is the fact years have passed and in addition both their marriages are floundering and in need of re vamping not easy when his father in law donald moffat habitually reminds him of the biggest drop nevertheless dundee is persistent and will do anything to try and correct the greatest blunder of his life great fun for anyone wishing to enjoy their youth again 
this movie has everything you want from an action movie explosions shootouts bad guys and worse guys it is fun to see james belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself in to since he stole million dollars from the ultimate big boss the skipper does this sounds cheesy of course it is but boy did i have fun watching this movie it is a whole lot better than all the direct to dvd garbage that is made nowadays if you can get over the silly plot than you will find out that this movie has quite a few surprises in store you could argue about the twists being predictable but the fast pace of this movie doesn t give you time too think too much of them which is a blessing since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist but more about the journey to that moment only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie they probably expected a movie about mobsters in stead of some crooks double crossing each other pure fun 
i bought this movie a few days ago and thought that it would be a pretty shitty film but when i popped it into the dvd player it surprised me in a very good way james belushi plays very well as bill the mouth manuccie but especially timothy dalton plays a very good roll as the sheriff the end scene in the house of bill is very excellent good camera work nice dialogues and very good acting bill the mouth manuccie has stolen million dollars from the mafia together with his wife he lives in south carolina in a witness protection program but the mafia tracks him down and wants the million dollar bill can only trust the only person he knows inside out himself 
great entertainment from start to the end wonderful performances by belushi beach dalton railsback some twists and many action scenes the movie was made for me funny lines in the screenplay good music dalton as the tough sheriff and railsback as redneck villain i must recommend this film to every action adventure fan 
a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store after he s done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he ll be transferring soon bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals animals like say a certain rabbit this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early s it still remains as funny nearly years later this animated short can be seen on disc of the looney tunes golden collection volume my grade a 
this along with hare tonic ranks as one of the best bugs cartoons indeed one of the best bugs ever there are some comments about how bugs in these cartoons is basic meaning i guess that he is as yet not fully developed i actually prefer this basic version from the mid s chuck jones was the best version who is actually more rabbit sized and far more amusing than the eventual long legged version who towered over yosemite sam and daffy duck the latter day bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking also check out hair raising hare and rabbit punch for great examples of classic bugs and classic chuck jones 
chuck jones s hare conditioned is a fast paced often hilarious cartoon pitting bugs bunny against a strange yellow skinned apartment store manager who wants to have him stuffed hare conditioned takes full advantage of its multi purpose setting the chase takes bugs and his pursuer through a variety of departments leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing whatever clothes are associated with that part of the store this great gag is trumped however by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators in which bugs disguised as an elevator boy tricks the store manager into relentlessly getting on or off elevators at the wrong time it s a brilliant climactic set piece which unfortunately gives way to a not very funny final gag by that time however hare conditioned has made its mark as one of the great chase films bursting with wild energy as bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons from this period hare conditioned showed that he could still be just as appealing as a more anarchic character 
this is a documentary i came across by chance on the uk tv channel more and i have to say i found it extremely interesting and thought provoking i will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary basically this is professor jared diamond theory on why certain parts of the earth s societies prospered and others did not the argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one as for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses people have claimed his theory is marxist but i do not buy this and see it more socio geologist it was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion highly recommended viewing 
the documentary presents an original theory about guns germs and steel the series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory and defend the theory against common criticism i was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school indeed it does in fact i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis so if you like knowing why things work if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked you will enjoy this series a definite recommendation 
rock star inxs was the best music tv series i have ever watched it had some of the greatest rock n roll songs ever written performed by very talented singers performers it also had in my opinion the most heart felt feel good surprise endings in all of reality tv it actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner over the weeks of this televised competition the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants after some episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality tv show and the fact that inxs was and still is one of the greatest rock n roll bands ever just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series if you don t have the series recorded rock star inxs the dvd is a great alternative 
as has been well documented by previous posters the real stars of rockstar inxs and indeed it s sequel rockstar supernova are paul mirkovich rafael moreira jim mcgorman nate morton and sasha krivtsov don t know who they are they are the awesome tight rockin house band whose music savvy and talent made this show something more than a sad american idol clone remember the strings night that was musical precision and perfection if ever i ve seen it suzie mcneil s epic rendition of queen s bohemian rhapsody ty taylor s memorable cover of the stones you can t always get jd fortune singing suspicious minds the common denominator here is the awesome house band as good as inxs were in their prime they are sadly a shadow of their former selves though jd s live performance has somewhat breathed new life into their music this show is all about the hb memo to producers season three if we re blessed enough to have it happen should be rockstar house band get those boys a good lead singer and they are going places 
i don t quite know how to explain darkend room because to summarize it wouldn t really do it justice it s a quintessentially lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange mysterious situation i would say this short is definitely more on the mulholland drive end of the lynchian spectrum as opposed to the elephant man or the straight story it s hidden on lynch s website and well worth the search 
i really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one first of all i find this short film very entertaining and interesting i just take it for what it is i think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher one other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on no one else could have done that better than lynch this is the essence of lynchianism at its best sure i will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer s side will find themselves disappointed and in good right lynch is not about that at least this side of lynch is not the one that helped make lost highway mulholland dr is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else will just not get what this is all about my opinion is that darkened room is all about messing with your animal core your instinctual self by giving you the means image sound situation by which you instinctively react it s not about pleasure of any kind it s about getting the desired reaction out of you and that my friend is pure art 
this might be the wwe s nd best ppv of the year after wrestlemania it was a good suprise john cena had an excellent match in which he upset chris jericho jeff hardy retained his ic title in a short sloppy match with willam regal bubba spike dudley won a fairly violent tables match over benoit guerrero jamie noble had a really good match with kidman which was suprising to me booker t defeated the big show in a no dq match at one point booker t gave the scissors kick to big show and sent him right through the table in a stupid decision by the wwe christian and lance storm the jealous anti americans defeated hogan and edge with a lot of help from test and jericho rvd and brock had the match of the night it was filled with great high spots and rvd got to retain his ic title through a dq so i was happy he kept the title triple h also signed with eric bischoff and raw which means little to nothing and in the main event the rock became the first ever time wwe world champion defeating both kurt angle undertaker in a triple threat match overall this is probably the wwe s nd best ppv of 
david lynch s new short is a very lynchian piece full of darkness tension silences discreet but very textured background music and features again two beautiful actresses a blonde and a brunette a recurrent theme in his work both characters create a very intriguing slave mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same kind of relationship featured in mulholland dr beautiful for lynch fan s 
i am going to go out on a limb and actually defend shades of grey as a good clip show episode which delved into the life and death struggle of commander william thomas riker who was battling a terminally fatal disease the scenes from the flashback sequences were implemented quite well with the mood riker was in such as when he was reliving his romantic episodes such as angel one and up the long ladder tragic moments were highlighted such as tasha s death in skin of evil as well as elements of pulse pounding danger in heart of glory conspiracy and the aforementioned skin of evil riker also exhibited courage under fire by telling some humorous jokes such as an ancestor of mine was bitten by a rattlesnake once after days of intense pain the snake died this episode highlighted the psychological ordeal of will riker under extreme duress and yes i am biased in my opinion in proclaiming shades of grey as a solid episode because at the time of its original airing my face was covered in sweat wondering whether or not riker would pullout of it alive and live to see other great galactic outerspace adventures beyond the final frontier of course in subsequent years i seem to have formed a singular opinion of this particular episode but if an award should go for the best clip show episode in the history of television then i believe that this episode should be highly regarded in that respect 
this is quite the gripping fascinating tragic story quite good and for the most part pretty accurate considering it is a tv movie rather than a documentary they did create some fictional characters and combine several actual people into one character but otherwise this is a good telling of a very tragic and dark story the final moments of the movie depicting the mass suicide murder are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by jim jones this recording was made during the final minutes of the peoples temple s existence it is available in several places on the internet this portion of the film is almost spot on in that regard to sum up a documentary this is not however it does cover most of the base elements to the people s temple story 
powers booth is hypnotic as cult leader jim jones who led his peoples temple followers from until when he led them in a mass suicide in where over died a very well done movie which may seem a little dated due to the s time period but well worth the time of 
a well cast summary of a real event well actually i wasn t there but i think this is how it may have been like i think there are two typically american standpoints evident in the film communistophobia and parallels to adolf hitler these should be evident to most independent observers anyway boothe does a great performance and so do lots of other well known actors the last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable and i mean it anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal that s why it s so terrible it all happened and it probably looked just like that but actually did that last scene on the air station really take place 
many people know how it feels when a loved one is lost the feelings of pain grief and sorrow can be unbearable however sometimes it is the memories they leave behind that trigger the saddest emotions this theme is superbly portrayed in the short film tulip directed by the award winning australian actress rachel griffths described as a movie as much about memories as it is about love a string of sensitivity and sentimentality is expertly threaded into this triumphant minute film tulip is a beautifully wrought touching and heart warming story of a man s journey in coming to terms with the loss of his wife through the relationship he shares with a very special animal tulip the film opens with a rising dawn the chirping of birds and a vast landscape introducing the sense of rustic harmony present throughout the film a soft music plays marking the entrance of ruth jean bain she wears a flowered dress and apron with a sun hat on her head she gently pets tulip caressing her ears and patting her back the furnishing of the house is impressive and the attention to detail is creditable a vase of tulips can be seen on the bench reflecting the peaceful rural community will charles bud tingwell greets ruth as she is spooning the milk from the bucket they pour the milk and coffee together a sign of companionship and teamwork not a word is said but it is obvious that their relationship is close and affectionate they paint a perfect picture of happiness sadly happiness doesn t last forever the tragic passing of ruth affects will deeply an effective scene of fading cars highlights will s isolation and vulnerability at the end of the day of the funeral soon he sinks into depression and becomes oblivious to his surroundings when everything seems hopeless and lost at will s moment of despair tulip becomes the symbol of ruth the genuine connection will has with his late wife it was through tulip that will learns to cope with the absence of ruth and overcome the heartrending feelings of loneliness each of the characters is realistically and solidly portrayed especially the part of will charles bud tingwell brings the character to life through personal investment the recent loss of his own wife audrey tingwell is effectively reflected in his acting every sag of his shoulder and every frown on his brow make the viewer empathize strongly with the character the character of ruth is wonderfully carried out by jean bain although ruth does not say a single word throughout the movie her sweet personality and loving relationship with will are obvious lois ramsey and kati edwards give delightful performances in supporting roles as the friendly margaret and mary they also add a subtle humor to the bittersweet story an anecdote from griffths childhood the story of loss and discovery is remarkably captured in tulip beautifully shot and superbly acted this film will surely make you misty eyed triumphant or feel like drinking a cup of milk 
 sasquatch hunters actually wasn t as bad as i thought spoilers traveling into the woods park rangers charles landon kevin o connor roger gordon matt latimore brian stratton david zelina spencer combs rick holland and his sister janet stacey branscombe escort dr helen gilbert amy shelton white her boss dr ethan edwards gary sturm and assistant louise keaton juliana dever to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area when they make camp the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area when members of the group start to disappear they start to wander through the woods to safety it s discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings and the team band together to survive the good news this wasn t as bad as i thought it would be the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half way point when the creature attacks that is a masterful series of scenes as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature and the suspense throughout the entire play out is extremely high the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of off screen growls and roars that are truly unworldly they really do add much to make this part so creepy as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard it s quite effective and works well it s quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing as a man is running through the forest from the creature he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it raising his hands to holler to them for help the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing the bad news there was only a couple things to complain about here and one is a usual complaint the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it might ve had the air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen it s so distracting that it s a shame a little more work wasn t put into it i ve complained about this one a lot and is something that really should be done away with as it doesn t look that realistic and is quite fake another big one is the off screen kills in here very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away and then finding the bloody body afterward it s quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward otherwise i don t really have much of a problem with this one as everything else that s usually critiqued about this one didn t really bother me but it is called on for others beyond this stuff the final verdict i kinda liked this one but it s still not the best sasquatch movie ever it s not supposed to be taken seriously and if viewed that way it s actually quoit enjoyable fans of these films should give this one a look and those that like the sci fi creature features might find some nice things in here as well rated r graphic language violence and some graphic carcasses
fragglerock is excellent in the way that schindler s list was excellent a great watch for children and adults of all genders big noses can be seen as hinting towards phallic symbols in the same way that h r puff n stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking your kids will love this movie i enjoyed it very much as a child my father showed me this movie as a child he enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols although at the time i had no clue about what those were the movie is comedy and adventure the storyline is wacky and cheerful i and you shall enjoy this together 
everything was better in past days even children s television and fraggle rock proves my point quite easily at the time of writing this comment i am fourteen years old but even in my teen years i can t resist the charm of fraggle rock for those of you that have indeed been living under a rock haha fraggle rock is about a horde of playful and goofy creatures called fraggles who live amazingly in a rock but they re not the only creatures the rock is inhabited with many other species like the hardworking doozers and countless living plants outside the rock on one side live inventor scientist doc and his dog sprocket who later befriends gobo fraggle on the other side a family of gorgs supposed rulers of the universe the five main fraggles gobo fearless leader mokey arty and peaceful wembley indecisive and a friend to gobo boober a pessimistic domestic god and red loves anything to do with sport and general feistyness get caught up in some strange situations each episode while at the same time sing and dance their cares away fraggle rock is definitely a family show the plots may have intricate details that infants may not follow well but the song and dance routines will hold their attention the characters are strong and likable their conflicts believable and their adventures thrilling the gorgs are frightening doc and sprocket enlightening uncle travelling matt hilarious the postcard segments are very s and the final episode change of address genuinely touching let s go down to fraggle rock again 
after seeing dick tracy in the bin at future shop i decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of mafia and crime movies i was very surprised to see a very fun smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout the movie moves along well it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty but the real standouts of the film are al pacino and madonna i was happy to find out that pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city madonna was great as the damsel in distress she really impressed me and added depth to her performance if you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give dick tracy a try i don t think you will be disappointed and watch for the cameos from paul sorvino james caan kathy bates and dustin hoffman among others 
at one end of the eighties warren beatty created and starred in the literate epic reds about the founding of the soviet union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical john reed it was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast at the end of the decade warren beatty created another kind of epic in dick tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup that both reds and dick tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player in this film beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay the city s top mobster big boy caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition the film opens with him rubbing out lips manlis s henchmen in a valentine massacre style shooting and then lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat but caprice s moves are making him a target for tracy in the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple caprice himself will our hero sort out this thicket of crime the spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious when people like al pacino dustin hoffman paul sorvino william forsythe r g armstrong get themselves outrageously made up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author chester gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham you ve got to love this film al pacino got a nomination for best supporting actor but any of these guys could have it s only that pacino as big boy caprice gets the most screen time only beatty plays it completely straight the others all seem to play off of him dick tracy won oscars for best art set design best song written by stephen sondheim and introduced by madonna sooner or later the fact he was even able to get somebody like sondheim to write a score for this film only shows sondheim wanted to get in on the fun as for madonna the material girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer breathless mahoney before this film dick tracy movies were consigned to the b pictures and worse as saturday afternoon serials the only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for armed forces radio during world war ii that got to vinyl can you believe a cast like bing crosby bob hope frank sinatra dinah shore jimmy durante judy garland frank morgan and the andrews sisters try and find a recording of that gem until then warren beatty s classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely 
 tulip is on the australian all shorts video from tribe first rites showcasing the talents of first time directors i wish more scripts had such excellent dialogue i hope rachel griffiths has more stories to tell she does it so well 
i still liked it though warren beatty is only fair as the comic book hero what saves this movie is the set the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script i really expected something more substantial in the terms of action or plot but i got very little the main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in hollywood at the time in such an unusual film the one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was madonna she did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad the movie at some points just stood still you expected something more and you got nothing al pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good he and beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy it is also interesting to see dustin hoffman and warren beatty in a film other than isthar i did not see ishtar but i heard bad things the thing about this movie is it is good but it could have been so much better i liked it as a child because i thought it looked cool and visually the movie is amazing the sets are incredible the writing is only fair and with such a cast in the movie i would expect a little better anyway spoiler i especially thought the finale was not big enough it was interesting but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere the movie only uses the comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway the costumes and makeup were flawless as well the facial makeup for the villains was great beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character still this is a good movie that could have been much much more it is to me better than batman the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross 
dick tracy was originally a comic book created in by chester gould he is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a crew of villains ranging from all types of visually original characters such as flattop to the blank to big boy caprice these villains became so popular in the s that warner bros created their own take on the tracy style villains in such cartoons as daffy duck tracy s comics were known for their liberal use of gunplay and the up to date technology advances notably the wristwatch communicator which got their fair share of screen time on this excellent movie the music was done wonderfully by danny elfman and the original songs by madonna were interesting but they were not the high point for her career it s weird because as you watch the film and see the suspenseful moments the film feels so much like batman because of elfman s memorable sound to his pieces i love the tough talking kid pacino s acting as big boy caprice and that chin madonna s take on villainy and the cinematography and directing were impeccable this film was very professionally made and features tons of great actors who were known as great actors for a while before this film was made warren beatty al pacino william forsythe dustin hoffman kathy bates mandy patinkin catherine o hara dick van dyke the film was directed by beatty himself which was interesting it is almost like beatty saw himself as tracy in a past life or something because he really fit the part i had to give this film an for everything that it brought to cinema that got overlooked for whatever reason there have been tons of misunderstandings over the rating of this movie on imdb and i still don t understand why the characters were completely original and vibrant as was the style of the sets wardrobe lighting and everything in this film go buy it today you will not be sorry 
this movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel the sets costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book this is the movie i think of when the mob is mentioned the suits the hats and the attitudes hoffman gives comic relief as mumbles and you can t help but feel sorry for madonna as she tries and fails to win tracy over this movie contains all the classic mob clich s burying people in concrete blowing up peoples cars tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house this movie is a classic in ever sense of the word even camera angels cry out comic book its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as spawn and the hulk you have to see this movie 
that was great fun i never read those chester gould comics but it s not necessary to know them maybe there were some inside jokes i didn t figure out but what the eye doesn t see the heart cannot grieve over this is such an ironic colourful film and the actors are good humoured all together the setting is similar to that in the batman` movies but not as dark and grey okay the story is not so original but there is a plot which is not self evident and a more or less surprising ending with this movie you could play an interesting game if you watch it with friends don t watch the credits at the beginning and then look who s the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their make up 
i saw dick tracy when i was very young i didn t know who any of the actors were and i didn t know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed i sure loved it though warren beatty stars as the crime fighting s detective dick tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city this time big boy caprice al pacino has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney madonna who has her eye on tracy it becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is this criminal has no face he or she is very unknown plus the famous villians are back from the comic book collection i thought that this movie was very colorful and creative it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child warren beaty was just like james bond of the s the way he played dick tracy an ensemble cast of the film includes charlie korsmo glenn headly william forsythe dustin hoffman james caan ed o ross tommy lee jones mandy patinkin charles durning plus more dick tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy take my word for it 
most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog the tim burton batmans had it as did in an even more grotesque manner sin city with dick tracy producer director star warren beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework like a boisterous homage to s gangster pictures only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker bonnie and clyde dick tracy is filled joyfully with archetypes and bright primary colors where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities villains like the stooge shoulders lips the brow mumbles the blank pruneface spud chester gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass the film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously if at the time movies like batman and underrated teenage mutant ninja turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic book outline dick tracy is more old school it s a story of cops and crooks or rather a cop detective tracy as he tries to bust big boy al pacino in what is arguably his biggest performance to date and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style but with no such luck there s also a little kid called simply the kid charlie korsmo who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would ve been imagined and tracy s love interest in tess and then there s the nightclub dame madonna who probably doesn t give any kind of great acting performance but maybe that suits the role fine and she sings excellently when called upon who wont testify unless tracy admits feelings he doesn t have for her then there s convoluted dealings with taking tracy down and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice meantime as if doing an impersonation of a howard hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions dick tracy adds on the wink and nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes it s a wonder to look at this world which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers i e sin city which can be justifiably compared to beatty s film we re driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line or whatever there is of it in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old i m almost reminded of the cotton club during these sequences as story music detail and a few big punches and gun shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said which actually isn t more than it needs to and there s a heap load of catchy dialog from the script one of my favorites the enemy of my enemy is my enemy plus any of pacino s references to other figures in quotes revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater and only remembering little bits dick tracy is a hard boiled fantasy to the finest degree it s filled with good cheer for the kids and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic book movies i e pg fare and for the adults its throw back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle even dustin hoffman hams it up and he barely says an audible word 
rachel griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film a heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those we ve loved and lost although only minutes long griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time bud tingwell gives a touching performance as will a widower struggling to cope with his wife s death will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of ruth s pet cow tulip the film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost good cinematography great direction and superbly acted it will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one and survived 
heh if i tell you to compare the dark knight with some years old comics adapted movie rated will you call me crazy that s just to catch your attention everyday i meet people complaining there are no good movies who seem to only know the recent blockbusters it s never a bad thing to search and explore old movies especially those with good artistic values dick tracy is one of those can t be easily outdated in terms of technology the negative reviews mainly complained about dt s messed up story but it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear and i had no problem following it i didn t see the comic books yet i am not a huge us comic fan but i appreciate the top notch film making and performances maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell but if you see a movie casting madonna and warren beatty together what would you expect i had some scratches on my head and can t help but wonder did we really see the same movie the title role although not as competent as it sounds still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences madonna was more express less than breathless in her seductive role but added a lot of fun to the story al pacino was funny and prodigy to himself apparently he s bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles we can see a hybrid of scarface michael corleone adolf hitler and robert de niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh and many thanks to make ups to me it s not bad at all the surreal feeling really got me 
i never attended the midnight showing of a movie before dick tracy came out i still have the t shirt ticket i had to wear to get admitted to the showing around here somewhere and like that shirt dick tracy has stuck with me ever since if you ve seen the movie the sharp visuals bright primary colors and strong characters have no doubt been etched into your brain it s a wonder to behold as director star co writer producer beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here taking a familiar american icon and re creating him for a whole new era still set in the s tracy has a kind of timeless quality like all good films do i ve lost track of how many times i ve watched tracy and i still catch something new every time i do the others are all top notch starting with pacino s big boy caprice a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them even madonna s breathless mahoney is a relevation in that under the right environment she can act gasp but there s still such themes touched on as the necessity of family keeping true to one s self good versus evil even machiavellian themes are explored odd for a comic strip film but hey it works all in all dick tracy is a classic unto itself compared with other films of this decade it makes a strong statement it s a good strong film that doesn t depend on blood violence profanity or nudity to make its point there s a lesson to be learned here ten stars great scott 
 dick tracy is one of our family s favorites the actors are great the art direction is exceptional the music is magic it s not supposed to be to kill a mockingbird it s a fun experience stephen sondhemim s songs are stellar back in business is energetic sooner or later is just right what can you lose is haunting even tunes like live alone and like it add to the story got to love the giddily over the top performances of al pacino dustin hoffman glenn headly charlie korsmo mandy patinkin james caan dick van dyke supporting villains the list is far too long and yes even madonna and warren beatty are awesome written with a smile a minute how many times have we looked at each other and said wait a minute i m having a thought it s gone however one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer so if you haven t already why not give dick tracy a chance accept it for what it is a sunday comic strip brought to life and in a wonderful way 
i hope she can keep acting and directing she s surely up to the task and could easily develop that visionary streak into a long career of unconventional and rare works of art her work has a rare kind of generosity and her timing is spot on oy i m kvell
despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation this is probably one of most uninspiring disney films i ve seen and i don t slam disney films very often spirit is a wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured either by the cavalry or by indians both of which try to break him spirit ends up forming a bond with the indian and that in a nutshell is the story with exception to the beautiful animation of the horses neither i or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film it s ironic that it s titled spirit as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of an extra point was given for the soundtrack which was enjoyable with songs by bryan adams and hans zimmer and although this film is rated g you will still probably have to end up explaining what breaking a horse means to your five year old i did 
while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer i was in for a deep surprise with this film while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too cartoonish the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience instead of the feel good happy story this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing most kids won t understand some of the darker moments in the film which makes this film rather watchable for adults i was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts the musical score was once again solid proving hans zimmer is the go to guy when it comes to animated scores and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian adams music 
this is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways everyone in my family enjoyed it the animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are plenty of producers who create films that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from the disney studio one difference from the normal disney fare is that this dreamworks movie does not feature some wise cracking side kick for comedy relief and there are no sudden moments where the characters break into song i am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a disney picture the birth of spirit but it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all spirit was a great breath of fresh air don t get me wrong i have loved disney for years and will continue to do so spirit is another example of great animated fare as soon as it was over my kids wanted to watch it again i had the same feeling i thoroughly recommend it 
this is one of the most calming relaxing and beautifully made animation films i ve ever seen with beautiful music throughout the movie the sounds and music can make you feel like you re in the movie this movie is not just great for kids but adults too it teaches you lessons such as never forget who you are you can do whatever you stick your mind to and to brave and daring this movie can make you cry at times too which is always a nice touch in movies this movie is funny sad cute and keeps you on the edge of your seat some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them and the movie spirit is definitely one of them with my vote of stars for animation music and a wonderful idea for a movie it gave me a whole lot of spirit 
i began riding horses fairly recently and as anyone who has ever ridden should know i fell in love with horses and their world i rented spirit on a whim just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as i could and i was surprised by the results what i expected was a feel good disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes what i got was an amazing film filled with beautiful scenery and animation and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one s heart spirit is a wild mustang in the old west whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland the story unfolds with a wide array of characters some human some animals all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story and who has an appreciation for history and animals one thing i forgot to mention but that i feel is important is that the animals in this film do not talk this was a really nice vacation from the lady and the tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to 
i really dislike both shrek films since their both pg and have words in them i would never say myself so i disliked them but when it comes to spirit stallion of the cimarron which i just barely watched for the first time last month i became a fan of animated films other than pixar spoilers ahead in spirit stallion of the cimarron a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard one night he sees a strange light in the distance and he sets off toward it this action eventually leads to his capture and several more things throughout the movie we hear a narration it s through the thoughts of spirit though the horses never talk this is what makes the movie so goo they the movie makers recored real horses to do the sounds the horses made none of those sounds were made by humans spirit meets rain a beautiful mare and little creek a native american who owns rain little creek later frees spirit and rain they go running home i have never been a big fan of brian adams but i intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future watch this film and you won t regret it my score 
i liked this movie a lot the animation was well done and the romance was cute i liked most of bryan adams songs and the hans zimmer score was excellent what a lot of people don t realize is how well it relates to the heart of darkness apocalypse now themes what happens when so called civilization invades someone elses home what does it mean to be civilized etc the opening scenery and music were very stirring the film is a lament to an america that was once beautiful 
the horse is indeed a fine animal picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation flick the animation is simply stupendous the fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses embolden across the flick more so when the stallion traverses diverse terrain jumps across cliffs and braves waters soundtrack too is very impressive the wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie they say the story of the west was written from the saddle of a horse huh well the story of a fine horse sure was written from the saddle of the west all in all this movie is clearly up there with the best it is one of the best animation flicks i have watched would be a very fine choice on a lonely night an easy 
well what can i say this movie really got to me it s not so bad as many say i really loved it although the idea seems so simple and rather boring it isn t first of all i enjoyed the soundtrack bryan adams it really goes with the movie second the simple story and the drama of spirit gets your attention one thing i like the most is that they didn t give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses it makes the movie more realistic not many animations seem realistic now do they but i don t know making animals talk is just so lame one of the most beautiful animations of in my opinion i recommend it to everyone not just the kids because it is very relaxing 
if only all animation was this great this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects story and character the characters in this film are beautifully personified i felt for all of the characters and human animal relationship in the movie works perfectly the beautiful animation and d computer animation hasn t worked better in any other film this is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero s journey of 
i have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of spirit the best thing about the movie i think is that the animals isn t able to talk this makes the whole movie more honest and makes a better impression on both kids and the adults so from the kids and me
in a time when hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses despair crime drugs and war along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the indomitable spirit if you are feeling beaten down this movie will free your mind and set you soaring we all know how tough life can be sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through that s what this film did for me and i hope it will for you 
wow something of a surprise though flawed it is far better that i expected the brand new space liner arcturus with some passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to jupiter without warning the ship s cerebral central computer sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate soon there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ship s astrogators penny the captain cary and the director of the shipping line kenyon it turns out that the alarm was false and that the main cerebral is acting erratically the remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship and avoid personal conflicts in order to survive the film starts out very well the opening commercial is a very nice touch there are obvious parallels to a space odyssey and to the historic sinking of the titanic the film does slow down at times and has pacing problems but is generally well made and well acted 
this movie has it all it is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of cuban refugees antonio montana played by al pacino is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in america this cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of miamis drug empire is astonishing brian depalma does an amazing job directing this picture so much that the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline as well as every character in the cast with tony s characters pressence being so believable and strong brian depalma brang out the raw talent exposed by steven bauer manny tony s best friend mary elizabeth mastantonio gina tony s sister robert loggia frank tony s boss and michelle pfeiffer elvira frank s wife i enjoyed every minute watching this movie and still watch it on a weekly basis on this year the th anniversary of this classic crime movie i for one am a true believer that in another years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers with other crime movies being so dramatic i find this movie is a shock to the system 
for whoever play games video games here did anybody notice that the gta vice city mansion inside the game and some other things including weapons from the movie that are connected to this movie and this movie inspired the makers of the game rockstar games to copy some things from this movie and by the way this is one of the best s movies out there i recommend this for anybody who still didn t see it no questions asked
perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if it s not it s certainly one of those who are burned onto your pupils as what brian de palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork first there is the director s touch of brian de palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever there is the superb performance from al pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen tony montana there are the many different violent scenes that you will never forget the one with the chainsaw the one in where tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most people s living rooms there are the many superb one liners count how many times the word f ck is used there are the superb little details the pan american globe that screams the world is yours or the great discomusic from giorgio moroder nothing can be named that isn t sublime here and it easily is along with the godfather good fellas and white heat one of the best gangstermovies ever made 
surely one of the mysteries of the modern world this film is not considered to be within the top films of all time if you watched this film and thought it was anything other than wonderful please let me know how al pacino s performance is as good as it gets 
if you like gangster type of movies then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent al pacino his performance is top notch and the story is classic why isn t this movie in the top list 
this is one of my favorite films of all time al pacino acting is at its best and the story is excellent too bad it didn t do to well in the s when it was first released because people didn t get a chance to experience this classic 
 a classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read a classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read mark twain classic seems to be the word used to describe scarface brian depalma s film about opulence self surrender greed and danger among florida s drug ring people and critics and rappers for that matter deem this film an epic gangster classic or eptiome of gangster films when it is anything but it is praised for all the wrong reasons scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over but not all the praise it gets from audiences today and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public first off the film is about a cuban refugee with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness simple yes but the layers of de palma s directing genius and the great story written by oliver stone yes i know he actually wrote a real good one here play into all of it the characters are all looking for an escape as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all each character has something to offer that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film they are entwined in a world of mystique and money but all that has a price as they all learn each character thinks they are getting better chances in life when in true dramatic irony they are actually getting worse tragedy would be a better word to describe this movie all those who praise the film for it s drug usage it s violence it s dialog totally missed the point there is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves and that is why the film works so well the devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film not to look cool or attract viewers brian de palma doesn t make movies for cult gangsters or brainless action fans next on the film is an adult drama it is not a gangster film it has it s share of action but the action is plotted very carefully so it has a point it s not like aliens an example of a big dumb action film and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people ridiculous hogwash if this film is about that then it is about how bad it is not a promotion of it this being said the film is indeed a great film it has great cinematography that pulls you into the story it has a very dramatic score in true giorgio moroder style which simply could give you chills or bring you to tears the film is rather lengthy but it is a story and each moment counts the acting is terrific al pacino enough said he can do any role that he puts his mind to and this was no exception pretty boy steven bauer as manny i didn t think much of him in other films he did but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro de palma s direction michelle pfeiffer is a true gem as elvira popping fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in grease she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye but the three true diamonds in this rough are mary elizabeth mastrontonio as tony s sister gina who when she smiles or cries we see her soul and her fresh way of living and watch it deteriorate paul shenar as alejandro sosa a drug lord who runs deeper than a river and shenar portrays him as so and miriam colom as tony and gina s torn mother these three dig the film as deep as it can go this reviewer learned one main thing when watching scarface for the first time always go into a film unsuspecting all the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see only knowing de palma like i do can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds so ignore the rap crap ignore the mindless violence supporters and fix yourself a glass of bailey s on the rocks and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film the real scarface 
this is one of my all time favorites if the movie has a flaw it s that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesn t so much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewer s imagination moroder s languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee like the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails and gnashes broods and tugs a constant reminder of tony s inexorable fate not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train 
i saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it i was very moved by this movie i found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault as in real life though sometimes people disappoint as was the case with leo who even though i liked his character i could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his hiv status i was also disappointed with leo for rejecting the medicine available to him and the awful way he treated marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train i think this movie showed in a very real way why hiv numbers are up in young gay men this is in no way meant to bash gays i am gay and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others the only part of the movie i couldn t understand was why the gay friendly family was unwilling to include marcel in leo s illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral i think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is do not have unprotected sex 
i found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis when leo the oldest announces that he is hiv the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange i have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one nor one as likely to shout at each other i didn t understand why the family felt that youngest couldn t deal with the news but once past that difficult i found this a thoroughly moving film 
this film made for french tv deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family when leo the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the aids virus announces it to his parents they just can t believe it the film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject the director christophe honore has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen nowhere but in france could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter the news has a devastating effect on marcel the young brother who hears about what leo has contracted in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality yaniss lespart and pierre mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers 
it was very heart warming as an expatriated french i particularly enjoyed this tv movie which i think deserves a broader distribution the acting was good and the bonds between each member of this rural french family seemed so strong and so natural no doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and aids one of the strongest aspect of the movie is this privileged relationship between the eldest son leo who has contracted hiv and the youngest son marcel to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation the two characters progressively explore each other as time runs out for leo who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs 
a truly adorable heroine who at turns is surprised and terrified by giblets wrestles with mattresses runs full on into closed doors just a few of the moments that sparkle in my memory of the naked truth i loved what i caught of this show enjoyably daft plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show tea leoni as nora wilde cute clownish and wonderfully accident prone how refreshing to see an actress who can clown it s no wonder hollyood doesn t seem to know how to cast her but where oh where are the dvd releases the amount of bleep they release it s incredible me that this little gem continues to remain buried someone please correct me if i m wrong 
tea leoni plays nora wilde a serious photographer who is going through a bad divorce she wants her freedom but it comes at a cost she wants to legitimate photography but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi her boss is played by the wonderful and divine holland taylor the show was well written most of the time tea s nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just didn t support comedy and they still don t even when they brought in george wendt from cheers they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters the show was fine in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it but then the network botches it up like a bad plastic surgery 
this movie is a perfect portrayal of the nutcracker the dancing is wonderful the scenery in the background was excellent and i loved that floating bed oh and the costumes i particularly loved marzipan s the tutu was adorable the special effects were very well done e g the tree the bed etc and i quite enjoyed the rats i love how they didn t make them scary but cute and huggable except for the king i suppose if you re a thoroughly masculine person you won t enjoy this but this is a very good movie that s good for all ages just not all levels of testosterone but i have a few complaints firstly why did they have to put the sugar plum fairy s partner in those terrible tights it would barely make a difference if he was butt naked and secondly why on earth did they have to make culkin s outfit pink 
the last hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to deal with buffalo hunting both as a sport and business and as a method of winning the plains indian wars before the white man set foot on the other side of the mississippi the plains used to have herds of american bison as large as some of our largest cities by the time of the period the last hunt is set in the buffalo had been all but wiped out the th century due to the efforts of conservationists saw a revival in population of the species but not hardly like it once was robert taylor and stewart granger are co starring in a second film together and this one is far superior to all the brothers were valiant here stewart granger is the good guy a world weary buffalo hunter who has to go back to a job he hates because of financial considerations the partner he s chosen to throw in with is robert taylor forgetting taylor for the moment i doubt if there s ever been a meaner nastier soul than charlie gilsen who taylor portrays in devil s doorway he was an american indian fighting against the prejudice stirred up by a racist played by louis calhern in the last hunt he s the racist here he kills both buffalo and indians for pure pleasure he kills one indian family when they steal his mules and takes the widow of one captive like some barbarian conqueror he expects the pleasure of debra paget s sexual favors he s actually mad when paget doesn t see it that way no matter how often they refer to russ tamblyn as a halfbreed i was never really convinced he was any part indian it s the only weakness i found in the last hunt however lloyd nolan the grizzled old buffalo skinner taylor and granger bring along is just great nolan steals every scene he s in with the cast for those who like their westerns real who want to see a side of robert taylor never seen on screen and who don t like cheap heroics the last hunt is the ideal hunt 
released as zentropa in north america to avoid confusion with agniezska holland s own holocaust film europa europa this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise inspire or downright shock is a bizarre nostalgic elaborate film about a naive american in germany shortly following the end of wwii the american named leo doesn t fully get what he s doing there he has come to take part in fixing up the country since in his mind it s about time germany was shown some charity no matter how that sounds he is not a nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro german merely mixed up his uncle who works on the railroad gets leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of germany s horrors and enigmas this progression starts when leo played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor jean marc barr meets a sultry heiress on the train played by barbara sukowa an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor she seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family which owns the company which manufactures the trains these were the precise trains that took jews to their deaths during the war but now they run a drab day to day timetable and the woman s uncle kessler postures as another one of those good germans who were just doing their jobs there is also udo kier the tremendous actor who blew me away in von trier s shocking second film epidemic though here he is mere scenery another guest at the house is eddie constantine an actor with a quiet strength playing a somber american intelligence man he can confirm that uncle kessler was a war criminal though it is all completely baffling to leo americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than leo who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train the story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film s danish director lars von trier whose anchor is in the film s breathtaking editing and cinematography he shoots in black and white and color he uses double exposures optical effects and trick photography having actors interact with rear projected footage he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects caught between glass for our more precise survey this grand jury prize winning surrealist work is allegorical but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer i interpret it as a film about the last legs of nazism symbolized by the train and the ethical accountability of americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads during the time frame of the movie and the nazi state and such significance to the train are dead but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes the characters music dialogue and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions the most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones two trains halting back and forth barr on one and sukowa on another an underwater shot of proliferating blood an uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown and most metaphysically affecting of all an anesthetic shot of train tracks as max von sydow s voice allures us to hark back to europe with him and abandon our personal restraint 
both visually and musically stunning a treat for both the eye and the ear the quintessential victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting helping to create a christmas scene of which dickens himself would have been justifiably proud technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting the dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good the photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed a great film for all the family at christmas time and a most delightful discovery which will withstand multiple viewing 
as far as i can recall balanchine s alterations to tchaikovsky s score are as follows the final section of the grossvatertanz a traditional tune played at the end of a party is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is over a violin solo written for but eliminated from tchaikovsky s score for the sleeping beauty is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship to the music for the growing christmas tree that occurs shortly thereafter the solo for the sugar plum fairy s cavalier is eliminated it seems to me the accusation that balanchine has somehow desecrated tchaikovsky s great score is misplaced 
i was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the maryland film festival i ve always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the gimmicks of william castle so this was definitely a must see for me this is about the life and work of william castle who in my opinion was an underrated director true he made some cheap budget schlocky horror films but he added something to these films real live theater gimmicks that you don t see anymore for example he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack at his movies and put vibrators at the bottoms of chairs in the tingler this is truly a well made documentary and brings this rather shadowed director into the light and celebrated his contributions to horror cinema it also paints castle as a larger than life character who was very well liked and had a smile on his face unlike most film documentaries that mostly show testaments from film historians spine tingler shows interviews mostly from his family members and directors who were influenced by his work such as john waters john landis and joe dante a must see for classic horror and sci fi fans 
for some reason this film has never turned up in its original language in my neck of the woods despite owning the tcm uk cable channel which broadcasts scores of mgm titles week in week out more disappointingly it s still m i a on dvd even from warners recently announced western classics collection box set which does include other robert taylor genre efforts maybe they re saving it for an eventual signature collection devoted to this stalwart of mgm which may be coming next year in time for the th anniversary of his passing i say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish westerner with a fanatical hatred of indians and who opts to exploit his expert marksmanship by making some easy money hunting buffaloes an opening statement offers the alarming statistic that the population of this species was reduced from to in the space of just years as an associate taylor picks on former professional of the trade stewart granger who rallies alcoholic peg legged lloyd nolan who continually taunts the irascible and vindictive taylor and teenage half breed russ tamblyn to this end as expected the company s relationship is a shaky one reminiscent of that at the centre of anthony mann s the naked spur another bleak open air mgm western the film in fact ably approximates the flavor and toughness of mann s work in this field despite being writer director brooks first of just a handful of such outings but which cumulatively exhibited a remarkable diversity here too the narrative throws in a female presence debra paget also a half breed to be contended between the two rugged leads and granger like the james stewart of the naked spur returns to his job only grudgingly his remorse at having to kill buffaloes for mere sport and profit is effectively realized the latter also suffers in seeing taylor take paget for himself she bravely but coldly endures his approaches while secretly craving for granger and lets out his frustration on the locals at a bar while drunk taylor himself doesn t come out unscathed from the deal like the protagonist of the treasure of the sierra madre he becomes diffident and jealous of his associates especially with respect to a rare and therefore precious hide of a white buffalo they ve caught he even goes buffalo crazy at one point as nolan had predicted becoming deluded into taking the rumble of thunder for the hooves of an approaching mass of the species the hunting scenes themselves are impressive buffaloes stampeding tumbling to the ground when hit the endless line up of the day s catch and the carcasses which subsequently infest the meadows the film s atypical but memorable denouement then is justly famous with winter in full swing a now paranoid taylor out for granger s blood lies in wait outside a cave in which the latter and paget have taken refuge to shoot him when granger emerges the next morning he discovers taylor in a hunched position frozen to death incidentally my father owns a copy of the hefty source novel of this by milton lott from the time of the film s original release actually he has collected a vast number of such editions it is after all a practice still in vogue where a book is re issued to promote its cinematic adaptation likewise for the record taylor and granger who work very well off each other here had already been teamed as sibling whale hunters in the seafaring adventure all the brothers were valiant which curiously enough is just as difficult to see in fact even more so considering that it s not even been shown on italian tv for what seems like ages 
you know this movie isn t that great but i mean c mon it s about angels helping a baseball team i find the plot line to be hilarious anyways this kid s dad says he ll take him back if the angels win the pennant because he knows they won t kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win god helps the whole time via the angel christopher lloyd rip and in the end his dad doesn t take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face it s hilarious until danny glover adopts it and it s friend i guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin projects and her stories the real winner here though is god because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows as a kids movie it gets a as a movie about the mysteries of blind stupid faith and the nature of god it gets a 
but how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can t win for george knox it is not easy as the movie opens roger beaumont joseph gordon levitt and his best friend j p milton davis jr are riding on thier bikes around the angels stadium when they return to thier foster mother s home roger is suprised to have a visit from his dad dermot mulroney his mom is dead and when he asks his father when they going to be a family again he father jokes i say when the angels win the division championship so later on roger and j p hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball when the manger george knox danny glover take out his pitcher the pitcher gets mad and gets into a fight with him and soon the angels team get into the fightm that gets knox ejected from the game that night roger makes a prayer for the angles win the championship when his foster mother maggie nelson brenda ficker agrees that roger and j p go to a basball roger sees real angles come on the field and helps the left fielder matthew mcconaughey makes a catch that leaves the manger and the play by play man jay o sanders how did he to that roger learns from the head angel christopher lloyd that only he can see the angles because he was the only that prayed for help 
with all the adult innuendos in todays family movies its nice to see one where you don t have to worry about that and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids yes this movie might have a few swear words there s that time where knox swears but they don t let you hear the full words but for the most part this movie is truly as clean as they come and that s including movies from back in the day not only that its very enjoyable one of my favorites and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family the only thing i have against this movie is that it is too short and i wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are in it i m not going to mention them because i don t want any spoilers here all in all nicely done and a great movie to watch so go out and get the kids make some cookies and watch this movie 
yeah the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever i see it that s just brilliant joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life the way he interacts with danny glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating a very nice family movie with i concede a rather corny happy end but hey it doesn t really matter the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes 
 angels in the outfield was originally a movie from the ted turner library disney remade it in this time using the california angels now the los angeles angels as the team disney used to own this and the anaheim mighty ducks hockey team also good use of the words huh this movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family a man promised the boys a family only if the angels won the pennant so he called upon god one night about this the boy who prayed could see the help coming on the way and only that boy for instance when the first angel had come down a player hit a ball so hard not only did the bat break so did the ball for much of the post all star season of the angels were at the top of the al west of which my home team the rangers is one and it still is however they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the white sox angels game there was no central division in baseball back then hence chicago being in the west and no angels were there to help thus a new rule was created no angels can help in championship games but wait in the final championship game the angels won it was a miracle indeed what i liked about this film this is a good movie i mean i prayed every night for the last few years asking for help with school and stuff look at me now my work was good so for one this shows that if you believe god can send his angels down to help you with any troubles that you may have in life and second this is a family baseball movie which is always exciting this is an old disney movie too i ve seen this just recently on the new disney channel blech angels in the outfield will change your life forever once you ve seen it 
this movie is perfect for families to watch together it is a great film and it deserves more credit the special effects are stunning and spectacular everyone who has children should share this with theirs 
this movie was one of the best disney movies i ve ever seen great for the entire family to watch the ideas may be a little far fetched but it s a feel good comedy and the acting is great love the little boy j p and academy award winner adrien brody s part may have been very short but very memorable highly recommended 
one of disney s best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for hour forty two minutes and after all wasn t movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast sparkles with delight magictrain
i have to say despite it s reviews angels in the outfield was a pretty good movie i like the fact how it teaches kids to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack which was very interesting though i liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy i e towards the end when ray mitchell hits a homer he doesn t step on the plate and therefore that wouldn t be a score but that s just nitpicking i have to say i was really impressed with this movie s presence and moral just have faith don t give up 
one piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business at the time in this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history and may continue to hold it was held in pittsburgh pennsylvania no doubt in honor of the original film s angels who haunted the pittsburgh pirates in this remake they haunt the california angels anyway the premiere was held at the long gone three rivers stadium which was the home of the pittsburgh pirates and the pittsburgh steelers at the time the pirates are now housed in pnc park and the steelers at heinz field the premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held and may even continue to hold the record for the largest movie premiere in history shown to fans danny glover tony danza and christopher lloyd were all in attendance to the admiration of thousands of sports fans 
i enjoy movies like this for their spirit no pun intended its a decent clean movie about a baseball team that s falling behind and a young fan wishes for them to win since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he d come back for him the spirit shines through in two ways a funny cast with danny glover and a young joseph gordon levitt and the heavenly herald al taking the dynamic form of christopher lloyd its an energetic movie it gets you smiling and really involves you in the sport therein lies my gripe the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team there s absolutely nothing wrong with that i just find it odd that i should come away from the movie thinking the angels are a strong cool team when really my base loyalty such as it is lies with the toronto blue jays it s interesting really if it s just a movie about an underdog kids team then its okay 
i have always like this great baseball movie it has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of my favorites danny glover and christopher lloyd also in this movie is ben johnson brenda fricker big tony longo tony danza and matthew mcconaughey also jay o sanders and dermot mulroney the film has great special effects and acting from all of the film s actors the baseball scenes are all realistic the music by composer randy edelman is very good and it fits the film very well some of the actors who reminded me the actual baseball personalities stoney jackson s ray mitchell character reminded me royce clayton mcconaughey s character reminded me of steve finley and jay o sanders s commentator in my opinion resembled how al hrabosky looks today this is a fantastic movie for non and baseball fans and i strongly recommend this film 
the memory of the the last hunt has stuck with me since i saw it in when i was it is a movie that was far ahead of others at the time in that it addressed the treatment of the natives the environment and the ever present contrast between the short and long term effects of greed it is as relevant today as in a cinemagraphic discussion of utmost depth and relevance to top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent the memory of this movie will be with me to the end of my days 
 scarlett johansson woody allen hugh jackman ian mcshane romola garia directed by woody allen just after his work with johansson on match point the two return for scoop a corky zany and fun comic ride when a student reporter johansson finds out a new scoop from a deceased reporter mcshane when she enters the materializer of a lame magician allen the scoop being of the new tarot card killer in london who might be preppy peter lyman jackman while sondra and sid are playing detective sondra falls in love for the handsome would be killer allen has finally hit a mark not as good as match point but definitely more fun i laughed a lot more than i expected one of the years must sees
 match point and now scoop have both convinced me that not only is woody allen doing a neat job making movies in england and that scarlett johansson is the right cast member but corroborated what i have known for years he shouldn t focus on neurotic rich new yorkers in this case johansson plays journalism student sondra pransky whom magician sid waterman allen puts in his disappearing box where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter joe strombel ian mcshane who tells her that the serial killings that have plagued london were committed by millionaire peter lyman hugh jackman so she gets to know him and well i don t know how much i can tell you without giving it away but i can say that this is probably allen s funniest movie in years there s his ubiquitous unique style of humor especially the line about his religion so you re sure to like this movie if nothing else it ll make you fall in love with london but mostly it s just so damn hilarious even if you don t like woody allen you gotta love this one 
woody allen s second movie set in london tha tarot card murderer is killing prostitutes in london aspiring journalist sondra pransky scarlett johansson gets a tip that he may be lord peter lyman hugh jackman she starts to romance him but quickly falls in love she s helped by stage magician sid waterman woody allen who doesn t like what he sees i like this better than the over rated match point from last year it was shorter and moved much more quickly the plot is old but i was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end it s not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines all from allen of course it s not one of allen s best but it s far better than his worst the acting is for the most part very good allen is bad but he s played this character a million times before and it s gotten tiresome but johansson and jackman are just great they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances also allen surprisingly works on their sex appeal there is a sequence where they re both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies the only real debit is that allen still seems unsure on how to shot london he s not as off as he was on match point though maybe he ll just get better as he goes along worth seeing i give it an 
the film largely focuses on a bullying robert taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to put up with him set amidst a hunt for dwindling numbers of buffalo it portrays the end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter and is full of drama and remorse for both the buffalo and the native americans taylor is blinded by his hatred of indians and his naivete that the buffalo herds will never disappear in one scene he shoots animal after animal while in another he murders indians and then eats the food they had cooking on their fire under this ruthless exterior lies an insecure person who is reduced to begging his comrades stewart granger lloyd nolan and russ tamblyn not to leave him it s not the most pleasant of films and is weighed down by the drama it creates leading to a dismal and very fitting conclusion in a blizzard 
scoop out of woody allen is definitely not my favorite director but i enjoyed match point it was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star woody allen it did have the beautiful scarlett johansson in it scoop is woody allen s latest film and though he appears in this one it s ok it also features scarlett johansson and the two of them work perfect together johansson plays sondra pransky a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of joe strombel ian mcshane joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the reaper has taken one of those souls is the secretary of peter lyman hugh jackman she tells joe that peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of england joe with the scoop of a life time travels back to the living and gives this info to sondra during a magic act sondra is at some magic show with magician sid waterman woody allen she becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box she gets the visit from joe not knowing what to do she enlists the help of sid waterman to help her crack the case this film has a nice light hearted feel to it compared to match point and yet it all works johansson and allen work great together allen s humor fits perfect for this story and role hugh jackman is terrific as peter layman the suspected serial killer this is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch the cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching woody allen be himself i say give it a chance because you just might like it 
coming immediately on the heels of match point a fine if somewhat self repetitive piece of serious woody scoop gives new hope to allen s small but die hard band of followers among whom i number myself that the master has once again found his form a string of disappointing efforts culminating in the dreary melinda and melinda and the embarrassing anything else raised serious doubts that another first rate woody comedy with or without his own participation as an actor was in the cards happily the cards turn out to be a tarot deck that serves as scoop s clever maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of woody allen comedy even more encouraging woody s self casting sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years is here an inspired bit of self parody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters in scoop allen astutely assigns himself the role of sid waterman an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stage patter who much like woody himself has brought his act to london where audiences if not more receptive are at least more polite like chaplin s calvero in limelight sid waterman affords allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative moreover because they seem in character allen s ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time waterman s character also functions neatly in the plot his fake magic body dissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from joe strombel ian mcshane a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim introduced on a river styx ferryboat to hades strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just can t rest in eternity without communicating one last scoop about the identity of the notorious tarot killer unfortunately his initial return from the dead leads him to waterman s magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate sondra pransky scarlett johansson who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magician s climactic trick sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father as demonstrated in lost in translation johansson has a talent for comedy and the querulous by play between her and allen is very amusing and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romance scoop s serial killer plot involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect peter lyman hugh jackman is the no doubt predictable result of allen s lengthy sabbatical exposure to london s ubiquitous jack the ripper landmarks and lore yet other facets of scoop as of match point also derive from woody s late life encounter with english culture its class structure manners idiom dress architecture and yes peculiar driving habits give woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire when for instance sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with peter lyman at a ritzy private club waterman observes from his point of view we re scum a good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved british social manners encountering waterman s insistent borscht belt jewish plebeianism and then of course there is waterman s hilarious exit in a smart car he can t remember to drive on the left side of the road as usual allen s humor in scoop includes heavy doses of in jokes taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as increasingly references to his own filmography in addition to the pervasive jack the ripper references for instance the film s soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of grieg s the hall of the mountain king compulsively whistled by hans beckert in m the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre the post funeral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed joe strombel clearly mimics the opening of broadway danny rose references to deconstructing harry include the use of death as a character along with his peculiar voice and costume the use of mandelbaum as a character name and the mention of adair university harry s alma mater and where sondra is now a student moreover the systematic use of greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to hades recalls the use of greek gods and a chorus in mighty aphrodite as to quotable gags allen s scripts rely less on one liners than they did earlier in his career but scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones to a question about his religion waterman answers i was born in the hebrew persuasion but later i converted to narcissism and sondra snaps off this put down of waterman s wannabe crime detecting if we put our heads together you ll hear a hollow noise all in all scoop is by far woody allen s most satisfying comedy in a decade 
first of all let me comment that the audience loved it from the first moment perhaps current events in the middle east led people to take the attitude i came for a comedy and by george i m going to enjoy it but for whatever reason everybody seemed really into the comedy of it the last few times woody has tried to do a straight comedy small time crooks curse of the jade scorpion hollywood ending i ve felt like the one liners felt strained and a bit antiquated i remember thinking at one point that would have been funny in the early sixties so going in to this movie i was afraid woody was becoming tone deaf however in this one his comic sensibilities were in perfect tune admittedly there were plenty of my fellow aarp card carrying folks in the screening but there were also plenty of somethings and somethings as well and they all seemed to get it and give up the occasional belly laugh in addition to numerous guffaws chuckles and the like in many instances the throw aways had people laughing so loud you missed the next line thematically woody was traipsing familiar ground as i suspected from the trailer this film had a lot of manhattan murder mystery in it but then again there was more than a smidgen of oedipus wrecks new york stories alice and even a little tribute to broadway danny rose at the very beginning even with woody in the movie scarlett as sondra was at times the woody proxy but her character was far from the nebbish that say will ferrell gave us in melinda and melinda or kenneth branaugh attempted in celebrity instead of archetypal ticks and quirks sondra s nerdishness comes directly from the family history which she shares early on on numerous occasions the family business leads her to malapropisms that we get as an audience while the characters on the screen can only perceive them as strange non sequiturs since we are all in on the joke we can t help but laugh but the laughs don t come from recognizing the woody nebbish but truly from the character to a great extent unlike farrell branaugh cusack or even mia farrow before her scarlett is not required to use the woody voice to evoke the woody role thus we don t find ourselves ripped out of the narrative as a woody s voice suddenly emerges from someone else face as my friend commented on the way out sid the character played by woody is a supporting role but more center stage than i was hoping going in however this time woody seems to have written a character that truly fits his current persona unlike his ed dobel sage character in anything else or his blind director in hollywood ending this time the character is a comfortable fit perhaps more importantly this time the character works in the story within the elevated circles they find themselves in he is even more fish out of water than scarlett which is used to great comedic effect throughout sid is a declining itinerant magician playing to small audiences but the fact that he is from another era is placed front and center for our enjoyment but what about jackman what about ian swearengen mcshane i liked both of them to the extent that they are used in the piece i particularly liked mcshane s short but effective turns jackman is charming with the ease of old money that was so often portrayed in films from years ago class echoes from purple rose of cairo so what did i think short answer maybe his best straight comedy since s bullets over broadway less stylized than mighty aphrodite less caustic than deconstructing harry less forced than small time crooks or hollywood ending woody has finally found a comic voice that works in the st century 
greetings again from the darkness remember all the what happened to woody allen jokes even mr allen poked fun at the fans who wanted him to continue making his same funny films as with any great artist mr allen s craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans while picking up others last year s masterpiece matchpoint showed he is still every bit as relevant and poignant as he was in the days of annie hall and manhattan what is most striking to us plus year fans is that mr new york himself seems to have a bit of a crush on the mother country apparently he actually likes england while filming matchpoint mr allen became enamored with scarlett johansson and her real life spirit and sense of humor this attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years scarlett while risking overexposure must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light she is unafraid to look and act like a real person in scoop she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and in many scenes delivers the real punchline to mr allen s straight man of course any time mr allen decides to put himself in front of the camera he will get more than his share of one liners and social commentaries in which is fine because few do it better very nice support work from ian mcshane and hugh jackman in fact mr jackman provides a few glimpses into why many of us thought him the best choice to replace brosnan as the new bond as with most of allen s films the star is the script not the actors although scarlett delivers superbly here and is a nice contrast to the polished allen and jackman what makes this one crackle is the dialogue especially the banter between allen and scarlett if you are not a huge woody the actor fan fear not he does limit his screen time and he is quite effective except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place another woodman tradition is a sparkling musical background and scoop is no exception especially the strauss composition scoop is a nice cross between annie hall and the best of the marx brothers films or the cary grant comedies yes it is an adult comedy but it is actually very cute especially for a serial killer and talking ghost comedy 
 scoop is also the name of a late thirties evelyn waugh novel and woody allen s new movie though set today has a nostalgic charm and simplicity it hasn t the depth of characterization intense performances suspense or shocking final frisson of allen s penultimate effort match point argued by many including this reviewer to be a strong return to form but scoop does closely resemble allen s last outing in its focus on english aristocrats posh london flats murder and detection this time woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian a magician called sid waterman stage moniker the great splendini who counters some snobs probing with i used to be of the hebrew persuasion but as i got older i converted to narcissism following a revelation in the midst of splendini s standard dematerializing act with scarlett johansson as sondra pransky the audience volunteer the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace english journalist s post mortem attempt to score one last top news story on the edge of the styx joe strombel ian mcshane has just met the shade of one lord lyman s son s secretary who says she was poisoned and she s told him the charming aristocratic bounder son peter lyman hugh jackman was the tarot card murderer a london serial killer sondra and sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths with sid s deadpan wit and sondra s bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the london aristocracy woody isn t pawing his young heroine muse as in match point johansson again as in the past this time moreover scarlett s not an ambitious sexpot and would be movie star she s morphed surprisingly into a klutzy bespectacled but still pretty coed sid and sondra have no flirtation which is a great relief they simply team up more or less politely to carry out strombel s wishes by befriending lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt with only minimal protests sid consents to appear as sondra s dad sondra who s captivated peter by pretending to drown in his club pool re christens herself jade spence mr spence i e woody keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker spewing non stop one liners and all the while maintaining apparently with success that he s in oil and precious metals just as jade has told him to say that s about all there is to it or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome at first allen s decision to make johansson a gauche naively plainspoken and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all around bad decision but johansson who has pluck and panache as an actress miraculously manages to carry it off helped by jackman an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable if he desires her the film actually creates a sense of relationships to make up for it limited range of characters sid and sondra spar in a friendly way and peter and sondra have a believable attraction even though it s artificial and tainted she is after all going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac what palls a bit is allen s again drooling over english wealth and class things his brooklyn background seems to have left him despite all his celebrity with a irresistible hankering for jackman is an impressive fellow glamorous and dashing his parents were english but could this athletic musical comedy star raised in australia x man s wolverine really pass as an aristocrat only in the movies perhaps here and in kate and leopold this isn t as strong a film as match point but to say it s a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong it has no more depth than a half hour radio drama or a tv show but woody s jokes are far funnier and more original than you ll get in any such media affair and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness it doesn t matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it s diverting summer entertainment on a hot day you don t want a heavy meal the whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment without crude jokes or bombastic effects without vince vaughan or owen wilson critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the allen decline that preceded match point don t believe them he doesn t try too hard why should he he may be but verbally he s still light on his feet and his body moves pretty fast too 
i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love this was the most i d laughed at one of woody s comedies in years dare i say a decade while i ve never been impressed with scarlet johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends 
i was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of scoop last night full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause i didn t speak to anyone who disliked scoop although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film they were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves scoop is a quickly paced murder mystery a young female journalism student is unwittingly maneuvered by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose plenty of hijinks ensue as she partners up with a traveling illusionist and falls in love with a frisky and charming young nobleman scoop isn t a bad addition to the woody allen filmography it isn t his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp i d say it fits quite comfortably into being an average woody allen film right in the middle of the pack if you re a woody allen fan you ll probably enjoy yourself if you re indifferent to his work then scoop might be enough to get you interested in seeing more i don t think that anyone who dislikes his style of film making and acting are going to change their mind woody plays the same kind of neurotic character we ve grown so accustomed to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film while potentially aggravating for some who might find themselves wishing he d hurry up and just spit out the words woody allen fans know what to expect very good performances all around in my opinion although i found myself missing ian mcshane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough hugh jackman is great as the charming nobleman and i think woody allen has found a new regular star to work with in scarlett johansson i think that with match point this is their second pairing and she s just magic with the material that woody gives her could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship i m glad i saw the movie and definitely recommend it more sophisticated comedy than movies like scary movie so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former scoop probably isn t for you if on the other hand you like a touch of class sophistication and fun scoop is for you probably not the woody allen film i d introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try 
reading a wide variety of scoop reviews over the past few days i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody happily i couldn t have been more wrong granted woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two but woody the writer director is in fine form and found a credible way to integrate his year old self into the story judging from the laughter and guffaws the audience ate up allen s one liners and dialogue in a way that i haven t seen in several years in a movie landscape dominated by software approved story arcs twentysomething tastes and assembly line formula fare for kiddies it s a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still rewarding path 
i don t know if this is a sitcom or not but i agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever it s great that this show still airs and i love michelle it s cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked and she sometimes said something funny aw this show can relate to children and teens and well families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family i don t know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone i love the episode when i think her name is dd the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt and she learned a lesson about stealing that was a great episode an example that this tv show shows the family working things out as a family i recommend this show for everyone 
i loved this show growing up and i still watch the first season dvd at age today what can i say i grew up in a house much like the one on full house i had a dad two sisters and a dog i guess the only difference was that i did not live with my uncle and my dad s best friend also i grew up with my mom in the house i don t know what i would have done without full house on television i think that stephanie played by jodie sweetin d j played by kirk cameron s sister candace and michelle played by mary kate and ashley olsen are my favorite characters i can relate to each of them because i am the middle child of my family like steph i am a younger sister like michelle and i am an older sister like d j i really like how the show always has moral values because i don t really like any of the o c like shows today i like the comedy of full house too uncle jesse john stamos joey dave coulier and danny bob saget are hilarious as the girls uncle dad s friend and dad respectively the story goes that after the girls mom dies danny s best friend joey and his brother in law jesse move in to help raise the kids three men trying to raise three young girls hilarious each character on full house is full of heart funny and genuinely believable joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid s heart and soul jesse is the cool motorcycle riding tough guy uncle who is softened by his three nieces and later his wife becky laurie laughlin from summerville both kids and adults will love this show guaranteed 
i had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer the end result was just two scenes in the movie the location was sylvan lake in the black hills bring the wagon stop the wagon etc so this dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed the local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real yes doris animals were hurt during filming i think the ending was copied by jack nicholson in the shining a great western social comment from the s this should be in the same class as high noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like blackboard jungle or rebel without a cause was for s youth 
full house came to me when i was about i remember seeing re runs of america s funniest home videos with bob saget and one day my mom told me that he was also in a show called full house one day i was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting family it didn t seem too interesting at first but as i watched more and more ever night at i would just be so into it this show really makes you want to be there yourself hang out with the girls go places with them and maybe even join in their little family sing alongs the thing i like most about full house is that it s a great show for kids and adults of all ages there will be some parts that are more for adults then parts that are meant for kids so that the whole family will enjoy it no matter how cheesy it can be it s still a great show and i would definitely recommend it to anyone 
i think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated when a person comes to watch a tv show what does he look out for it is to enjoy that he watches a show unless he she is a critic or a person who analyzes story but most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy full house is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office school it makes you laugh and it is not just humor yes the tanner family is a perfect family a perfectly hypothetical family if any such family existed in real world it would be a role model for us to follow but this is a tv show and not a real family and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television the very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it whatever be the comments later on another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it but would take back a message however childish that message be those jesse s talks with michelle are extremely touching if one doesn t think of it as childish overall i would say after watching every show of full house there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows 
this show is about three little girls d j stephanie and michelle their mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father danny invites his brother in law jesse and his old friend joey so the whole show is about living life the girls go through life s troubles and have life lessons they develop crushes boyfriends and many more the whole show is basically about to go with the flow you do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go i think this show is really good and fun to watch i grew up watching this show and still watch it today i am glad they still air this show on television i watch it almost every day i rate it 
i try to watch it everyday most of the time and even though i have watched it for the past years i have not seen every episode the show is about danny tanner who is guy who does news for sports his wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asks jesse an elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession of his hair joey an adult kid who does comedy and does voices of cartoons all the time to take care of his three girls donna joe they call her d j stephinie who is the second oldest and michelle the youngest they all live under one roof with no one to help them out later in the show jesse gets a girl friend and later is married to her and have twins nicki and alex this starts to happen in the new seasons this show is awesome if you like the suite life of zack and cody that s so raven boy meets world and designing woman you will love this it starts to get better in the ending seasons watch it you will love it 
i have never seen a show as good as full house full house puts all of the newer shows to shame big time anyone who has never seen it which i don t see how it is possible should see it it is a great show for anyone of any age full house will make you laugh it will make you cry it will amaze you true some people feel that there are some cheesy aspects to the show but the positive aspects out weigh all of the cheesy aspects full house ran it s first episode on september entitled our very first show and ran it s last episode on may entitled michelle rides again part ii the plot of the show is very believable danny tanner bob saget losses his wife pam in an accident involving a drunk driver danny has his brother in law jesse katsopolis john stamos which is pam s younger brother and danny also brings in his best friend joey gladstone dave coulier to help him raise his three daughters danny s daughters are named dj candice cameron bure stephanie jodie sweetin and michelle mary kate and ashley olsen joey and jesse plan on moving in with danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years which is the number of years the show ran for the following is a short description of some of the characters and the actor actress who played him her john stamos jesse john stamos is a great actor he plays jesse jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break in full house john stamos does a great job portraying his character he looked and played music like his idol elvis presley bob saget danny bob saget is also a great actor he looses his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver he has to raise three girls without a having the girl s mother bob saget does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls dave coulier joey one word can describe dave coulier funny he is great playing the character of joey was perfect for him he does a great job playing the stand up comedian waiting for his big break candice cameron bure dj she is a tremendous actress she plays the oldest sister dj which is short for donna jo she is one of the best actresses i have ever seen her acting ability in full house was very believable jodie sweetin stephanie two simple words can describe jodie sweetin incredibly amazing i wish i could say every thing that i would like to say about jodie but i would use up the word maximum just on her she got her start in a kids show called mother goose stories and when she came to full house she blew the audience s and creator s mind her great looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success that it was according to dave coulier jodie was supposed to be the star of the show it was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break jodie at five years old when the show first aired could hit every line perfectly she showed great enthusiasm most young kids can t do this as you can probably guess jodie sweetin stephanie is my favorite character in full house mary kate and ashley olsen michelle great actress full house is where they got their start they received the part of michelle because they were the only babies who did not cry while in front of a camera there are many more cast members that should be recognized these are the original characters from when the show first went on the air in the only negative thing that i can say is how full house became the michelle show towards the end i think it was to focused on her towards the end especially when i think jodie and candice were much better at acting full house is a great show for everyone it can teach you a lot one of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy such as loosing a family member occurs full house continues to attract new fans with all this said there is only a couple things left to say full house will never die and thank you the cast of full house for giving everyone a show that they can enjoy 
like most other reviewers i have first seen this movie on tv never on the big screen when i was a teenager my dad has always regarded this film highly and recommended it to me then and i must say he was not only right but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than decades since i saw it first time i have seen it two or three more times since then just a few days ago i gave it another watch and it has not lost anything of its impact with time it still a great and well worth to be seen movie manr regard peckinpah s ride the high country as one of the first and best later western which had a realistic look at life in the old west but the hardly known last hunt is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier actually it was probably decades ahead of its time or maybe it still is although thinking hard and having certainly seen s of western i like this genre i can not remember any western as bleak and depressive as this one two men bound together partly by hate partly by not seeming to have other choices surrounded by beautiful ms padget a crippled old man and a young inian leading the life of buffalo killers until fate reaches out for one of them nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem when the camera moves on and away from mr taylor a white buffalo skin comes into sight on a tree and echos from the past when all the hatred began are present again mr taylor has got his buffalo but in the end the buffalo got him aside from the top performances of everybody involved the intelligent script and the great dialogue it should also be mentioned that the last hunt is superbly photograped i have seldomely seen a western that well shot aside from the ones directed by anthony mann which are also all superbly photographed that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well and director brooks is really a superb storyteller master craftsmanship he has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every imaginable genre but even in an as prolific career as this one the last hunt still shines as one of his best if not his best definitely would deserve a higher rating compared to the something ride the high country enjoys 
ahh talespin what can i say that hasn t already been said about this great show nothing this is without a doubt one of the most well written shows i ve ever encountered live action or animation the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes and some of the mature stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for but not talespin the stories are engaging and very plausible some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you where the emphasis is on hilarity i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays at least those which aren t specifically geared toward it especially in cartoons in the episode stormy weather for instance kit cloudkicker decides that he s going to join an air circus but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous in the biggest fight of the episode baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan to which kit screams no you can t tell me what to do your re not my dad and buries his face in his pillow the next day he leaves for the air circus this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays the characters have a lot of depth to them baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book plus or minus a few degrees of laziness rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money while good in theory are seldom good in practice molly is a cute little girl but you can t let that deceive you she can be a real hellion sometimes kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest he doesn t trust adults much unless they appeal to him and he has a tendency to break off relationships watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook he looks as though he s prepared to put it right through a pirate in the end it s the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show in my book the relationship between baloo and kit is very real almost father and son this is demonstrated well in all s whale that ends whale when baloo takes kit s word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults baloo and becky s relationship is also realistic due to baloo s motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol sea duck not necessarily a desire to help rebecca but something tells me that if he did get the duck back he d still do jobs for rebecca the sea duck not to mention all the other planes in the series is pretty realistically designed the plane s functions don t change once throughout the series continuity like that is hard to come by also and unlike most other super planes of other cartoons it doesn t have one single weapon on board unless you count mangoes and relies instead on it s cunning pilot s great skill to get out of trouble it s hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn t have some sort of gun turret laser cannon or even a handgun somewhere on board and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays plus it s just such a darn cool design this is definitely the best cartoon ever period definitely worth all ten stars 
ever since i remember i have loved airplanes and flying i am now in college with a private pilot s license and looking to become a commercial i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me this was it my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid i had the theme memorized as i grew up and i can still re cite it today it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the dvd s soon it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless i cannot get enough of this show 
if you are viewing this show for the first time you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality colorful and imaginative characters entertaining dialogue plots that seem to have some depth to them even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times i mean this is a syndicated children s show right this is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as pokemon pepper ann mighty morphin power rangers and vr troopers please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese exports courtesy of the fox network and saban entertainment don t worry you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late s and early s some examples of this period would be transformers garfield and friends captain power and c o p s a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox besides these prime examples disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids coming up with a lineup called the disney afternoon aside from a dumbed down show called the gummi bears early shows like darkwing duck duck tales and chip n dale s rescue rangers gave credence to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like the little mermaid beauty and the beast the rescuers down under and the great mouse detective but above all these wonders shines talespin the premiere of plunder and lightning was a two hour thrill ride and won an emmy much to my delight the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere while i enjoy the plots and dialogue i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters there s rebecca cunningham an independent female but still fallible kit cloudkicker full of pre teen angst and optimism louie with his loyalty and support frank wildcat the most entertaining engineer since scotty on the original star trek molly cunningham cute and witty but with some depth that most child characters don t have and of course in the middle of it all there s baloo whom i would describe as a slobby version of james bond this is because whenever there s trouble baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker than most fastest of all sea duck read james bond s aston martin of course every great show has to have great villains and talespin doesn t disappoint here either from the megalomania of businesstiger shere kahn to the vain and always failing air pirate don karnage to the hilarious and inept soviet satirized thembrians the animation is good the music appropriate and the episodes are for me the finest that children s programming has ever had to offer great fun for the whole family 
brilliant kung fu scenes loads of melodrama peculiar footwear symbolism and an unhappy end makes barefoot kid an unforgettable film one of the silliest subtitles i ve seen 
i have seen this wonderful production and i wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith s wife i am not sure of her character s name i went to byu with her and lost touch with her her maiden name was kim luke and i wonder if anyone has any info on her she is not listed in the credits this production was outstanding a tear jerker on all accounts superb acting by all i guess i don t even want to put it in the general category of acting more like portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this the final dispensation something like that if anyone worked with kim or has a website or something please let me know she was fantastic in her role by the way thanks melissa thorne
this is the most compelling and excellent performance that robert taylor ever gave it even surpasses his wonderful performance as johnny eager coming a full years after that film his looks are still a wonder to see but he has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty violent role charlie gilson taylor is the last of his breed a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure his wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings is stunning to watch he is basically a lonely man needing the people around him but they dislike him because of his sociopath behavior his partner is sandy mckenzie stewart granger who is sick of the hunt and only goes along because he is a failure at anything else along the way charlie kills a family of indians and captures the beautiful debra pagent charlie tries to seduce her to no avail but sees that sandy is interested in her also granger is kind of sad to watch so fed up with the hunt longing to go away with the girl and her baby lloyd nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing russ tamblyn plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world the group is an odd mix of good and evil young and old in the end taylor gets spooked by the buffalo as many hunters before him had and runs off leaving sandy with the girl upon his return that night sandy leaves with the woman setting charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get sandy and have the girl for himself the final confrontation comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it it is taylor s film all the way and he was truly a much underrated actor of the era 
the best way for me to describe europa which is high on the list of my favourite films is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended i didn t know films could be made like that entirely original in it s visual style it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be it s as far away from the master and coverage style of shooting as one can get perfectly integrating many layers of image sound effects props dialogue voice over performance editing lighting etc all equal none predominant despite hollywood s dialogue myopia cinema is not about dialogue nor is it about beautiful lighting action or music it works best when all the elements are on an equal footing where only the blending of those elements in the order or combination in which they are presented will communicate the idea reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element and the film has no meaning europa is what cinema should strive to be 
despite reading the initial comments from someone who curiously disliked the film why is the only negative comment very first on the list it was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it obviously the church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet joseph smith in a positive manner thats the whole idea and in fact those points were extremely effective we already know joseph smith was human but despite that and all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable god given work i d recommend it to anyone 
this is one of the most spiritual movies i have ever seen i headed up with about people to st george and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the st george temple not one person had dry eyes in the audience also there were some non religious and anti mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and were touched by the captivating music and reenactment of the story of the pioneers and the hardships they faced because of their beliefs i recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to understand more about joseph and the hardships that the pioneers went through after all it is apart of american history 
i really thought they did an excellent job there was nothing wrong with it at all i don t know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible it moved me to tears i guess it moved about everyone to tears but i try not to cry in a movie because it s embarrassing but this one got me it was sooo good i hope they release it on dvd because i will definitely buy a copy i feel like it renewed my faith and gave me a hope that i can t explain it made me want to strive to be a better person they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted i guess compared to that i feel like our own trials are nothing well not nothing but they hardly match what they had to go through i loved it who played emma 
have no illusions this is a morality story granger is the troubled ex buffalo hunter tempted back to the plains one more time by kill crazed taylor granger can see the end is near and feels deeply for the cost of the hunt on the herds the indians and the land itself taylor on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo or indians to being with a woman while granger s role of the tortured hunter is superb it s taylor who steals the show as the demented immoral everyman out for the fast buck and the goodtimes there s not a lot of bang bang here but the story moves along quickly and we are treated to a fine character performance by nolan the theme of this story is just as poignant today as in the s man s relationship to the land and what s on it and racism considering when this was made the censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the bawdy house taylor s relationship with the squaw and much of the dialogue although downbeat this is truly a great western picture 
warning mild spoilers the story of joseph smith stands out as an amazing even moving episode in american history and world religious history this movie portrays events in the life of joseph smith whom mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true church of jesus christ on the earth i ve so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing joseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers alvin hyrum joseph who at a very young age needed an operation the operation done without our modern conveniences was bloody and difficult the scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between joseph and his parents joseph s religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what mormons call the first vision was interestingly portrayed the face of jesus is never shown but you see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands the rejection by religious leaders and many in his small new york community is sweetened at least slightly by joseph s marriage to emma this movie does not clearly map out the events of mormon church history but merely jumps from scene to scene this is not a critique simply a note about the style the practice of tarring and feathering is shown and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a sermon about the savior s love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked the movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of mormonism as an infant church while at the same time the ever deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments the film shows many scenes from joseph s life including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of joseph s life including his fierce love for his wife his endless love for children his wit his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition his religious sentiments and his compassion as joseph and hyrum ride to carthage never to return home alive most of the characters from throughout the movie whose lives had been touched by joseph are shown along the way helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful at the end the martyrdom of joseph and hyrum is portrayed and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed when i first watched the movie i assumed it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to non members i no longer think that is the case although i hope the movie can do just that as an insider i find that the film is a celebration of joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him i am curious to see how outsiders will view the film whether they will simply see it as propagandic an epic story of an american religious man or something else the film is beautifully shot family friendly moving and hopefully something good for everyone that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture including freedom of religious expression and respect generally for the law we moderns take for granted 
i am stunned at the negative comments that i have read and can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest this is the most moving and real portrayal of joseph smith that i have ever seen it was well acted to the point that at times i forgot that i was watching a movie it brought joseph s life of hardship good natured optimism enduring faith in people and god and ultimate sacrifice to life such in a way that frankly left me speechless and silent in awe if anyone of any christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive way i would have to say it is a reflection of the individual and not the movie i give the movie a and encourage honest souls to view it at the very least it is an extremely heart felt portrayal of man who gave everything he had for what he believed in a world where values and beliefs are ridiculed this movie stands as a enduring reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be no matter what religious beliefs we hold ann pruitt 
this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie the story was accurately portrayed the story starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her father traveling by steamboat to nauvoo illinois she has become a member of the lds church and he has not he thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging she encourages him to read about joseph smith the prophet this is where the story of the prophet joseph smith begins the movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the lds church at the same time it was graphic at times but was needed the emotional expression was very believable which caused my emotions to spill out filming was awesome the way in which the story was presented was touching after the movie was over we just sat there unable to moved i was stunned for people who know very little of joseph smith the mormon prophet i would encourage you to see this if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life for those who are members of the church i would encourage you to see it it will increase your testimony of this most incredible man this is a must see 
thought at first this film would be your typical western film however it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the very end which turned out very unusual charlton heston sam burgade midway had past experiences with james coburn zach provo deadfall and zach never forgave sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back unfortunately barbara hershey susan burgade the portrait of a lady managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone sam burgade had to make some very hard decisions and and i was quite surprised at the conclusion this is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding 
 the last hard men is a typical western for the s most of them seem to be inspired by sam peckinpah also this one but director andrew mclaglan is a john ford pupil and this can be obviously shown in many scenes imo the beginning is very good in a certain way mclaglan wanted to show the audience a travel from the civilization to the wilderness in the third part there are some illogical flaws and i complain a bit about charlton heston he has to play an old ex lawman named sam burgade but he is in a fantastic physical shape i never got the feeling that he really has problems to climb on a horse or on a rock for me he didn t looks very motivated as he usual do in most of his epic movies same goes to the beautiful barbara hershey who is playing the sheriff s daughter maybe both had troubles with the director or were unhappy with their roles hershey and coburn are not showing their best but they are still good if the scriptwriter had john wayne in their mind as sam burgade also michael parks as modern sheriff is a bit underused in his role on the other hand there is james coburn as outlaw zach provo coburn is a really great villain in this one he is portraying the bad guy between maniac hate and cleverness his role and his acting is the best of the movie landscapes and shootouts are terrific the shootings scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic zach provo and his gang had some gory and violent scenes what i miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie i would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar overall it s an entertaining western flick not a great movie but above the average because of a great coburn a very good beginning and some gory and violent scenes 
the arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the s and their conflict with the native american residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo the commercial killers however weren t the only ones shooting bison train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches there were even buffalo killing contests buffalo bill cody killed thousands of buffalo some u s government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds the buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once great bison herds the last hunt holds one of robert taylor s most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept taylor as a heavy guy his characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter who kills only for pleasure had its potential the will to do harm to another when he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker stewart granger it is evident that these two contrasted characters with opposite ideas will clash violently very soon taylor s shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts he also enjoy killing indians who steal his horses he even tries to romance a beautiful squaw debra paget who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort among others buffalo hunters are lloyd nolan outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner russ tamblyn as a half breed and constance ford as the dance hall girl but taylor steals the show richard brooks captures in cinemascope and technicolor distant view of buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animals the film is a terse brutish outdoor western with something to say about old western myths and a famous climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero 
a shift in outlook is neccesary to enjoy modern british films one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the criteria that american films are judged britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it but at warmth british films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor this film fails not in its content but only in attaching itself to the predeccesor so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their tethers it s a couple of decades later gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind he teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses when students he s fired up find abuses in their midst he must face whether he s just all talk this is a subversive film in that there s not the usual worldly character of any american movie that you expect to do whatever he does but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles maybe it s certainly no protest by numbers though being too warm where u s film may seem realistic because they re urban and gritty this and other british films of recent years those that don t try to match america for visceral thrills are real because british humour reveals truths 
i have to say that this tv movie was the work that really showed how talented melissa joan hart is we are so used to now seeing her in a sitcom and i really hope that a tv station will show this tv movie again soon as it will show the sabrina fans that mjh shines in a drama seen as we have watched her on sabrina now for now years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much unused talent would be a plus melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents done away with so she can be with the guy she loves one thing that all sabrina viewers will notice melissa works with david lascher in this well before he took the role of josh on sabrina so it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again hopefully mjh gets some good roles in movies or even in more tv movies sort of like kellie martin who has always shined in tv movies lots of unused talent waiting to bust out when it comes to melissa joan hart you shine always melissa 
i really enjoyed this documentary about kenny and spencer s attempt to pitch the dawn was a great look at how outsiders try to get to the inside to make it big the story was put together well and organized in an interesting manner that made the film flow well certainly worth a watch my only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure perhaps that is part of the point we expect it but in reality that is not what happened or usually happens the film is also a great way to see the personality of kenny and spencer outside of their canadian television show you can see a bit of what is yet to come i look forward to a chance to see the papal chase 
hi im scott a k a woody i love the film twisted desire and i love watching melissa joan hart on the t v as i think she is fine i am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too so this helped my watch it don t ask i love the way that nicole plans out her parents murder very carfully as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles so she wont give away her fingerprints a very well planned out idea back i guess it all backfired on nicole as she got caught as her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt i give this film a nine out of ten and put it in my top films list and last but not least if anyone see s this film in the shops please tell me as i seen it on tv and didn t record it bye
when i was flicking through the tv guide and came across twisted desire on the movie section i read it s description three words caught my eye melissa joan hart i find her role in sabrina the teenage witch absolutely vile i hate those kind of programs so i was just thinking that it was going to be a boring old love story starring her little did i know it finally started on the television i had my bucket ready in case i were to puke over it s cheesiness or soppiness you know what i mean at first you think she s just a nice ordinary girl who s in love but has mean parents then when you find out she s manipulated her boyfriend into killing her parents so she could be with her true love you re like whoa you just don t expect this sort of role for that sort of actress she played her role very well in my opinion i never expected her to be able to act like such a bitch and voil she did it perfectly congrats to her the movie was very good i d definitely watch it again and recommend it to others 
twisted desire was a tv movie starring melissa joan hart melissa s character jennifer stanton a seventeen year old seduces her current boyfriend nick ryan into murdering her two parents the movie is based on the murders of the parents of year old jessica wiseman jessica had her year old boyfriend douglas christopher thomas shoot and kill her parents thomas was executed in jessica was released from prison when she turned years old evidence now suggests that it was jessica who fired the fatal shot that killed her mother jessica is known to now be residing somewhere in the state of virginia 
i recently stumbled across this film on tnt five minutes into it while on vacation in florida hey there has to be some down time in the hotel right i was initially surprised to see melissa joan hart in any feature length film on tnt i mean drive me crazy isn t that old already is it but i stuck with it and was thoroughly surprised and entertained melissa plays her role as the psychotic jennifer excellently the supporting cast nick the ex con boyfriend karen her best friend and her life controlling parents all added a great degree of believability the twist at the end was a nice closure to this tale of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everybody if you get a chance check it out 
an hilariously accurate caricature of trying to sell a script documentary hits all the beats plot points character arcs seductions moments of elation and disappointments and the allure but insane prospect of selling a script or getting an agent in hollywood and all the fleeting fantasy realizing but ultimately empty rites of passage attendant to being socialized into the system hotz and rice capture the moment of thinking you re finally a player only to find that what goes up comes down fast and in a blind siding fashion that for inexplicable reasons hollywood has moved on and left you checking your heart your dreams and your pockets pitch is a must see for students in film school to taste the mind and ego bashing gantlet that is for most the road that must be traveled to sell oneself and one s projects in hollywood if your teacher or guru has never been there they can t tell you what you need to prepare for this gantlet to enter the biz talent is necessary but far from sufficient
a young solicitor from london arthur kidd is sent to a small coastal town of crythin gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow mrs drablow while attending her funeral a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention supposedly drablow lived a reclusive life and locals kept pretty quiet about her after this he heads to mrs drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide there he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes now can mrs drablow s belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and i can see their point but only in doses does it draw upon tag yes from what you can gather i was left a little under whelmed despite really liking it i was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature but that s probably it expecting mainly i had a similar reaction with the haunted house thriller the changeling when you hear so many good things it s sometimes hard not get caught up with it anyhow what the british tv presentation of the woman in black effectively does is bring out a truly old fashion slow burn spine tingling premise driven by its moody locations disquieting atmosphere and first rate performances subtly blankets the psychologically gripping story adapted off susan hill s novel of the same name as the simple mystery authentically opens up with a depressingly tragic tone and successfully characterises its protagonist little seems to happen and can feel drawn out but the fragile randomness of it catch you off guard whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black who mostly appears as a background figure it s ultimately creepy she might not appear all that much but when she does talk about unnerving that also goes for that downbeat conclusion pauline moran who plays the woman in black competently gets us nervous by just her gaunt appearance and sudden positioning a pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you she s a spirit you don t want to cross paths with yet alone let her see you an accomplished performance by a marvelously moody adrian rawlins as the solicitor arthur kidd does hold it all together in support are solid turns by bernard hepton david daker clare holman and david ryall drawing heavy on its lushly sombre rural town and foggy coastal locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the forlorn time worn victorian house that comprehensively suffocates the air with constant fear director herbert wise carefully fabricates alarming imagery that slowly covers one secretive piece at a time in a smoothly paved out rhythm of well judged contriving instead of going out to shock us some scenes contain a distressing intensity that won t let go the sound effects are masterfully used by surrounding and disorienting the air rachel portman s harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you this rarity made for television feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural spook fest it might not share much new to the sub genre but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse 
this is a plain old spooky ghost story i showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club and they were kept spellbound until the ending no blood or gore just good old fashioned suspense it starts out right from the beginning and builds and builds the ending is a real twist that caught me unawares well directed and well acted it is also a period piece set in the s which added to the atmosphere i was so impressed i got the book by susan hill from amazon the movie follows the book rather closely it s a shame it s not readily available on dvd my copy is vhs this along with haunted are probably two of the best ghost stories i ve ever scene which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes in your face gore any day 
i first watched this film when i was a kid and is the only time in my life that i can remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in utter horror at one particular scene i remembered it again with a disscusion with my uni friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of hesitation i might add to my surprise i only found it on the web in the states when it was made in england when i watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too this is in my opinon the scariest film ever made hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit pony and trap crap pardon the pun what is amazing though is the power of this film and at uni when watching this with about twenty of my associates i have never heard so many screams blokes as well even the sight of the video brings the fear of god into me of that one particular scene and left me feeling that i will never walk alone again in the dark 
there is nothing remotely scary about modern horror which is an insult to the word horror freddie vs jason the scream movies cabin trash and especially stephen king s infantile attempts he s recycled every story from the monkey s paw to whatever often in the same story at horror in both writing and on film except for kubrick s version of the shining which actually was scary unlike king s books which are as frightening as my big toe the left one which still has the nail but the woman in black is that rare modern film that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end this is the way it should be done the director creates tension and the scariest ghost ever actually seen simply by having her suddenly turn up standing still somewhere or other with that incredible look on her face then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close he s learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror val lewton original cat people and robert wise a val lewton disciple and director of the haunting and the body snatcher jacques tournier another val lewton disciple who directed a truly horrifying zombie film not the gross rubbish raimi did gross isn t scary folks it s just gross and lewis allen the uninvited and of course jack clayton s turn on henry james the innocents and the way the master of suspense hitchcock can still bring you to the edge of your seat even with a slow building and burning period piece like under capricorn ten stars

this film gave me nightmares for months and i m this is the scariest movie ever made that is no exaggeration i saw this movie at school in english lessons and no one else was scared which amazed me after reading other reviews i m glad i m not the only person who found this so scary 
i was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype i was surprised at the resilience of the ghost s image in my mind the next day and the day after that i ve watched it times and each time i appreciate it even more the settings are gorgeous the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects the marsh long shots and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss the main hero is so likable and good natured that he is easily sympathized with to the person who complained that there wasn t enough spark in this film i d say that it s because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person it is a fairly slow paced film with an unusual amount of time being spent pre and post ghost attack on developing his character with family and work life spoilers discussion i especially liked the turning point when he comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost he describes the woman in black and then at the end of the conversation he says that he is going back because after all what harm had she done to him the other man says you can t go back alone and lends the hero his dog the cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief with it s bounding through the house and even into the locked room the many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out the woman shows up in mid shot at the church showing that it is not afraid of the church and is also not shy or bound to the house this is all in the very beginning another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence watching the funeral as the camera pans to the right the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones the older man won t even look at it but the kids are all yelling and taunting it crreeepy usually ghosts are hidden in shadows haunting specific locales or people as has been mentioned the ghost s malevolence and wrath are frightening and i feel it s attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified the ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house or perhaps he was marked no matter what by saving the gypsy girl the guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable and really fills the role well i have been spreading the word to my friends about how much i enjoyed this film and it is reassuring to see others feel the same i can see how people don t quite see the same masterpiece especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype i think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether or not ghosts could physically harm man whew i plan to watch it again tonight followed by the changeling aaww yeah any other films to recommend thanks 
spectacular horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it the atmosphere is very creepy and stylish the score is chilling but the best about the movie is it s performances it s rare to get scared by performances and this movie s solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor the story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes though the woman in black does not have much screen time she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes the dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and that s when it becomes really scary if you have the chance watch this on theater it s a totally different experience but as scary as this movie this is one of the best ghost movies ever and it s directed for people that want to get scared 
this film is exactly what its title describes an attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offer first it s kinda fun to see the style toronto i remember with all its silly haircuts sunglasses clothes and attitude it really hasn t changed any just a nice safe cheap provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types it s also amusing to see kenny and spenny head to l a and find out that it s toronto all over again only with a strange assortment of beach bums musicians fortune tellers and yet more uppity film types i don t see pitch as a film to be enjoyed it s not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone s aspirations being trampled i take pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio execs and production houses would be and successful writers musicians and actors are still mere transients even when they reach the big time so kenny and spenny are trying to sell you a warning buy it or don t but the message is still there 
every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror diamonds are crafted and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance this is no less than a diamond this is a film brimful of eeriness chilling anticipation and dark atmosphere and i think it s safe to say one of my favourite horror films of all time and of course it contains probably the single most flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror every time i see the film and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen i try to remember exactly when i will be frightened out of my wits but it never fails to happen i never get it right and i find myself as terrorized as the first time i saw it now it must be said to scare a jaded horror fan like that that is nothing short of pure perfection unlike the americans the brits know their subtleties they take pride in the art of acting they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere they rely on the power of the potent story and the creepiness in this case of suggestion and anticipation every single element is impeccable from the set pieces the acting the story to the menacing atmosphere pauline moran surely could make the devil whimper that s for sure as an end note if you for some demented reason don t like this piece of insanity then you honestly don t know what horror is all about and frankly do not deserve to know it either thank you 
yes it s flawed especially if you re into hollywood films that demand a lot of effects a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot and you can t actually think for yourself roeg s films are for the intelligent film goer and insignificance is a perfect example the characterizations are brilliant the story is excellent but like all nic roeg s films it has you thinking on every level about aspects of reality that would never have dawned on you before his films always make you think and personally i like that in a film so don t expect to come away from watching this film and feeling all happy happy because it s likely you ll be disappointed but i think it s excellent 
this movie is great the music with the exception of the very first song in the movie was awesome the story line is awesome too it s just basically a wonderfull movie for all ages i found the last battle scene awesome basically this was a great flick 
a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear also alas an ending that comes out of nowhere because apparently the auteur has lost interest in the movie or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot 
nina foch insists that my name is julia ross in this film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready it s short and because it is the film suffers it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer when i was growing up foch was a fixture on television playing a neurotic woman the wife with the cheating husband the nervous wreck she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles here she s a pretty young ingenue playing the title role julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs hughes and her son ralph little does she know though we learn immediately that the employment agent is a front set up to get just the right woman for this assignment a woman with no family and no boyfriend it s a live in situation once julia gets to the house she s drugged and when she wakes up she s told she s mrs hughes and not allowed to leave the acting is very good low budget but still entertaining some things particularly at the end happen way too quickly which is why i said the movie is too short nevertheless i recommend it 
this was a typical grade b movie in s hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations why it has a wonderful plot and backed up by nina foch george macready and dame may witty as a female villain of all people when a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary she certainly gets more than she bargained for the only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise seems that witty and macready want to pass her off as their daughter in law and wife respectively macready killed his real wife and wants to do foch in as well so that a body can be claimed the film deals with how foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does why don t people believe her 
greatly enjoyed this mystery thriller film about a young woman nina foch julia ross who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work julia reads an ad in the local london newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position julia obtains the position and is hired by a mrs hughes dame may witty who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job george macready ralph hughes is the son of mrs hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery this strange family all live in a huge mansion off the cornwall coast of england and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense 
my name is julia ross is a mesmerizing b thriller from joseph h lewis arguably one of the very finest directors of hollywood noir films this minute gothic oddity from columbia pictures came after lewis lengthy apprenticeship as the helmer of a string of poverty row westerns east side kids comedies horror melodramas including the incredibly bizarre bela lugosi shocker the invisible ghost and standard studio b product secrets of a co ed bombs over burma the falcon in san francisco etc all of which set the stage rather nicely for what was to come from the enormously talented and inventive mr lewis my name is julia ross as well as so dark the night from the following year introduced a director who had mastered the rare and delicate art telling a dark and probing tale swiftly and efficiently on the most modest of budgets later lewis productions like gun crazy and the big combo despite the expanded scope of their narrative structure continued to rely upon deft lucid camera work and effective low key lighting and very modest resources my name is julia ross probably owes more to the tradition of british mysteries it s set in a studio bound england than it does to conventional film noir attitudes and trappings a young woman nina foch agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman dame mae witty two days after her arrival she awakens from a deep sleep in a completely strange house and mysteriously enough with a brand new identity that of the old woman s daughter in law told that she s been the victim of a nervous breakdown she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her predicament but before long she begins to piece together the strange and troubling truth behind this dark mystery that her husband the always menacing george macready most probably murdered his real wife and that she s been duped into participating in a harrowing and sinister scheme much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest tale are the indelible touches that lewis brings to the production marking it as the first of his truly serious endeavors as a film director 
for those who think of dame may witty as the kindly slightly batty old lady from hitchcock s the lady vanishes this movie requires an adjustment here she s anything but kindly or batty instead her son george macready is the loony one just don t give him a knife otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe now we know what he has in mind for the trapped nina foch if he can just get out from under mother s domineering hand really tight little woman in danger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout the script never strays from foch s dilemma she s held prisoner in a big old gothic house on the edge of an angry sea they re going to kill her but why her predicament makes no sense the tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another but even strangers seem against her we begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from her director joseph h lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so then too watch foch run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top witty too shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her wacko son in line my one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events nonetheless it s a good nerve wracking way to spend a little over an hour courtesy columbia studios 
nina foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little gothic nail biter she accepts a position as secretary to a london society dowager played imperiously by dame may witty and her creepy son the effete and bothersome george macready before she knows it she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor she s never seen before where witty and macready are calling her marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that she s macready s mad wife of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds and even though we know julia has to eventually escape her trap director joseph lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how she ll manage it my name is julia ross has nothing stylistically to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period but i was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe string budget and b movie pedigree there are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat and i found myself really rooting for julia as she caught on to the scheme underfoot and began to outsmart her captors in any other gothic thriller the heroine would have swooned screamed and dithered waiting for her hero to come and save her so i can t tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herself well done grade b 
a toothsome little potboiler whose minute length doesn t seem a second too short my name is julia ross harks back to an english tradition of things not being what they seem hitchcock s the lady vanishes is one example out of work julia ross nina foch finds a dream job at a new employment agency in london whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend after reporting to duty she wakes up having been drugged in a vast manderley like pile on the cornish coast supposedly as the barmy in the crumpet wife of george macready who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks his doting enabling mum is the irresistible dame may whitty this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of good vs evil than she occupied in the lady vanishes the nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically we know what s going on but are powerless to tell poor julia this movie curiously is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest and very few british films noirs i think it s closer to the gothic old dark house tradition than the american one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption it does however evince a more modern psychoanalytic cast of mind whatever you call it it remains a sharply satisfying thriller 
wonderful family drama comedy starring macclaine and garr that entertains and warms the heart every time i see it strongly recommended for all ages from year olds to grannies lovely period piece capturing the story encompasses the struggling garr her two children and aunt zena macclaine trying to make ends meet without a man as head of the household the family heads west to take the inheritance of a long forgotten relative that has left garr a run down ramshackle road side cafe right out of the late s the tenacious garr as the sweet but determined mom gets the whole family into the restoration and opening of the cafe but wait aunt zena is an old circus performer with card tricks magic powders and a jesters sense of humor she loves to get the kids and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games what happens next is a delightful combination of miracle at lords thrown together with the cuban missile crises with authentic tv news from the real event and a ghost prank that gets totally out of hand this film entertains philosophizes questions religiosity and gives an unnerving glimpse of the frightening scare of october s cuban missile crises in the end one is left with the wonder of faith family and rediscovered love oh and the music from the era of the early s is just great recommend strongly as a feel good film out 
i took a chance on hardcastle and mccormick by purchasing the first season s worth canadian release from amazon when i got it i started with the pilot and i was instantly hooked after that i rated it stars on amazon and i am rating it stars here it is just that good what i liked about it were the opening and closing themes and of course stephen j cannell s logo at the end of each episode but most of all the relationship between the judge and mark as they worked together to crack each case i was so hooked that i also purchased the second season as a companion and i enjoyed it equally if you do not have this excellent series on disc i believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection 
every kid has that movie that he pops into vhs when he has nothing to do or when there is a babysitter around this was that movie for me i can tell you the whole plot exactly i must have seen it times at least and i can say it is a good kids family movie i still have the tape i haven t watched it in years but maybe i ll get around to it this week and be a kid for the day you just have to love the care bears and their messege 
i saw this film when i was or years old alone in my parent s basement on a saturday night it was being shown on chiller theatre a regular fright feature that i watched religiously as a young un now i have seen many old horror films thanks to chiller theatre but none ever stuck with me like danse macabre a k a castle of blood i am now and only last year was i fortunate enough to locate a relatively recent quality dvd edition of this wonderfully shudder inducing supernatural classic having thought i d never manage to see it again i have already watched it four more times and cannot seem to get tired of it they just don t make spook films like this one anymore haunted catacombs and mist enshrouded graveyards just don t work as well in color as they did in black and white back in the day anyway this one has edgar allen poe and barbara steele deliciously shadowy cobweb wrap ed haunted castle sets restless spirits re enacting their deaths and a wickedly ironic ending imo this one s right up there with robert wise s the haunting the innocents with deborah kerr and the more recent the others 
i first remember seeing this one back in the s when it was shown on late night television scared the hell out of me but then i was a teenager back in those days not as jaded about films as i am now castle of blood aka danse macabre is a fine example of the s italian horror genre along with mario bava s black sunday curse of the living dead aka kill baby kill and mario caiano s nightmare castle if you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing then check these out as well i also rate these along with those early poe films that roger corman was doing during the same period i saw the new synapse dvd that was taken from a french print and it s a great improvement over that old pan and scan print that was making the rounds on television over the years it adds a couple of minutes of dialog in french that don t really add much to the movie as whole but it s nice to see it complete without cuts unfortunately the dvd doesn t really offer any extras beyond stills from the film one flub i noticed was in the opening scene seeing the smoke effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inn s front door i guess the editors didn t catch it at the time or maybe they didn t care but it is something i didn t notice the first time that s the wonders of dvd you get to see all the flubs mistakes and details that weren t apparent the first time around but no matter but no matter it still gets a on the imdb meter 
when american author edgar allan poe visits london he is approached by british journalist alan foster who becomes the target of a peculiar wager not believing poe s assertion that all of his macabre stories have been based on actual experience foster accepts a bet from poe and his friend sir thomas blackwood that he cannot spend an entire night in the blackwood s haunted castle once installed in the abandoned castle foster discovers that he is not alone as he is approached by various beautiful women and handsome men and a doctor of metaphysics who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the stories of their demises on the anniversary of their deaths the first time i watched this glorious bit of classic horror i was mesmerized the entire time i found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful babs steele is undeniably beautiful the music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing the topless scene threw me for a loop as i was not expecting it it looks as synapse did a great job with picture enhancement because this movie looks damn fine for its age and it s the uncut international version to boot this is the movie responsible for me starting a babs steele and klaus kinski collection 
i ve watched this movie a number of times and found it to be very good this movie is also known as castle of terror coffin of terror and dance macabre barbara steele is her usual beautiful creepy self george riviere the male lead does a good job with his role the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere and there is a good deal of tension throughout the camera angles are good and the acting for the most part isn t bad this film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening i have the dvd uncut version which is far superior to the edited tv version grab some popcorn turn out the lights settle back and enjoy john r tracy
i originally saw this movie as a boy at the old rialto theatre as part of a saturday afternoon matin e triple bill which also featured vincent price s last man on earth and mario bava s nightmare castle i had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards though i didn t know it then all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre no wonder i was so scared though all three films frightened me it was castle of blood that had the most profound impact it was the first on the bill i didn t even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first minutes of the movie that s lot to miss since the edited print only ran about minutes the unedited runs minutes but despite this the dark creepy atmosphere complete with ruined castles fog enshrouded cemeteries shadows and cobwebs gothic set design strong acting and suspense especially the last minutes scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression it took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection since it was a french italian import it wasn t a movie that showed up on the late show in winnipeg i couldn t quite remember the title remember i didn t get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless and to make matters worse the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles aka danze macabre coffin of terror castle of terror long night of terror etc and the usa uk working title castle of blood was very generic similar to dozens of other b horror and suspense films making it illusive but thanks to the internet and perseverance i found it at last what a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years it may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when i was a boy but as haunted house movies go it s stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as the haunting the innocents or black sunday the film is a fine early effort of italian director antonio margheriti it stars s scream queen icon barbara steele and features a well written screenplay by sergio corbucci about a sceptical writer georges riviere who on a bet spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story the hypnotic steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest as is arturo dominici as dr carmus and margarete robsahm as julia many of the tricks margheriti employs to create the film s eerie atmosphere cobwebs creaking doors fog etc are bound to seem clich to a modern audience but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour rather than using body counts and special effects the film creates scares the old fashion way relying on a good story stylish direction fine set production interesting camera work and strong acting performances margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film s suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer the film is not without faults the pace drags at the beginning of the film ironically the minutes i originally missed this is probably worsened by synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored in terms of the intro it may have been more of hindrance than a help the english voice dubs are merely passable and in the restored scenes the language shifts from english to french english subtitles provided which is sure to be annoying to some viewers however synapse films deserves kudos for the quality of the print clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so i enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of s italian goth films or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story rob rheubottom winnipeg mb canada
in an era of such awful cartoons i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies this movie does contradict the first i won t deny that however when i was in the target age group for this movie i didn t even notice nor would it have mattered if i did the people who made it may have used new generation to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began this was my favorite movie at age and it did not scare me or confuse me at all 
the dvd for danaza macabra castle of blood is very odd that s because parts of the film are in french with subtitles and the rest is dubbed into english from the french sometimes characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene when i tried to get the film to be just subtitled or just dubbed it made no difference odd but still watchable the story purports to be based on a poe story though i can t recall which one in fact the character of poe appears in the beginning and end of the film though it didn t look especially like him a rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entire night in a manner home it seems like an easy bet to win even if the house is very creepy however it can t be that easy as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet died yet this fool still wants to make the wager while in the home he meets lovely barbara steele within and falls madly for her later however he learns that she died more than a decade earlier how can this be i could tell you more about the plot but don t want to spoil any of the suspense see it for yourself to find out the rest of the story this film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere the house black white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary looking film as for the plot it s interesting especially because there are many twists and turns so many that you are wondering just who is and who isn t among the undead by the end of the film the only negative is that i felt sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed crazy as it might sound i felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessary also parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity a strikingly beautiful woman appears topless but it s hardly necessary for the plot 
i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville kentucky when i was a boy the scene where dr carmus finds the gardener s coffin and the breathing dead body therein was the scariest part of the movie for me only intensified by the darkness of the film i also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers 
this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalist poe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle well of course he can but will he come out unscathed hard to say with all these strange people that aren t supposed to be there wandering around including the icy barbara steele this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english and switches back and forth a few times perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost it s also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one doesn t see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate plus there s a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times this version on synapse is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white barbara steele definitely makes the movie too out of 
antonio margheriti s danza macabra aka castle of blood of is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of italian gothic horror and after mario bava s la maschera del demonio aka black sunday of and roger corman s pit and the pendulum of starring the great vincent price another must see that earned the wonderful barbara steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female horror icon in the history of motion pictures but not only is the beautiful and brilliant barbara steele one of my favorite actresses of all time the screenplay to danza macabra was co written by no one less than the cinematic genius sergio corbucci who directed such ingenious spaghetti western milestones as django and the great silence italy s number in the field right after mario bava director antonio margheriti is one of the all time masters of gothic horror and castle of blood is doubtlessly his greatest achievement hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece when he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories edgar allen poe in a gloomy london tavern young journalist alan foster georges rivi re accepts a bet from a nobleman that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all souls eve as soon as foster enters the eerie castle mysterious things start to happen after a little while however he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle the stunningly beautiful elisabeth blackwood barbara steele the mysterious events so far however have only been forebodings of the terrors the castle bears however the eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by riz ortolani create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison the wonderful barbara steele is fantastic as always i simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress no other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with steele and no actress ever will besides steele the movie s cast contains another stunning beauty margarete robsahm and she also delivers a great performance george rivi re s performance as alan foster is great and the rest of the performances are also very good castle of blood is outstanding in many departments barbara steele delivers one of her best performances the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison the atmosphere is incredibly eerie the film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere gothic beauty and the art of terror in short castle of blood is one of the most atmospheric and greatest gothic horror films ever made and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre 
for those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls think again there is a totally different side to the japanese animation yakitate japan is one of those shows it is a sweet natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread his universe is all about creating a japanese bread that can match with the famous european breads the show is as wacky as they come and i m sure that non japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes but it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show in the world of yakitate it is not uncommon for people to look like they ve just had an orgasm after eating bread the bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers from time traveling to swimming like a fish that weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows i ve watched in a while 
when i first started watching this anime i never thought that something about making bread could actually be interesting but thankfully i was mistaken from the moment i started watching it anime just pulled into the world of bread making i was hooked the biggest advantage of this anime is it s humor which is very intelligent and very funny with some recurring gags but the animation soundtrack and character development are below average while these disadvantages aren t seen so much in the first episodes because of the great job on this anime it really starts to show in the last episodes when the reactions and recurring gags just grow old and aren t as funny as before as far as i m concerned if this anime had ended with episode i would have given it a but the last episodes just leave a bitter aftertaste which sadly can t be washed away by the awesome episodes 
i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that it s tv movies five seconds into the picture this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy well crafted mood that is established from the very start while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver b c the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos excellent acting 
another comment about this film made it sound lousy given talking pictures were so new i think the script and acting were good davis was so young and fresh she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect yet it is great to see her this way still learning the craft so many clich s came from this film and it seems this film blazed some trails for the next years my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture for being and how we view the early part of last century as uptight i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments 
somerset maugham s characters are brought to life in rko s of human bondage but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel with bette davis star making performance sucking up all of the energy otherwise it s the story of leslie howard as philip carey he dreams of becoming a painter but is told he has no talent for the arts as the film progresses mr howard s struggles instead to become a doctor his efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts though successful in medicine his painting seemed easier also note the symbolism of his disability a club foot explained in the film along the way right away in this version howard becomes infatuated with waitress davis as mildred rogers davis characterization of mildred is extraordinary culminating in a spectacular speech when she tells howard among other things that she had to wipe my mouth after kissing him howard also performs well but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis so their performances are wasted still a film to watch for the acting including some good supporting players bette davis characterization was famous for inspiring a write in campaign for the best actress academy award for the record she placed third the results were claudette colbert it happened one night norma shearer the barretts of wimpole street bette davis of human bondage grace moore one night of love of human bondage john cromwell leslie howard bette davis reginald denny
the movie may be great i just watched it last night but feel unable to give an honest opinion of it because i read the book first the book is so much better than the movie that i was disappointed with the film if you plan to watch of human bondage don t read the book beforehand on the other hand the book is so good and contains so much more than the love affair phillip has with mildred you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie i do not make this claim lightly i average reading a book every days and read such disparate authors as danielle steel ovid faulkner plato and shakespeare of human bondage gets my vote as one of the top ten novels ever written 
this adaptation of somerset maugham s novel put bette davis on the map as a movie actress she might have won an academy award for her performance but the films was made on loan so her studio didn t push for her her acting in this one doesn t come off well by today s standards as the heartless waitress who jerks philip a sensitive medical student around and nearly ruins his life davis is way too shrill almost demonic director john cromwell who usually elicited good performances from his actresses was perhaps overwhelmed by this one davis is watchable for sure but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human i imagine the character of millie as quieter less feminine than davis with maybe a touch of the tomboy davis is such a strong immediate presence that s there s no air of mystery to her which makes philip s attraction to her seem more overtly masochistic than it should be as philip leslie howard is excellent his wan somewhat wilted good looks are perfect for this failed aesthete nor does he impose a personal interpretation on the part as say dirk bogarde might have done which gives his work a rare clarity he seems completely in control here as he should be playing a man with a rational intellect who is in the grip of irrational emotions he cannot manage or even fully satisfy as the object of his affections moves him in ways he cannot understand howard was a fine actor too often cast in standard romantic parts which compelled him to fall back on charm which he doesn t use here it s been so long since i ve read the book i don t feel comfortable commenting on the movie s faithfulness to it i think it captures the spirit of the story well enough and that it has in howard a perfect philip carey the sexual undercurrents are muted and at times philip behaves so masochistically that in the absence of strong sex feelings makes one wonder about the character s sanity surely not mr maugham s intention thanks to howard s performance philip remains firmly in focus as one can see in his various responses to and yearnings for millie the extremes to which a reasonable intellect will go to understand the irrational in himself and in others overall a very good film a little stilted at times due to its age it evokes london nicely and is well acted for the most part 
i just saw of human bondage for the first time a few days ago and wow what a mysterious and almost spooky film i loved how the music went with the pace of each step of philip s feet it gave me the chills for some reason one of the greatest aspects of this film is that you get to see bette davis coming into herself right before your eyes she s great not necessarily because this is her best work but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious gritty and unflinching as an actress in bette was a risk taker always wanting to be different and this is right about when she started to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it if you re a true lover of film it s amazing to see she just had a way of delivering a line that made the part and the film for that matter belong to her like a mass of music and fire that s me an old kazoo and some sparklers or but you are blanche you are in that chair or with all my heart i still love the man i killed those are from a few of her films but you get my drift she was just so brave sassy and exotic looking with those beautiful big eyes after seeing this i can t believe it was remade twice leslie howard was gorgeous so calm and persistent needing to be loved i thought he was adorable and couldn t understand how everyone wasn t falling for him but then again everyone was except mildred he did a great job the only thing that i didn t like was something that was common with the writing in the early films they d make a character so hateful that it s almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place the performances were great but in real life philip would have never been interested in mildred that s just the simple truth see it 
this is a well directed film from john cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the version of the prsoner of zenda set in a london that only hollywood could manage atmospheric but nothing like the real thing it is a story of obsession and thwarted love from the novel by somerset maughan i was looking forward to seeing it on dvd as i had never seen it before and being a great admirer of bette davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones so i bought it well she looked fine but i m sorry to say her london cockney accent just made me laugh bette davis was one of the greatest film actors make no mistake but here she did make one it was impossible to take her character seriously it wasn t as gruesome as the dick van dyke mary poppins cockney accent but close in the other major role was leslie howard and he did it superbly he was a subtle and intelligent actor the supporting actors acquit themselves well worth watching despite ms davis vocal gymnastics 
bette davis cockney accent in this film is absolutely appalling i totally understand that americans and other nationalities mightn t realise this and that s fine but believe me it s about half as good as dick van dyke s cockney accent in mary poppins and that was a right load of old pony slipped into london vernacular there many apologies the remarkable thing to me is that the strange accents and exaggerated acting styles don t detract from the films power of human bondage is a fascinating piece of cinema despite its superficial faults it also has to be viewed in perspective the technical and cultural limitations of film making at the time have to be appreciated and given those limitations john cromwell does a very good job directing the camera and allowing the narrative to develop cinematically rather than solely via the mannered acting and stilted dialogue a fine example of his skillful direction is the scene set at victoria station it is beautifully conceived shot and edited note too the stark shots of the prostrate mildred towards the end of the film they owe more to the early days of artistic film making than the sanitised formulaic world of the studio that was about to dominate the themes of the film are universally familiar and compelling ones sexual obsession unrequited love scorned passion self loathing manipulative relationships social divides and youthful folly though the dialogue is often rather hackneyed the difficult task of portraying these themes and the inner lives of the characters is tackled well albeit in a low key way some of the scenes of obsession and emotional rejection are uncomfortable to watch but the story doesn t descend into clich we re aware that the characters even the poisonous mildred are both victims and perpetrators and that their actions are motivated by their misunderstanding of each others feelings as well as by wilful selfishness whilst naive in style the story reaches to the complex heart of the human condition and the mannered nature of the acting and the occasionally grating exchanges don t diminish the veracity of the work of human bondage was one of the films that got bette davis noticed in hollywood and whilst watching it you are conscious of being witness at the birth of a celebrated career her unconventional beauty and screen charisma no one flounced or did disdain quite like ms davis grab your attention from her first appearance whilst hers is definitely the memorable performance in the film leslie howard is also excellent as the sensitive and fragile student philip carey they are a good combination though why oh why didn t he help her with that terrible terrible accent 
enjoyable in spite of leslie howard s performance mr howard plays philip as a flat uninteresting character one is supposed to feel sorry for this man however i find myself cheering bette davis mildred ms davis gives one her finest performances she received an academy award nomination thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life be sure not to miss when mildred tells philip exactly how she feels about him 
this movie is about sexual obsession bette davis plays mildred this is a woman who men are drawn to not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious there is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her she works as a waitress in a coffee shop she can t read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt it is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her one day phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her he starts buying her things even pays for her apartment meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it he dreams about her like she is a angel but she is no angel he is constantly thinking about her his med school grades are even failing so what the nookie is too good he wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy she always lets phil know she really doesn t have love feelings for him all of time he is heart broken but he meets another woman they seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the bimbo mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed phillip takes her in again but she starts going out with a friend of his the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out she does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him well it doesn t work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up oh we have a club foot that he has problems about even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it he meets another girl named sally we have a march of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for mildred well he has no school tuition can t find a job finally sally and her dad takes him in not before another march of time montage showing him going downhill soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor meanwhile he finds mildred needs him again she has tb meanwhile he is still leading sally down the primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship finally the bimbo dies and phillip declares he is free now and he will marry sally i wished she told him to stuff it now i know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points but i feel phillip was the bad guy yes mildred is a strumpet but he knows it and he keeps coming back mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers i guess the sex wasn t as good but in any case he dogs those women waiting for mildred not only that but the man who gets mildred pregnant is already married and when philip asks him what he intends to do about baby apparently the baby s name he laughs is off he has no intention in supporting her and baby and he is wealthy sally s father who has children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist philip doesn t seem to refute his feelings either men are using mildred as a boy toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain to me it is philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for mildred 
this movie does contradict the first one as far as the origins of the care bears and the care bear cousins goes i won t deny that however if you look at part ii as a separate film then it s a very good movie i remember watching this in the early s and fitting into its targeted demographic audience then and absolutely loving it much more than the first movie not that i didn t enjoy that one too it s just that this one seemed to have a little something extra to it sure it s darker than the first one too but perhaps maybe that s why it s so good and it s dark in deeper kind of subtle way too that kids may not fully understand but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off and adults watching will surely get quicker as i have now watching this film again now in my mid twenties where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit demon in exchange for something else get the picture but simply watching that as a child sure as i said it may have been a little scary but nothing traumatizing in fact if anything it gave me another fantasy game i could play when i was that age i can t tell you the number of times i used to pretend dark heart wanted to imprison me have me help him capture the care bears tried to make me turn over to his dark side and other things like that etc so this movie was also good for my imagination and it s also got great emotional depth to it too i used to watch it at least once a week also hadley kay was the perfect choice for the voice of dark heart i always thought so and i always will now it s just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available sometimes i just want to hear growing up without watching the movie as good as it is what good is love and caring if it can t save her 
 spoiler alert w somerset maugham classic on film about a love obsessed young man who s abused hurt and humiliated by the object of his obsession to the point of losing everything he has only to find true love in the end under the most unusual circumstances leslie howard plays the role of philip carey a sensitive young artiest in paris trying to make a living by selling his paintings told by a local art expert that his work is not at all good enough to be sold to the art going public philip decides to go back to his native england and study medicine and become a physician in order to help others philip being born with a club foot is very hypersensitive about his awkward condition and makes up for that by being a very pleasant and friendly person one afternoon philip is at a local caf with a fellow medical student and spots pretty waitress mildred rogers bette davis and immediately falls in love with her mildred at first rebuffs the love sick philip but later realizing just what a sap he is takes advantage of his feelings for her mildred has him spend himself into poverty buying her gifts and taking her out to the theater every time she off from work phlip also falls behind on his studies by paying so much attention towards mildred at the medical university and fails his final exams going into hock buying an engagement ring for mildred in an attempt to ask for her hand in marriage the cold hearted mildred tells the startled philip that she s already engaged to be married to emil miller alan hale it turns out that he s one of the customers at the caf that she s always flirting with philip broke and heart sick slowly get his life back together and later retakes his medical exam and passes it and at the same time finds a new love in nora fay johnson a writer for a local love magazine later to philip s shock and surprise mildred walks back into his life mildred telling philip that her husband emil who s child she s carrying threw her out of the house has the kind and understanding philip take her back at the expense of nora who was very much in love with him it later turns out that mildred wasn t married to emil but had a child out of wedlock by having an illicit affair with him emil it turns out was already married as before mildred takes advantage of philip s kind heart for her and her baby daughter where he supports them with food medical attention and shelter to the point where he again goes broke and can t continue his studies ending with her leaving philip after having a very heated and emotional encounter with him out on the streets with nowhere to go philip is taken in by mr athanly reginald owens who he once treated at the hospital and falls in love with his daughter sally frances dee later philip has his club foot corrected at the medical center and with the help of mr athenly gets back to being a doctor it s then when he encounters mildred again who s really at the end of her rope dying of tuberculosis and having lost her daughter she s all alone with no one to look after her philip now well to do and respected in medical circles does all he can to help the sick and poor mildred but in the end she succumbed to her illness and passes away mildred had the love and devotion in philip all those years that he was in love with her but choose to abuse him and have affairs with man who were just like her cold unfeeling and selfish in the end mildred got back just what she gave to the kind and sensitive philip she became both unloved and alone philip found in the sweet and caring sally everything that mildred wasn t and in the end also found the true love that he was looking for all of his life 
after movies and three years of working in hollywood bette davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be reckoned with as mildred rogers davis burst forth with a completely unsympathetic role of a slutty waitress who becomes the target of leslie howard s affections and already eager to sink her teeth into a role like this she had no qualms of the awful things her character was meant to do throughout the course of the film and the awful transformation she would undergo it also has been widely noted that her performance here one of the few things that makes this slightly uneven movie watchable has been the one to remember even after two remakes and the scenes where she rips into howard have made cinema history at circa minutes the story moves at a nice pace telling the story of philip carey howard as his life crosses that of the destructive mildred rogers over and over again howard and davis chemistry is all but non existent davis sustained in an interview much later in life she personally didn t care much for howard s iciness towards her and that helped her act even worse in character towards him as mildred all the same the two seem awkward with one another their scenes together remain stiff only salvaged by the ferocious acidity davis brings to her lines and her own nervous presence then again cromwell s direction has a certain stiltedness about itself that fails to come through at times he tries to fill in some space whenever davis is not there with dissolves and montages indicating the passing of time a calendar superimposed over a changing frances dee all much in the style back then this was before technicalities and complicated camera angles came into being and in essence the visual story is a simplified bare essentials translation of the somerset maugham s novel which is saying a lot since at pages of human bondage would have been indeed hard to film even then storywise it feels that philip carey may be something of a glutton for punishment since there is no discernible sexual attraction between he and mildred and to compound that mildred never hides her displeasure from the get go howard s performance never seems to go through much external emotion his eyes are constantly sad his expression never veers too far away from lost he could almost be a distant cousin to william hurt in the accidental tourist dejected hurt and absolutely passive but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women played by kay johnson and frances dee are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affections interestingly johnson s norah once she realizes carey will never fall for her is the one who sums the story up with her observation that people are bound to other people she is bound to carey as carey is bound to mildred and mildred herself is bound to miller or men who fit the role of provider in her short but memorable scene she s the one who holds the essence of the story s moral 
brilliant film the next best film to the drunken master jackie chan i recently bought it on an original vhs and i haven t seen this film for years but still as good as it was back then the acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film and many other old fashioned chinese kung fu movies great the choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic i have never seen the th chamber of shaolin but know it is the same film but gordon liu plays san te but san te in thr return to the th chamber is played by a different character it has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung fu 
i thought this would be a sequel to the original th chamber of shaolin but actually it s more of a light hearted sister to the original gordon liu still stars as a would be hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those pesky manchus but this time around it s lighter and more comedic the film centres around the local dye mill where wages are cut due to the hiring of new manchurian bosses liu plays chao who is able to fool the mill bosses into thinking he is a shaolin monk possessing almost magical kung fu skill but his luck runs out he is exposed as a fraud and he promises the mill workers that he will go to the shaolin monastery to learn kung fu and return to protect them the comedy really begins at the monastery where chao makes several bungling attempts to get accepted this sets up lots of really funny moments and lots of great fight choreography continuing in the th chamber tradition we see all kinds of neat and interesting and supremely hokey training methods at the monastery as well as creative uses of wooden benches as weapons also unique and of note is the blending of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold building chao is not accepted as a student at shaolin but is made to build bamboo scaffolding for the year restoration of the monastery on the dvd i bought there is a special on bamboo scaffold building and the inspiration that director lau kar leung drew from it this is a craft many hundreds perhaps thousands of years old and in hong kong scaffolding is still built of bamboo even on large high rises though the west exclusively uses steel tubes and clamps as a result of his scaffolding work chao develops a special style of kung fu when asked what kind it is he hilariously replies scaffolding kung fu which he first tests during a dust up with the monastery s abbot in the final confrontation with the manchus there is a dazzling array of creative uses for bamboo poles and ties from a comedy perspective i think it s one of the best of the kung fu genre as a kung fu film in general it also stands out i recommend it to anyone 
i saw this movie once on late night t v and knew it was the best movie ever this is one of the few kung fu movies with a decent plot the progression of the main character is seamless the whole movie is great 
return to the th chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic th chamber of shaolin in which gordon liu played shan te a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter in this sequel liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten he imitates the original shan te tries all manner of tricks to get into shaolin temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses its a classic light hearted martial arts tale with the ace production values of the shaw brothers and the sure footed direction of lui chia liang the choreography is fantastic throughout whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and gordon liu s performance as are the others particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material the film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander more violent and sweeping shaw brothers films but few have such a magical blend of slapstick unique training and fighting with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good full of light hearted joy its impossible not to give this the highest score 
this movie has a lot of comedy not dark and gordon liu shines in this one he displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up his training is unorthodox and who would ve thought knot tying could be so deadly lots of great stunts and choreography very creative add johnny wang in the mix and you ve got an awesome final showdown don t mess with manchu thugs they re ruthless 
this is simply the epitome of what a made for tv movie should be it was a lazy sunday afternoon when my wife and i were in grad school that we stumbled upon this the cheesy acting the poorly written script the good ol boys the ridiculous yet somehow obvious clich and banal premise the riding in pickup trucks with your propped up wife corpse it has it all you will meet familiar characters gold digging hussy stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own friends who know better daddy who knows better but drives son away and the wife corpse propped up in a pick up wow and the title several things in our lives have been texas tragedies since watching this beauty everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal 
yes a tap dancing horror thriller with shelley and debbie goody goody this is demented and campy fun and part of the guignol cycle of the s that leaked into the s released as a double feature with the burt reynolds comedy fuzz this mad scare is so bonkers as to be throughly entertaining like a mix of day of the locust the other and baby jane i suggest any prospective viewer take on the idea that this is almost meant to be skew iff and sit with someone with whom you can shriek and elbow all through it actually get drunk whilst you watch it on cheap champagne again with many s film ideas they are also about delusion the struggle of the time for a better life getting bitter and twisted by emotional madness falling into murder but this one is just plain crazy it also reminds me a lot of bloody mama the de niro winters shlock fest that makes this film look positively glorious 
i had watched and recorded this a few years back on local tv and having been underwhelmed by it i subsequently erased the tape however when it was released by mgm as part of a midnite movie double feature dvd of curtis harrington shelley winters films for a very affordable price i couldn t resist giving it a second look this has since gone out of print actually i received the dvd a few months ago but only now with harrington s passing did i get to it thankfully this time around i was more receptive to the film and in fact now consider it one of the more satisfying whatever happened to baby jane imitations with whom incidentally it shared screenwriter henry farrell the film offers a splendid evocation of s depression america with its child star craze and sensational murders exploited during the fake newsreel opening it s stylishly made kudos to lucien ballard s cinematography and the set design by eugene lourie and boasts an effective david raksin score shelley winters debbie reynolds and michael macliammoir deliver excellent performances the latter is especially impressive as the larger than life and vaguely sinister diction coach though he ultimately proves a mere red herring also featured are dennis weaver and agnes moorehead hers is only a cameo really as the evangelist she plays is mostly heard over the radio many seemed to regret the inclusion of musical numbers by the kids including an amusing mae west imitation but i personally wasn t bothered by them the film does slightly overstay its welcome due to an unhurried pace and perhaps needlessly convoluted plot reynolds a musical star herself is ideally cast as the dancing school owner and despite their on set rivalry she and winters work well together the latter in fact gives a more balanced depiction of paranoia and insanity than in whoever slew auntie roo the narrative then comes up with a number of ironic twists that lead up to the expected grand guignol type denouement apparently the film was toned down it originally contained more gore and even a suggestion of lesbianism by producer martin ransohoff against harrington s wishes in order to get a pg rating 
a vastly underrated black comedy the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow baby jane reynolds and winters are mothers of young convicted murderers a nod to compulsion who run away to hide in hollywood they run a school for would be movie tots a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by awful stage moms debbie in her blonde wig i m a harlow you re more a marion davies she tells winters leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad weaver she also does a deliciously funny tango and over all gives an outstanding performance unlike anything she d done before the atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie it looks wonderful with great period detail s lots of lovely swipes at hollywood and the terrifying movie tot micheal macliammoir has a ball as the drama coach hamilton starr he purrs two r s but prophetic nonetheless see it and love it 
the most bizarre of the cinematic sub genres is the so called the great ladies of the grand guignol camp horror films which combined over the top melodrama with gothic thrills and always starred by seasoned and almost forgotten actress from hollywood golden age in unflattering roles of either long suffering victims or screeching evil harpies this genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed strut their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterday what s the matter with helen is the last drop of this sub genre with stunning performances of both debbie reynolds and shelley winters as the troubled mothers of two convicted criminals who run away from their past to the sunny california in the s to open a talent school to milk out the eagerly mothers who want their daughters to be the next shirley temple in california debbie gets happiness clients tango tap dancing and a new love interest dennis weaver meanwhile shelley gets wacko with horrible flashbacks menacing anonymous calls menacing strangers menacing agnes moorehead as a radio evangelist cute little rabbits and an unfortunate encounter with an electric fan ouch the sloppy script penned by henry farrell the man who started all this genre with whatever happened to baby jane along with master director robert aldrich joan crawford and bette davis is full of plot holes red herrings and wasted opportunities that could had made this movie great the underlying themes of twisted motherhood with debbie and shelley s characters as failed mothers and the overbearing mommies of the child stars and obsessive female bonding debbie and shelley relationship and the fact that the few male characters of this movie are either sinister or sleazy even dennis weaver dream boat texan are wasted instead we get debbie reynolds musicals interludes and dancing tots although fun to watch take too much screen time of what is supposedly to be a psychological chiller but still this movie is highly entertaining the two stars and curtis harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws the movie recreation of the s is colorful and elegant look at debbie s clothes made with a very tight budget the increasing atmosphere of madness and hysteria is genuinely creepy with a shocking finale that will haunt you for days and you wouldn t easily forget that silly goody goody song that runs through the movie either and seeing an increasingly mad shelley winters screw every one of debbie reynolds chances at happiness is a hoot to watch out of 
a very strange and compelling movie it s about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door to door fundraiser salesman the director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life there is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something i do as frequently as i should one of the more memorable films i ve seen in a long while hasn t left my mind and i look forward to future efforts by bronstein fantastic performances all around the simple line i really appreciate it is now iconic to me 
as a child i preferred the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark i always sat down and watched the first one as i got older i learned to prefer this one what i do think is that this film is too dark for infants but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more it doesn t seem as dark as it was back when you were a child this movie in my opinion is better than the first one everything is so much deeper it may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one the cubs are just too adorable i rewind that flying my colors scene i tend to annoy everyone by singing it the sound track is great a big hand to carol and dean parks i love every song in this movie i have downloaded them all and is all i am listening to i m listening to our beginning also known as recalling at the moment i have always preferred this sound track to the first one although i just totally love carol kings song in the first movie care a lot i think the animation is great the animation in both movies are fantastic i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent it was really surprising there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great but it is i do not think it is weird strange i think it is a wonderful movie basically this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon dark heart the end is surprising and again beats any pokemon movie with the care bears moral issues it leaves an effect on you again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality 
romantic comedies can really go either way you know you ll see one that s really sappy and you ll think you want something more realistic then you ll see one that s realistic but it might be too dull to keep you interested or maybe you ll see one that does everything right but just fails to make you smile romantic comedies are tough movies you go into them with a lot of expectations and usually whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you of course if you ve got a girl next to you and you re a guy like me it probably doesn t matter all that much whether the movie s any good you ve got other things on your mind for you i say go get her tiger for the rest of us i say see _a guy thing_ it s a lot of fun because _a guy thing_ knows you re going in to this movie with expectations so it doesn t pretend that its guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams and it s not his wife plot is going to make everyone happy sure maybe you like it but maybe it doesn t ring true or you think it s cruel _a guy thing_ covers that what _a guy thing_ does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast i ve seen in a long time so if you don t the main plotline you ve still got something to make you smile whether we re talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen like larry miller pretty woman best in show james brolin traffic julie hagerty airplane david koechner saturday night live and conan o brien regular dirty work austin powers ii or thomas lennon the state and viva variety or new faces like shawn hatosy the faculty or colin foo saving silverman we re talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film s inspired characterisation steal the show time after time and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days and that s not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along because it s very sweet and terribly well done jason lee mallrats chasing amy dogma etc is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control and selma blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is a lot of the success of the movie though falls on julia stiles the right girl in the right place at the wrong time and she wears it well not since gosh i don t know when have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy of course it s all in the closeups the voice and the subtle smiles but it s magical and it s one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place but julie stiles s slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead on in their classic simplicity this is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types makes them fall over each other to make you laugh and then comes through with a great deal of heart a guy thing is a movie you ve definitely seen before and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it we haven t really seen any new romantic comedies since shakespeare the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl a guy thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play for the record it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of it and guys i think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as jason lee s friends in this movie i m not going to spoil it for you but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema i suggest you just say it s a guy thing and leave it at that 
i think the deal with this movie is that it has about minutes of really really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesn t live up to the trailer it s a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise and i think i m seeing from the comments people having a love hate relationship with this movie however if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast i think it s still pretty good julia stiles is clearly the star she s so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with lee the rest of the cast of course lee s testosterone filled coworkers his elegant mother in law his fratlike friend jim and his bride to be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make stiles stand out in the first place lee doesn t live up to his costars i don t think but you could view that as more that they re hard to live up to maybe that s one source of disappointment the movie itself despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don t come off as funny as the writer s intended is still pretty funny and i found a rather intelligent film the themes of conformity and taking the safe route seemed to cleverly align on several layers for example there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice the other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which jason lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck example the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part while it wasn t as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent but overall it s still a good movie 
recap the morning after his bachelor party paul is woken by his mother in law to be and discovers that there is a woman sleeping beside him unfortunately its a waitress from the bar and not his fianc e and suddenly she turns up everywhere the toll booth at the freeway and at his parent in laws dinner and it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex boyfriend had him followed and photographed it is not only about saving his wedding it is about survival comments actually much better than expected not the sweet romantic comedy i expected but something much funnier something with a little edge this movie wasn t afraid to take the jokes a little further and jason lee does now how to deliver comedy especially when his character is half panicked and deep in trouble as he is here and he got nice support from beautiful ladies julia stiles and selma blair and actually i thought lochlyn munro did a nice part as the ex so more emphasis on comedy than romance and the end result was good i enjoyed it very much 
i happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels my expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie in a guy thing jason lee plays paul a straight laced seattle based fellow who is about to marry his fianc e karen selma blair and settle down to an unchallenging life of middle class domesticity we first meet paul at his bachelor party where he professes no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activities his surprisingly few buddies encourage in case he s a bit naughty and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and strife of course the next thing paul knows it s the morning after the night before he s in bed with a naked hula dancer and his mother in law phones to inform him that karen is on her way over oh and the hula dancer is karen s cousin becky julia stiles from this small acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misfortune as paul scrabbles from misadventure to misadventure trying to cover up what he s done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a dutiful family oriented good guy who s super excited about his forthcoming nuptials his efforts to ensure karen remains none the wiser about any potential wrong doing on his part ironically forces paul closer and closer to the fun loving becky forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been mapped out for him the movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance definitely worth a watch 
the lady from shanghai is proof that the great genius orson welles could direct a mainstream movie if he wanted to by comparison to his other more artistic works this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness and almost no esoteric elements the exception being of course the final scene in the hall of mirrors widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of film it alone is worth the cost of a rental the sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful rita hayworth her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters even the great mr welles 
pure orson welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment big dummy that i am plot is so complex that i still don t know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost the shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed that scene alone is worth the price of admission this is the only time that rita hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character no one but welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond no one should miss this picture 
despite loving rita hayworth finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler symbolic aspects of the cinematography the lady from shanghai didn t quite work for me i had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure and in a film that s mostly people talking with each other in various situations that s quite a problem the lady from shanghai ended up at a very low c or a for me the lady from shanghai is really all about orson welles character michael o hara o hara sees elsa rosalie bannister rita hayworth in central park on a carriage ride and hits on her later he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him o hara is a seaman from ireland and the globetrotting elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband arthur everett sloane a very famous and powerful california defense attorney they talk o hara into working for them despite his initial reservations it seems to him and to the audience that elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and o hara doesn t want to get involved shortly after going to work on their yacht a strange man george grisby glenn anders who says he s arthur s partner shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble eventually grisby asks o hara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme foolishly o hara agrees naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealed maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far i m not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he produces writes directs and consumes most of the screen time i haven t seen anywhere near the majority of welles work yet but i ve tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performance arty i love f for fake v rit s et mensonges for example and i even kind of like his performance in casino royale when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table but citizen kane never did much for me despite giving it or chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low the same as my current score for the lady from shanghai welles performance and the dialogue he s written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me he s a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monotone he tends to sound like he s reading his performance reminded me of what i ve seen of welles version of moby dick listed on imdb as but completed in it can also be seen in orson welles the one man band where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that he s inherently sublimely dramatic i m also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me too as for the other performances i can only say i thought hayworth did an excellent job of course she s gorgeous which doesn t hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to me i never quite bought his character his handicap and so on and anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesn t seem to fit welles often shoots him in close up and anders almost always has some over exaggerated manic expression on his sweaty face structurally the lady from shanghai is very uneven the first minutes or so are extremely bland and soap operatic although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique once grisby introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from shanghai becomes a crime mystery film it s too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellence the ending is more action oriented less dialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director if the lady from shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crime mystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a the final scenes are easily s as welles shifts from a hitchcockian suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese amusement park the funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time it s well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolism the cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually can t make up for the problems in the foreground welles blocks scenes with skill there are lots of attractively filmed settings from central park to acapulco to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of acapulco to the maze like caribbean streets the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the san francisco aquarium and so on the romance material for which the aquarium serves as one backdrop is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romance surely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from shanghai much more than i did and of course it s worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the lady from shanghai isn t exactly a terrible film in my view but it s dangerously close to not passing proceed with caution 
this cartoon was strange but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies we have a girl at a camp with low self esteem and hardly any other friends except a brother and sister who are just a miserable as she is she reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity arises she literally makes a pact with a devil like demon i found this film to be very true to life and just when things couldn t be worse the girl sees what she s done she feels remorse and then changes and then she helps this dark mystical creature learn the human quality of love the twins improve too by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too a very positive message for children though some elements of the film was strange it was and still is a rather enjoyable film the music from stephen bishop tootsie songs made the film even better
the lady from shanghai is weird even by the standards of its eminent director orson welles whose last hollywood film this was for many a moon it s a kind of post modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular and it concerns a happy go lucky irish sailor played by welles who falls in with a mysterious lady rita hayworth who was married to welles at the time and her crippled and probably impotent husband played with a brainy malevolent gusto by everett sloan a long sea voyage follows with welles in tow as bodyguard and the plot thickens when sloan s law partner glenn anders turns up and starts making trouble by giving odd speeches about suicide and other morbid topics that suggest that the man is on the verge of mental breakdown a murder plot ensues and all sorts of calamities follow for welles and his employers and at this point the story fuzzy and told at a leisurely pace thus far goes off the deep end and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and urgency its story does not by itself possess and the result is a very watchable and often pleasing at all times incomprehensible mess it s hard to know what welles was trying to do with this film aside from maybe resurrect his career in hollywood by making a vehicle for his wife but self destruction intervenes as it often does with welles and miss hayworth has never looked less fetching that she is also cast as a femme fatale seems peculiar as aside from her beauty her most appealing trait as a screen personality was lovableness a quality she does not possess in this picture the director himself is strangely unappealing and hammy at o hara the presumably easygoing sailor since welles for all his many gifts was not known as an easy man to work with this is a role that twenty or thirty years later sean connery or robert shaw might have been able to breath life into welles does not the most interesting performance in the movie is glenn anders as grisby sloan s loony treacherous law partner anders works wonders with the part and is photographed to look bizarre while his scenes end on odd sour notes and are often choppily edited but for all this he manages to make grisby s derangement palpable and disturbing and anticipates in a genteel way the more flamboyant method actors of the fifties such as timothy carey there is a question that nags me about this film what was welles trying to say he was a highly talented and intelligent man and tended to make statements in his movies which whether one agrees with his world view or not were brilliantly put forth i think i have an answer or a partial one welles was summing up his movie career he had reached the end of his rope in the hollywood studio system he despised and he knew it the lady from shanghai isn t exactly a nose thumbing at the studio moguls of the day but i suspect that it is in its portrait of amoral rival big shot lawyers read producers expressing welles opinion of the power brokers of hollywood that he presented himself as a rootless sailor is telling welles himself was certainly an inveterate traveler and he rarely lived in one place for long he was hired by a studio to provide it with a big prestigious film citizen kane which caused a firestorm of controversy from which he never fully recovered this may be the issue that dares not speak its name in this film which is to say welles personal failure in not getting over the shock of his newness in the movie colony and his inability to deliver the goods as promised the mere fact of him turning up in hollywood like his mere presence in the film could not forestall disasters well beyond his control that he presented himself in the movie as an amiable naive outsider shows a lack of self knowledge on welles part he was much more of an inside player than he let on and i imagine that he despised his knowledge of the worldlier aspects of life and himself for knowing so much 
what can i say it s a damn good movie see it if you still haven t great camera works and lighting techniques awesome just awesome orson welles is incredible the lady from shanghai can certainly take the place of citizen kane 
surreal film noir released soon after the real genre defining classics the maltese falcon double indemnity and the postman always rings twice welles films shouldn t be evaluated against others he was playing by different rules in fact he was playing this starts where other femme fatale films leave off so the vaguely logical but interesting whodunit is embellished with a display of wellesian scenes typical rapid fire style dialog lots of hard boiled philosophy and unusual acting good hayworth presumably intentionally one dimensional to welles genre may have meant formula but he seemed to like using mysteries as backgrounds for his entertainments 
this could be well have been the definitive film noir of all time had not the columbia studios cut so much of orson welles s original what we are left with is a flawed yet brilliant film that showcases the overwhelming talent of welles as an actor director and rita hayworth as a serious dramatic talent the lady from shanghai is film noir at it s most sizzling and confusing welles with an uneven accent portrays michael o hara a journeyman irishman who after a fateful encounter with the seductive dangerous elsa bannister hayworth in a great performance finds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewman on her and her crippled husband s everett sloane yacht elsa or rosalie as michael likes to call her plays the innocent helpless doll very well ensnaring o hara in her web as the lovers conduct a not so secret affair at sea arthur bannister s partner in his law firm george grisby glenn anders comes aboard he is a weird untrustworthy figure who offers michael a unique proposal he will get to assist grisby in the faking of grisby s death so it looks murder the plan is for michael to get off a technicality and run off into the sun with elsa but things do not go to plan hayworth delivers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrayal at times she seems genuinely vulnerable and child like at others brutal world weary and hard always she is brilliantly beautiful whether he situation calls for her to be dripping wet in a swimsuit or dressed in black brandishing a gun hayworth is beautifully photographed here and she is a far cry from her famous gilda role her then husband orson welles cut off her trademark auburn locks for a dyed blonde crop angering columbia boss harry cohn it was a terrific marketing ploy and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully she is not the sympathetic femme fatale that gilda is here instead she is a predatory black hearted dame who sees murder as a very useful option the welles and hayworth pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in their marriage they would divorce after the film was made so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship they are hateful not romantic lovers in this so it s hard to gauge whether or not they had real chemistry on screen certainly every encounter is potent and filled with raw sexuality with welles as the fall guy he even admits it himself in the film and rita as the double crossing babe welles character is the typical noir drifter with not much sense as welles voice over proves to use o hara indeed does not use his brain very much expect to be thinking of her elsa welles usually played intelligent charismatic fellows so his turn here as the dim witted michael is unusual and very interesting indeed welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it well everett sloane is suitably slimy as hayworth s crippled husband one wonders why he hires michael it is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically so why does he invite a threat on board one interpretation could be that michael provides the service to his wife that bannister cannot in his crippled state there is definitely something to that theory with a lot of implications toward elsa s behaviour before she met her husband was she some sort of prostitute and grisby s knowledge of bannister s most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenes this is a jumbled convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed we are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot as with most noirs welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches including the justifiably famous hall of mirrors climax it s a terrific scene one ending that can almost obliterate the faults earlier on in the movie and lift it into greatness this fun house scene is visually stunning with a dali like feel to the painted sets apparently orson painted them himself subtle visual imagery utilized throughout the film by welles enhances the plot and makes this a thought provoking experience the dialogue is scorching and confusing delivered superbly by rita s alternately breathy low voice and helpless high pitched little girl voice hayworth proves her acting capabilities in this one and proves that she is the ultimate femme fatale of noir it s a pity only a slight one as rita was a brilliant dancer that she did so many delightful yet frothy and often forgettable musicals for columbia in the s instead of darkly themed noir like this she was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent 
the first mystery is to guess what welles original film was like that makes this a real adventure to see an incomplete skeleton and using cinematic forensics imagine the beautiful woman it once supported if you do you will both see and experience perhaps one of the best film mysteries ever as mysteries go the narrative is rather ordinary a simple diversion one jealous husband as red herring what s rather miraculous is welles placement of the story in an artificial eye seeing a dark dark multifaceted world the first real noir but even darker it s not an obviously twisted world unless you think about the camera what we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common for all the celebration kane was a success because of the great drama and story the camera s eye was shocking but experimental welles would go from there to explore the mystery narrative and the self reference of shakespeare with this eye othello and macbeth are both begun in this period and i consider them part of a single vision with this the noir feel here hinges on the notion that people are not in charge of their lives even a little they are manipulated by random factors in the environment so in telling this story welles has to make the environment into a character several characters as suspects in the mystery thus we have the famous lighting blocking and angles we know and have since seen countless times and we have the deliberately closed sets the park yacht picnic area aquarium dock courtroom chinese theater and funhouse i am certain that what was cut by the barbarians was lots and lots of external narrative dealing not with character but with these strange environments my own solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did it among the other character environments introduced as suspects in other words the manipulation of black irish who we know from notes and one scene typing at the union hall was an aspiring novelist was neither a force of human conspiracy the park or the civilized version the courtroom nor of nature the picnic or the civilized version the aquarium instead it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for amusement this is of course a self reference to what welles is doing putting these people including himself through hell for our own caprice a matter underscored by the peking opera set with welles doped up and of course leading to the funhouse where the environment directly tinkers with perception more about the self reference surely there is conscious comment on his relationship with his soon to be exwife but i believe there is strong subconscious comment on his own taunting the environment in which he worked the studio environment surely welles was as much screwed with and in much the same way as his character and that screwing took the form of the murder of this film leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment that poor rita comes from china ties up the whole thing the chinese theater the expected rape from above the loss of the woman the investment in environment beyond all 
made in and released in the lady and shanghai was one of the big films made by welles after returning from relative exile for making citizen kane dark brooding and expressing some early cold war paranoia this film stands tall as a film noir crime film the cinematography of this film is filled with welles characteristic quirks of odd angles quick cuts long pans and sinister lighting the use of ambient street music is a precursor to the incredible long opening shot in touch of evil and the mysterious chinese characters and the sequences in chinatown can only be considered as the inspiration in many ways to roman polanski s chinatown unfortunately it is welles obsession with technical filmmaking that hurts this film in its entirety the plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques however despite this criticism the story combined with wonderful performances by welles hayworth and especially glenn anders laughter make this film a joy to watch orson welles pulls off not only the irish brogue but the torn identities as the honest but dangerous sailor rita hayworth who was married to welles at the time breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and takes on a role of real depth and contradictions finally glenn anders strange and bizarre portrayal or elsa s husbands law partner is nothing short of classic 
orson welles the lady from shanghai does not have the brilliant screenplay of citizen kane e g but charles lawton jr s cinematography the unforgettable set pieces such as the scene in the aquarium the seagoing scene featuring a stunning blonde tressed rita hayworth singing please don t love me and the truly amazing hall of mirrors climax and the wonderful cast everett sloane in his greatest performance welles in a beautifully under played role the afore mentioned miss hayworth welles wife at the time at her most gorgeous make for a very memorable filmgoing experience the bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling not inscrutable at all the viewer is surprised by the twists and turns and welles closing line is an unheralded classic the lady from shanghai gets four stars from this impartial arbiter 
after all you do not go to an orson welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happy ever after star you go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings lighted and scored imaginatively photographed bravely and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place as usual as well as directing welles wrote the script and he also played the hero a young irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil but still retained his clear eyed trust in the goodness of others unfortunately for him he reposed this trust in rita hayworth whose cool good looks concealed a gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the future she was married without love to an impotent crippled advocate acted like a malevolent lizard by the brilliant everett sloane there is a youthful romanticism underlying it all and this quality came into exuberant play in the lady from shanghai before the inevitable happened welles escaped to a final triangular showdown in a hall of mirrors which has become one of the classic scenes of the post war cinema welles did not miss a chance throughout the whole film to counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened the atmosphere his camera seemed almost to caress rita hayworth as the sun played with her hair and her long limbs while she playfully teased the young seaman into her web 
these are excerpts from a nine page memo to mr cohn from mr welles written after orson had seen studio mogul harry cohn s edited version of the picture he took an hour out the preview title music was written by a first rate composer george antheil although not written for our picture at all this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable the only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer heinz roemheld is the rather weary one of using a popular song the theme in as many arrangements as possible throughout we have musical references to please don t kiss me for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material the tune is pleasing it may do very well on the hit parade but lady from shanghai is not a musical comedy mr roemheld is an ardent devotee of an old fashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as disney in other words if somebody falls down he makes a falling down sound in the orchestra etc etc if the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative i couldn t be unhappier about the results just before i left to go abroad i asked vi viola lawrence the editor to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi cab and also quite a bit of dialogue i am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence this was not done accounting for the main weaknesses of the film s opening reel there is nothing in the fact of rita s diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo what does matter is rita s beauty the evil overtones suggested by grigsby s character and michael s bewilderment any or all of these items might have inspired the music instead the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a silly symphony a pratfall by pluto the pup or a wild jump into space by donald duck there is no sound atmosphere on the boat a little wind and water is sorely missed there s no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen at the start of the picnic sequence in the temporary score we used a very curious sexy latin american strain this has been replaced with a corny dramatic sequel bad stock stuff this sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved lady from shanghai from being just another whodunit there is a big musical outburst after grigsby s line i want you to kill him this is absurd the hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point as it stands now it s on about the same level as the rest of the scoring nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we re kidding the aquarium scene needs more echo please don t kiss me is in again a bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of michael s run down the pier from the gunshot through to the phone call a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort for some reason this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo as a result the whole sequence seems dull the audience should feel at this point along with michael that maybe they are going crazy the new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they re going to sleep the gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music the closing music again makes reference to please don t kiss me this finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picture all of these edits from orson were ignored
people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down substantially in post production i have harry as a professor right now at ucsd and honestly its one of the best classes i ve had its rather funny to here about what happened in making the film cause harry is so animated i originally watched joy of life for another class where harry did a voice over in the film and started watching this film after i started the class harry originally did some performance work and is really genuine about creating moments that move you especially when you have to re edit things until you hit on that moment but its something you see in this film 
by hook or by crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers harry dodge and silas howard they manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style and it s beautifully shot by ann t rosetti and wonderfully written truly poetic the lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere this film has so much energy so much poignant passion and scruffy san francisco heart to it i can t recommend it highly enough the best butch buddy movie of all time 
what is so taboo about love people seem to have major problems with the transgenered the title of this movie didn t catch my eye it was a grainy shot about minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing i could not believe how freaking amazing this film was it touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way it is by far one of the best independent films i have ever seen i did not view these characters as either gender just human i would recommend it to anyone who loves movies especially independent films praise to all fearless filmmakers 
this low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places writing and acting in addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far in low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but surprising it rivals film stock for brightness clarity and saturation in brightly lit situations this is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a midnight cowboy kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban san francisco 
for the longest time i liked this movie better than the original care bears movie well last summer i watched them both together and decided i was wrong the first one is a better care bears movie as you may have guessed if you read my review for it this one isn t a bad movie it s just very strange well first of all as a few people have mentioned it completely disavows any knowledge of the first movie i can t think of another sequel that contradicts the original so blatantly especially with the genders of some characters and how they all met when i was little and watching this i was quite a bit confused and distraught i felt the same way watching it as an adult on to the reasons why the movie is actually pretty good if you disassociate it from the first movie i can t think of another movie for little kids with a demon as it s villan now i am not for a minute suggesting that evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and care bears are good i just find it cool that there s a supremely evil being in a movie for little kids it s like that bizzare santa clause vs satan movie from mexico you hear about sometimes anyhow the demon s name is darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the care bears in return for him giving her special powers very dark for a kiddy flick eh and did i mention that darkheart appears to the girl most often as a whiney voiced year old boy freaky meanwhile some other kids are in care a lot looking after baby care bears oh man demons and baby care bears in the same movie needless to say everything gets cleared up in the end but not before we get to see darkheart trap the care bears souls in this scary chandelere thing in one [surprisingly] deeply disturbing scene but i am left with the question of wether this movie has found the cult audience it so richly deserves i might just watch it again myself 
i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me to tell the truth i think that the younger kevin dillon was hot hahahaha but i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his death i was inside you i think that s what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that she s too young when he never cared how old the other girls were now i don t think i myself could ever trust a cop like that but to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either way and that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the store hahahahaha she was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself and so was the cop who died hello it s called back up sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things but that s what i think an thought about the movie 
i searched out this one after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging clueless perhaps alicia silverstone s best known effort from early in her film career true crime has kevin dillon which should be helpful in improving most film projects in fact everyone in the cast does a good job the only disappointment i think the movie has for me is an awkward feel to some of the scenes coming from the need to run a quite uncompromising grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a schoolgirl adventure alicia silverstone is pretty good in this one she carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing unease that affects mary giordano as she manoeuvres towards the truth behind the serial murders i reckon her characterization of mg has some mileage in it too the inference of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law enforcement it could be really interesting for an older silverstone to revisit giordano at a time of crisis later in the officer s life just a thought true crime shows its director in a good light pat verducci also has the writing credit i don t know of any other film work pv has done i can only wonder what happened after such a promising start like most productions this one has a largely unknown supporting cast although bill nunn detective jerry guinn is hardly that over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances i recall seeing him recently in carriers a made for tv presentation with a military theme bill nunn played captain arends fans of the classic us tv comedy show who s the boss may also have an interest in carriers because the leading player is judith light remembered with affection by many because of her lengthy involvement with the show true crime could easily not have worked but it does ok i think it is an entertaining story worth seeing 
i spied this short on a dvd of best new zealand shorts all great but the french doors was amazing it starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen just as you relax into the hum drum of home renovation the most spookiest thing happens eeeekkk i wanted to stop watching but i was glued the films dips into the primal fear of the dark and with little if not any special effects it chills you right to the bone a simple yet brilliant concept opened up all those memories of when i was young and dream t up the most improbably but spooky situations the film makers visual style are bang on and the lead character takes you convincingly through the story it is a quality short that i haven t seen in quite some time the french doors has all the hallmarks of a great feature alas it finishes after ten minutes or so never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more loved it and well done and thanks for the ride these new zealanders are really turning out the talent a new fan 
thanks to this fungal film i do not want my maypo can t stomach the thought of maltex or wheatena and even that granola over there doesn t look so innocent anymore why wasn t the song slop time by the sherrys used as the theme 
as a collector of movie memorabilia i had to buy the movie poster for this film which now that i ve finally seen it has to be the best thing about it there s nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a x inch image of the melting man however there s nothing more awful to put in your vcr than an hour and a half long image of the melting man at first i thought this movie was pure garbage but then i realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh the character of dr ted nelson has to be the most wishy washy persona ever brought to the big screen his dialogue is so trite it s unbelievable it s incredible he seems to be getting stronger as he melts and could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to help him if this movie was meant to scare its audience i think it missed its calling 
i saw this movie in when i was years old at a drive in theater with my family way back then i thought it was very funny even though i was too young to understand of what makes this marvelous movie such a delight i saw it again this morning on turner south as i watched it i was absolutely convulsed with laughter the mating game is a unique classic from a by gone age if you re too young to have experienced the enchanting period in history that produced this film i feel very sorry for you there s no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can even today deliver such a delightful slice of heaven to old timers like me having said that all i can do is respectfully request that younger people refrain from commenting on films like the mating game movies like this were made for the generation that preceded the current group of your people and as such these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand in other words if you don t understand the issues the film is addressing please don t embarrass yourself by offering comments which frankly make no sense 
about a year and a half ago my dad told me about the french doors i thought it sounded interesting enough but i didn t try to find it anywhere then about a year ago i remembered that film and thought hey why not and tried finding it on the internet eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom films i called my dad over to the computer and said to him hey dad i ve found that creepy film you told me about ages ago he smiled at me turned round turned off the lights so it was pitch black apart from the computer screen and told me to watch it i started off fine then when he started getting worried about whatever was there i found it very unnerving at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up it made me jump p if you haven t seen this film i highly recommend you do because it is well worth it even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling great film 
kate beckinsale is as good if not better than gwyneth paltrow as emma in this movie although i really liked gwyneth paltrow in the other emma version they re both good in different ways kate beckinsale as emma seems more interesting almost though and i liked the woman who played harriet smith in this movie better too she was more believably sweet and sentimental there are certain things i like better about the gwyneth paltrow version though like how the humorous side is more apparent 
as winter approaches our state owned broadcaster the abc has decided for some reason to have a partial jane austen festival on sunday nights this commenced with a twelve year old movie length version of emma last sunday more recent versions of three other novels persuasion northanger abbey and mansfield park are to come the curious thing about this production by a e television networks with script by the ever reliable andrew davies is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions one starring gwyneth paltrow and clueless a modernized version starring alicia silverstone which transported the plot to beverly hills perhaps as a result even with kate beckinsale in the lead this production sank without trace as a general rule much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length the adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters an outstanding example is brideshead revisited which had minute episodes back in you only have to compare the very ordinary movie length version of pride and prejudice in with the brilliant six part tv mini series it s not that a novel should be filmed page by page and some novels often not very good ones adapt wonderfully to film atonement is a recent example but novels of the jane austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation this production is ok kate beckinsale gives emma the right mix of self assuredness and vulnerability and mark strong is a forthright mr knightly he reminded me that jane tended to recycle characters knightly is a more articulate version of the moody mr darcy of p p samantha morton was a rather limp harriet but prunella scales got the blabbermouth miss bates perfectly sybil fawlty on speed bernard hepton as emma s feeble father was also excellent we saw the damp countryside the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybody even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places some of the conversations were rather stilted even allowing for the formalities of the times i d have to look at the film again to be sure but it might be due to the under use of reaction shots if you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example and compares well with the paltrow version anyway there is more to come 
the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent production of pride and prejudice so my only gripe here is that emma did not run to or or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice the acting was superb with i think prunella scales excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much the language is a delight to listen to can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word samantha morton was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd 
i really loved this version of emma the best kate beckinsale was awesome as emma and mark strong was very good as knightly the only complaint that i had was on mr woodhouse i can t believe that a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his daughter s life she was a smart girl in the end though as always i love the places in which these jane austin movies were shot the settings are so spectular it makes me want to visit england so much as well as ireland and scotland i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines interwhined with emma s most excellently i am glad that i got to see this one as well 
until the s there had never been a film based upon jane austen s emma then two came along in the same year or if you count s clueless which updates austen s plot to a modern american high school three in two years the main character is emma woodhouse a young lady from a well to do family in regency england she is financially considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband instead her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer robert martin believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton this scheme goes disastrously wrong however as elton has no interest in harriet but has fallen in love with emma herself the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself this being a jane austen plot emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complications today in kate beckinsale is a hollywood star but in despite being only a year younger was not nearly as well known internationally as gwyneth paltrow she is however just as convincing as austen s well intentioned but often wrong headed heroine beckinsale seems to have a gift for classical roles she made a delightful hero in kenneth branagh s version of much ado about nothing and i sometimes find myself wishing that hollywood could have found more suitable roles for her rather than wasting her in turkeys like pearl harbor or underworld i preferred jeremy northam to mark strong as emma s love interest mr knightley largely because he came closer to my own conception of the character as a gentlemanly chivalrous older man in some ways more of a father figure to emma than a lover his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature nineteenth century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry strong tends to downplay the question of the age difference he is she and makes knightley more of a passionate lover and less of a wise mentor than does northam samantha morton another actress who would go on to bigger things is perhaps closer to the harriet of the novel than was toni collette this was the more small scale of the two versions being made for television rather than the cinema and the sets and costumes seem less lavish and there are fewer big names among the cast costume drama however is generally something that british television does well and this version can certainly hold its own with the cinema version both are entertaining and well made versions of austen s novel 
it has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately i don t seem to be able to rent it in the video store only the other version but i fell in love with it i was always borderline with the other emma gwenneth and toni collette as they are not british naturally have to put on the accent and well to me it doesn t seem natural it seems put on sorry but don t think toni and gwenneth did a brilliant job there i could not warm to any of the characters but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person i imagined emma to be it is definitely the version i will come back to from now on i was disappointed that mr knightley was not better looking but he is convincing i also like jane fairfax better played by olivia williams i never warmed to her in the movie version but she is better portrayed in this version come to think of it besides mr knightley all characters are better played and a lot less over the top unfortunately both came out around same time and the paltrow version got more publicity pity i also love the new scene at the end well done to kate beckingsale therefore if you are a jane austen fan don t forget to watch this one 
i ve really enjoyed this adaptation of emma i have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again though it only lasts minutes most of the novel plot and sub plots were developed in a satisfactory way all the characters are well portrayed most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in emma thompson s sense and sensibility as a foreigner i particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors the setting and costumes were beautiful i find this version quite on a par with the miniseries pride and prejudice but then the producer and screenwriter were the same kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying emma of whom jane austen said she would create a heroin no one but her would love she is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley not an easy part i think though he has not the charisma shown by colin firth s mr darcy in pride and prejudice even the end scene the harvest festival which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity had she been in his situation a strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from jane austen s novels 
this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular pride and prejudice emma is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austen s novel especially considering its short length the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emma s character in the rest of the book i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well picked kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrow s version samantha morton s wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book mister knightly s role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much neglected sumptuous film 
i ve seen this movie after watching paltrow s version i ve found that one a very good one and i thought this would not be as good but i was wrong british version was far better and enjoyable i found jeremy northam more agreeable than mark strong but i can say that strong catches much better austen s knightley anyway both versions are good but anyone that loved austen s books should watch this movie i agree with caalling andrew davies changed a few things but still remains faithful to the original out of my cents 
this is a better adaptation of the book than the one with paltrow although i liked that one too it isn t so much that beckinsale is better they are both very good but that the screenplay is better davies is a master at adapting austen for filming and the production values here are very good it s not quite as glossy as the hollywood treatment but it s close and i thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better 
jane austen s emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen kake beckinsale s emma is irreproachable gwyneth paltrow with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography is able to bring out the comedy effectively she fails to make emma likeable paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply wrong for the part and i believe the era and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses kate beckinsale on the other hand manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly the most romantic of jane austen s heroes actually sees in her mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks an appropriate age chivalry compassion and gentlemanly behaviour emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful 
this is a excellent start to the film career of mickey rooney his talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him the car and truck chase is exciting for the era this start of the andy hardy series is an american treasure in my book spring byington performance is excellent as usual please mr rooney or owners of the film rights take a chance and get this produced on dvd i think it would be a winner 
seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy vietnam veteran trampa infernal is a pretty entertaining mexican slasher that reminds me a lot the zero boys the film is fast paced and there are some good death scenes like throat slashing or axe in the neck unfortunately there is not much gore so fans of grand guignol will be disappointed however if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look mexican horror flicks are quite obscure i have seen only alucarda and don t panic so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher my rating out of highly recommended 
they filmed this movie out on long island where i grew up my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer which they told me was colored water tasted disgusting and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again especially in the funnel scenes yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form it never came out in the theaters obviously and it as far as i knew was never released on video and i m sure wasn t released on dvd yet it looks like it was seen by some people albeit it probably very few so there must be something i would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother yet there is no way i can find it anywhere does anybody know anything about when where how this movie could be purchased and which format that would be 
i searched for this movie for years apparently it ain t available here in the states so bought me a copy off ebay four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers what they find is an ex vietnam vet gone crazy he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la freddy krueger as soon as the night falls one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend she gets killed after one of the group finds her body they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight once the sun comes up all of them try and make it out but fall victim one by one seven bodies not a lot of gore but a couple of good murders especially the girls deaths the guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways blown up in car shot to death knife through head overall infernal trap is a nice slasher film from the late s nothing new just well acted fast paced and some pretty ladies out of 
talk about a blast opening trampa infernal has the coolest opening credits ever guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary friday the th theme tsh tsh tsh ha ha ha the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables promising intro of a totally obscure mexican slasher backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes two extremely competitive and testosterone overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar according to a newspaper article there s a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it the challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls upon arrival however it quickly becomes obvious they re not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve after a whole decade of tame and derivative american slashers this early s mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid the formula is simplistic but efficient the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful the maniac must have been a fan of freddy krueger and michael myers as he also uses a self made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face the murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric which i was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood the forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular trampa internal is a mexican slasher survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre 
i think it s one of the greatest movies which are ever made and i ve seen many the book is better but it s still a very good movie 
can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal which was to correctly adapt allende s novel obviously yes bille august managed to make a superficial shallow film where basic elements of south american mentality are presented simply as side events resulting in total incoherency i can t believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book there is of course technical quality in this film and i think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands but something is missing and this something was the most important part 
perhaps the best isabel allende s book house of the spirits describes an alternative chilean history this one full of magic a mystic veil plus some kind of omnipresent sadness this movie gathers a great cast plus a great art direction with a script that cannot contain all this book s quality it s unusual for a nearly unknown country like chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset mostly because they understood very little 
well i said it all in the summary i simpley adore the movie and the cast i would give each actor an oscar great great movie i m now and i watched it times in different periods and i always think i won t cry and i always do about or times meryl s was absolutely brilliant jeremy irons also just brilliant i wish the movie received more awards i really don t know anybody who watched it and didn t loved it also glenn close was fantastic the story was beautiful and sad at the same time i loved the fact that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much and how blanca was close to her parents 
at first i didn t didn t like it that much although i did they didn t include the third trueba generation the love between blanca and pedro wans t well explained and some actors were too different from what i had imagined later i realized that had the movie been more loyal to the book it would have been like five hours long and would be kind of tedious now i like it very much because my favourite characters are there as i portraited them clara really looks like an angel in live and her introduction to the story at the beggining of the film was fantastic loyal and short glenn close is ferula i pictured her just like that only not in mourning throughout the whole thing esteban is find enough i never really liked his character and although i was interested in him i hated him a lot more specially when he hit clara as in the book the very last part is the most exciting one and it has real history too there the movie is really good specially considering that it was a gringo film based upon a latin american book its amazing how many famous stars are there don t you think so 
brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of chilean president salvador allende killed in the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart esteban trueba and his undeserved family the brilliant danish director bille august recreates in micro which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened chilean nation and whose main character would augusto pinochet stephen similarities with it are inevitable recall as an example that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace bille august attends an exceptional cast in the jeremy protruding irons whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change in esteban fully applies the law of resonance with great wisdom solomon describes in these words the things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you unforgettable glenn close playing splint the tainted sister of stephen whose sin driven by loneliness spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother meryl streep also brilliant a woman whose name came to him like a glove clara with telekinetic powers cognitive and mediumistic this hardened woman loyal to his blunt conservative husband is an indicator of character and self control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings every character is a portrait of virtuosity as blanca worthy rebel leader pedro segundo unhappy or a portrait of humiliation like stephen jr the bastard child of senator who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang the film moves the bowels we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated but that absurdly still happen colombia is a sad example and another reminder that against all life is wonderful because there are always people like isabel allende and immortalize just bille august 
i liked the movie first of all because it told an interesting story but the story as told in the movie felt like it was condensed from a much longer story since the book is over pages that makes sense it spans a time period from the s to the s in a fictional south american country also a lot to fit into the time available i think it would have been much better as a six hour mini series than it turned out as a minute movie even though it s rushed the story doesn t skip so much that it gets confusing what is told is told fairly well one fault is that clara s supernatural powers appear inconsistently either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie or they should have been left out two more faults which could be spoilers esteban s eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly and ferula s curse seems to wear off even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure forever the acting is excellent glenn close as the tormented spinster ferula is outstanding jeremy irons as the brutal self made rich man is also excellent meryl streep as the main character clara is great although she s often even better than she was in this movie there were many well performed smaller roles too the biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent 
the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue south american politics and super natural powers meryl streep glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel allende s novel to life with all its passion and suspense this in my view is one of the best films of the s jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle loving warmth throughout her relatively short life winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture glenn close as esteban s sister gives a very moving performance the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non tropical latin american country settings of clara s home and esteban s ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the post war atmosphere 
hotel du nord is a gripping drama of guilt in which marcel carne portrayed an entertaining tale of ill fated love which also functions as a revolt against the cruel world the film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers pierre and renee were mistaken when they believed that suicide would put an end to their misery hotel du nord has its own inimitable charm as its inhabitants have become an essential part of the establishment there is an element of togetherness as everyone flocks to hotel du nord to eat chat etc marcel carne has remained true to the spirit of the films produced in s and s as hotel du nord has a certain kind of nostalgic feel carne while recreating the life of parisian roads was able to create a sort of nostalgia for black and white giving a unique genre of poetic realism to his oeuvre hotel du nord can be termed as a quintessence of cinematographic populism the th july ball scene on the banks of saint martin canal remains a magnificent sequence the film s immense popularity can be judged from the fact that hotel du nord has been declared as a national monument 
a true classic beautifully filmed and acted reveals an area of paris which is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy although the area of hotel du nord and the hotel itself still exists it is not as gay in the original sense of the word and joyful as it once must have been the film makes one yearn for the past which has been lost with a sigh and bittersweetness 
i love this movie jouvet arletty blier carn almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail i d like to shed some light onto no footage of the real still standing h tel du nord is it still i heard it was to be demolished has been used for the movie the whole scene has been rebuilt on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks 
this is an excellent film and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings as it is unavailable on video dvd the way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving and ends with them leaving although quite a lot happens in between and they don t stay in one place during this time gives you a sense of closure and a feeling that all is right with the world if you get a chance to see this film then do i can t wait to see it again and wish that it could be put on general release 
i suppose i always felt that hotel du nord was studio bound the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location but no problem it s still a much underrated lovely composition from marcel carne the plot seems a bit choppy at times as if they were making it up as they went along but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end the money shots when the lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue but it s all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted are these young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre war france or simply idiots suicide pacts are fairly common if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools arletty played the part of prostitute well she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway i ve only seen a few films with jouvet he is the most impressive invention as pimp in hdn my trouble is shallow every time i see his face i think of sonnie hale in evergreen a remarkably atmospheric well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place annabella and aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple francois heurtebise perier in his nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man all in all wonderful 
 hotel du nord is the only carn movie from the era which has dialogs not written by jacques pr vert but by henri jeanson janson was much more interested in the jouvet arletty couple than in the pair of lovers annabella aumont the latter is rather bland and their story recalls oddly the edith piaf s song les amants d un jour except that the chanteuse s tale is a tragic one what s fascinating today is this popular little world the canal saint martin settings this movie is dear to the french movies buffs for another very special reason the pimp jouvet tells his prot g e raymonde he wants a change of air atmosph re because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosph re the whore raymonde wonderful arletty thinks it s an insult and she delivers this line that is undeniably the most famous of the whole french cin ma in french atmosph re atmosph re est ce que j ai une gueule d atmosph re translation attempt atmosphere atmosphere have i got an atmosphere face this is our french nobody s perfect 
this version of anna christie is in german greta garbo again plays anna christie but all of the other characters have different actors from the english version both were filmed back to back because garbo had such a following in germany garbo herself supposedly favored her anna christie in this version over the english version it s a good tale and a must see for garbo fans 
i can t remember many films where a bumbling idiot of a hero was so funny throughout leslie cheung is such the antithesis of a hero that he s too dense to be seduced by a gorgeous vampire i had the good luck to see it on a big screen and to find a video to watch again and again 
this is a great movie i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink and the skeletons chase him but luckily he dodged them opened the window and didn t even notice them xiao qian is very pretty too when he stuck the needle up ma wu s butt its hysterical and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too then also the part where he eats his buns while watching thew guy kill many people then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves the love scenes are romantic xiao qian and ning look cute together add the comic timing the giant tongue and u have horror romance comedy all at once not to mention superb special effects for the s 
wasn t quite sure what to expect with this one outside of the uniform positive reviews i ve read turns out i could have never imagined this movie because it s very close to the bride with white hair in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic this walks a fine line between being a farce a comedy and just plain good old fashion ghost story telling there s nothing scary about it that s not the theme it s really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts so the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost this also takes place in ancient china with wild outlandish kung fu exhibitions and a trip to hell more or less some of the stop action ghosts are pretty cool and the visual effects are top rate all the way i could watch this genre of chinese movies all day because they are highly entertaining great visuals and pretty much tongue in cheek and i m looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also highly recommended 
if there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it so bad it wasn t intended to be that way but superb anyway go find it somewhere whatever you do do not miss it 
there s never a dull moment in this movie wonderful visuals good actors and a classical story of the fight of good and evil mostly very funny sometimes even scary a true classic a movie everybody should see 
after seeing this film for the rd time now i think it is almost adam s worst film punch drunk love is poor in comparison to this i must say at the end when dickie gets thrown of the boat it is so funny the hair is different to his and i like it when he flips everyone off this film should only be brought if your a true adam sandler fan the characters are poor in comparison to his funny films like the waterboy which has the same people in it peter dante who is one of the assassins trying to kill the australian bird this film lack depth and a decent story line and deserves to be in the bottom 
just read the original story which is written by pu in th century strikingly the movie despict the original spirit very well though the plot was modified tremendously the film language the rhythm the special effect are all from hollywood but still there is a chinese core it is amazing how hark tsui managed to combine them together the result is pure beauty 
cannot believe a movie that can be made that good in and is virtually unknown in the west not to repeat other reviews here the score is very good and moving literally it means dawn please never comes when it comes the beautiful ghost and the lover will be apart forever after years joel and leslie still look great i enjoyed joel in god of gamblers and many movies by leslie including better tomorrow 
for long time i haven t seen such a good fantasy movie magic fights here are even better than in lotr even considering that it s a movie and haven t computer special effects this movie have good plot good acting and interesting ideas recommend everybody to see it 
there are comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action to the humour and even to the beautiful music score i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk i will certainly be adding it to my collection 
ching siu tung s and tsui hark s a chinese ghost story aside from being one of the greatest wuxia pian films ever made is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an impressively choreographed martial arts film that should belong in every film lover s collection the sorely missed hong kong superstar leslie cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends the night at a haunted temple while staying at the temple he meets a colorful cast of characters that include the swordsmen yin wu ma and hsiao hou the tree devil and the beautiful ghost lit sin seen played by the lovely joey wong to free her from the clutches of the evil tree devil he must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon enough good things can t be said about this film the pacing is perfect with a great combination of romance action fantasy and humor and the feverishly paced finale should leave you with little chance to breathe the chemistry between the wonderfully tragic joey wong and leslie cheung whose legendary career ended much too soon really allows the viewer to feel for both of them indeed the acting on the whole is so vivacious and full of life i would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences i ve ever had much of the credit goes to wu ma in his portrayal of the mysterious swordsman yin his over the top persona of a disillusioned swordsman hell bent on vanquishing evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional hk drama a wonderful score lush cinematography with eye popping colors and frenetic action pieces courtesy of ching siu tung round out this wonderful film find a copy anywhere you can 
i like the good and evil battle i liked eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done he wasn t the smart cocky know it all he usually plays he shows heart and a more humble humor the fact that it shows there are stranger things in heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope 
this movie is one of my favourites it is a genre mixture with ingredients of the action horror romantic comedygenre some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards this minor flaw is easily ignored there is so much to discover in this story the romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts the visuals are beautiful too the action is great which is no surprise it is originating from honkong birthplace of the world s best action movies the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good absolutely recommended 
this is the best chinese movie i have ever seen and in my opinion a lot better than hero or chrouching tiger hidden dragon the movie is a unique combination of several genres it s a beautiful love story action movie comedy and horror at the same time and the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this this movie definitely makes it to my top and should be enjoyable to every movie lover the action sequences do have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying but the way it s shot differs from the style of hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense ghosts can fly see this movie you won t regret it 
this movie is incredible with great characters specially the old swordsman that can fly in the shape of fireball and jump across the trees this film tells a classic story of battle between good and forces of evil the final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda cool very very recommendable not for the smallest children though this one deserves a 
very funny film classic film funny eddie murphy of the s i saw when i was a child and i have a good memory the classic irony of murphy does not fail the film is funny well done murphy in the s made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous the result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from up to now have changed the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period a nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic murphy an actor who has recently disappeared the final part is anthologies the likable actor who plays the part of the tibetan monk that s it 
being someone who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time and at the same time loving this student film parody i feel i must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing reviews this short but sweet opus has always been a crowd pleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously this film is a tribute to the original not an insult it is intended to be funny and many others who i have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds especially for those of us who have seen notld times watch for the director cameo as news reporter jeff drexel and also if you have the opportunity catch his alien parody loaf 
having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons i believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its reference though the themes are crusty and stale to today s viewers it is by no means a crumby waste of time though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no dough as noted by another reviewer it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy sit back and loaf idly through the film i think this short bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it 
does anyone happen to know where this film was shot the aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful it appears to be england however ivy s apartment building certainly looks like the brill building with its fascinating elevators charles mendl is listed as playing sir charles gage maybe i blinked but i never saw him perhaps he was the husband s lawyer but again i don t recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call perhaps he was in the aviation scene or the ballroom scene did anyone spot him herbert marshall was years old when he shot this film 
warning contains a spoiler corny plot and in many cases terrible acting fontaine is great but some others particularly richard ney ivy s husband are exceedingly wooden ney lies in bed dying of arsenical poisoning with every hair in place yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful more faithful to the book than most movies of its era casting joan fontaine as a poisoner and an adulteress which was just as shocking then i m not kidding kids was a masterful stroke she s just her usual joan fontainey self as murderers were supposed to she dies by falling feet foremost through the floor into an empty space 
joan fontaine stars as the villain in this victorian era film she convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover on the side and also sets her sights on a wealthy man miles rushworth who is played by herbert marshall mr marshall is quite good as miles miss fontaine acted her part to perfection she was at the same time cunning calculating innocent looking frightened and charming it takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off joan fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes by travis banton also in the film is joan s mother lillian fontaine as lady flora i highly recommend this film 
loved joan great performance what isn t she good in i watched this film and then jane eyre right after she just keeps getting better my heart was racing great old movie drama just what i want from a classic movie facial expressions are worth the whole film i m glad i have it on video don t know what more you need in a film beautiful woman wealth greed murder detectives a trial the costumes are very nice makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie wish they still made films like this whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie films in black and white still hold a certain mystery 
although lang s version is more famous borzage s work is not devoid of interest far from it its celestial sequences are even better the metaphor of the train perhaps borrowed from the ending of abel gance s la roue is eventually more convincing than the up above heavenly world borzage s tenderness for his characters shows in marie s character and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects the ending of three comrades the amusement park seems to be everywhere we see it even when we are in marie s poor house i do not think that the sets are that much cheesy they are stylized to a fault the fair from a distance almost gives a sci fi feel to the movie borzage never forgets his social concerns in the heavenly train going up the rich cannot stand to be mixed up with the riffraff but as chief magistrate tells here there s no more difference not a major work for borzage neither is lang s version but to seek out if you are interested in the great director s career 
the sea is watching has been made from an original akira kurosawa script and it is indeed a lush and warm film watching it will be a pleasure kei kumai as director is certainly no equal to the old but everlasting master particularly the mass scenes in the beginning of the film has some terrible acting but the overall mood and scenery is very enjoyable another thing that is missed here kurosawa always managed to let the characters be so much more then what they are actually showing and doing probably that was his magic on set while shooting and just maybe this script was not fully up to par yet maybe we just miss the eye of the master this is one lovely and sweet film but it is no kurosawa to expect that might well be very silly 
kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any shakespearean drama and the acting is true to the story with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale it is touching funny and intriguing in all parts the character development is near perfect the cinematography is vivid and engaging and the story draws you in i would like to say that the samurai freaks and those obsessed with late th and th century dynastic tales of japan may snub this film as not kurosawa s best work perhaps not his best but even at his worst kurosawa is better than many of the best this story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change that it is timeless despite being set in the not so distant past i would heartily recommend this to any movie buff and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based 
this is a very fine and poetic story beautiful scenery magnificent music score i ve been twice in japan last year and the movie gave me this typical japanese feeling the movement of the camera is superb as well as the actors it goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it s all very well brought onto the screen here the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details once you ve seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director it s a real feel good movie and i can only recommend it to everybody 
this is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village that could be best described with scene constellations and direction of old kurosawa s works combined with dostoyevski s topics of human psychology o shin sonia marmeladova shakespeare s drama and hans christian andersen s tragic and cheerfulness the screenplay is wondrous the scenes are colour and beautiful some scenes stay really imprinted in my mind the plot is interesting and unpredictable each of the characters is very well developed and interesting there is also a little action so if you don t like all the sentiments you d also come to your costs it is not about mysterious geishas and proud samurai with their bushido pouring all out of them but about life work and kinds of people found everywhere at any time a lovely and fascinating tribute to kurosawa certainly worth seeing 
it helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place first of all these ladies are not geisha they are oiran prostitutes in the yoshiwara type green houses circa give or take this should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware the film deals with issues of loyalty love and perhaps most importantly how people deal with adversity both their own and that of others in their immediate environment that plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music make for a lovely ride just plug it in suspend your disbelief and enter their world you won t be disappointed 
this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions muti billion dollar computer graphics or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie all you need is a excellent story line and plot which the master of all japanese films akira kurosawa pulls off brilliantly i recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece and for those that enjoy kurosawas earlier works 
i grew up watching this movie and i still love it just as much today as when i was a kid don t listen to the critic reviews they are not accurate on this film eddie murphy really shines in his roll you can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it i recommend this movie to everybody to see it is a comedy with a touch of fantasy with demons dragons and a little bald kid with god like powers this movie takes you from l a to tibet of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in tibet just a beautiful view so go do your self a favor and snatch this one up you wont regret it 
 umi wa miteita the sea is watching was akira kurasawa s swansong to film his adaptation of his favored novelist shugoro yamamoto s story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career director kei kumai pays homage to both kurosawa and yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image set in th century japan the story explores the lives of the women of a geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men the house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha oshin nagiko tono supports her family who live in a neighboring village kikuno misa shimizu has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste oshin befriends an endangered samurai falls in love with the gentle fellow only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with oshin to marry his promised betrothed oshin s heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically monetarily by kikuno and the other geishas a handsome samurai ryosuke masatoshi nagase enters oshin s life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her kikuno is beset by problems deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her and coping with a rich but abusive customer all the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street oshin and kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by ryosuke the manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice love and devotion the sea is watching and will find protection for true love the photography by kazuo okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent the acting is a bit strained for edo art but the characters are well created and keep the story credible the one distraction which is definitely not something kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track but in the end there is enough of kurosawa s influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema grady harp
a tragically wonderful movie brings us to a japan that does not exist anymore despite hollywood s technical expertise i have yet to see a hollywood movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea tom cruise s the last samurai looked liked the last installment of the lord of the rings in trying to capture rural old japan if you like serene but intense story lines this is a must see film it will be a respite from hollow flashy films much like the last blockbusters you saw i think this is one of kurosawa s better stories even if it s a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such settings it did not turn into a skin flick the characters are full of depth and act with much intensity 
a wonderful film to watch with astonishing scenes and talented actors such as misa shimizu and nagiko tono after minutes of watching your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting what the destiny will bring to the characters this film makes you leave your position as a standard audience it takes you in it makes you a part of the story costumes and settings are brilliant especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built it is definitely not very akira kurosawa however it still gets a lot from the master especially the stylistic story telling tells us we re in a distinguished land of cinema which is quite far from hollywoodish flamboyance 
i can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge first of all those girls are not geisha but brothel tenants and one that don t know the difference will not understand half of the movie and certainly not the end this is a complete art work about the women s life and needs in this era everything is important and certainly the way they dress all over the movie means more than words to those who thought it was a boring geisha movie i ll suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality this is kurosawa s work of is life and i m sure that the director understood the silent meaning of kurosawa s piece to the right intellectual range 
contrary to some people s summaries the women depicted in the film are not geisha they are oiran prostitutes living outside the most famous pleasure districts and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women i can t say the stories were particularly enlightening but their charm lies in just how typical they are the themes are universal and everyday love friendship and sacrifice i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse the actors especially the women who played the main oiran were a thrill to watch i d only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories it s a great example of both 
i really liked this movie and went back to see it two times more within a week ms detmers nailed the performance she was like a hungry cat on the prowl toying with her prey she lashes out in rage and lust taking a too young lover and crashing hundreds of her terrorist fianc s mother s pieces of fine china to the floor the film was full of beautiful touches the maserati the wonderful wardrobe the flower boxes along the rooftops i particularly enjoyed the ancient greek class and the recitation of antigone it had a feeling of story of o that is where people of means indulge in unrestrained sexual adventure as she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff she is at ease and why not what is to restrain a devil in the flesh the whole movie is a real treat 
the movie is far more sophisticated and intelligent is its exploration of sexual tension than such american attempts as and a half weeks the courtroom scene itself with the couple copulating in the cage while the heroine pleads for their orgasm is amazing i have not seen this movie in years but it made indelible pictures in my mind it is rich in texture and successful in creating a world where sex is the engine for all activity and at its bottom is the yawning angst that lives in us all the plot is european and it meanders a bit but so does life especially when you are and have a constant hard on 
i m surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film the lion s share of the footage in both is identical but here is where they differ in one version the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the brotherhood of the protectors a fictional splinter group of priests and brothers excommunicated by the church in the other version which i ve seen only once on tv the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official church meaning the archdiocese of new york or perhaps brooklyn also in the former version in most of the pertinent scenes the clerics are referred to as brothers and in some scenes you can see where the lips say father so and so but the dubbed audio says brother so and so in the latter version i believe everyone is referred to as father in any event it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re shooting of the other with all brotherhood of the protector scenes re shot as archdiocese scenes or vice versa kind of reminds me of the raymond burr cutaway scenes in godzilla i have videotaped both versions off broadcast tv so no i m not imagining this can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film 
wonderful film one of the best horror films of the s she is realistic settings and atmospheres as usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments i have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even sufficiency obviously because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati is like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics here before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment in the film a good gift because is really well done raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of kubrick films he really impression excellent film really i consider a film anthology of years 
i had the tv on for a white noise companion and heard for a fully furnished apartment so i ran into the tv room expecting another s flick and got much more luckily i could rewind to the beginning dvr buffer and hit the record button to watch it entirely cinemax uncut and in hd no less aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog events this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch pretty creepy and progressive at times beverly d angelo s character masturbates in front of alison parker played adroitly by cristina raines parker stabs in very gory fashion her father an explicit menage a trios scene don t let the kids watch the film is totally s full of bad clothes polyester suits and tacky ascots and decor bad hair over bloated music score and familiar looking cinematography the cast is excellent take a second on this film s home page to check it out it was a surprise to see christopher walken jerry orbach and jeff goldblum so young sylvia miles always wonderfully creepy enjoy 
ahh yes the all star blockbuster take a so so concept stuff it into a script and load it down with every single freakin special effect that the wizards of hollyweird can conjure up then round up the usual suspects hot up and comers has beens wanna be s and never wuzzes and stick em all in ensemble roles of various sizes in front of the unforgiving eye of the cameras and hope to gawd that some of them aren t too old to remember their lines leave it to the bishops of box office to apply the concept to horror films at last as was the case with the post exorcist thriller the sentinel novelist jeffrey konvitz decided to try and one up ira levin s rosemary s baby scenario of creepy and ultimately satanic neighbors in a new york brownstone the result was a controversial best seller that some claimed bordered on the plagiaristic and an equally controversial top heavy star laden vehicle co written and directed by death wish s michael winner but for many unsettlingly different reasons cristina raines nashville plays successful model alison parker who is pretty much over stressed and over worked i won t add overpaid i mean she is a model so that would be redundant not just by her schedule by also by her insistent wanna get married right now boyfriend michael chris sarandon of dog day afternoon and the classic sob i g movie lipstick one of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place a big beautiful brownstone in manhattan which she s able to get dirt cheap that should ve been the big red flag cheap real estate in new york from the mysteriously accommodating broker miss logan golden age screen vet ava gardner fresh from the storm drain in earthquake things seem fine at first but ah yes then comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night and what about the really strange neighbors like gerde sylvia miles and sandra a very early beverly d angelo the nice single friends read lesbians living together and kindly old mr charles chazen a nicely creepy burgess meredith who seems maybe a little too concerned with alison s welfare and that s not to mention other assorted squirrelly cohabitants you ll never hear the phrase black and white cat black and white cake again without wanting to laugh milk through your nose and possibly vomit simultaneously especially the old blind priest living in the penthouse things really start to go downhill when an apparition laden nightmare of alison s morphs into a grisly murder in one of the movie s most underwear staining scares and both alison and michael with some assistance from alison s bff jennifer deborah raffin begin to piece together the puzzle that reveals the brownstone s dark origins as well as the murderous agenda of its other worldly inhabitants not to mention alison s connection to them which as it turns out is anything but coincidental although there s nothing controversial about the overstuffed cast which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time arthur kennedy jose ferrer martin balsam eli wallach john carradine and even early appearances by christopher walken jeff goldblum and nana visitor winner and company went back to bombastic basics and pulled a tod browning by enlisting real life physically challenged actors to appear in the sentinel s climactic everything and everybody goes to hell sequence which i guess any ballsy director would do finding himself unable to access linda blair and a case of green pea soup it does definitely leave you with arctic fingers playing your spinal cord like a zither knowing this juicy little tidbit of info as you watch and it does feature a technique to which filmmakers have only begun to return very recently live on set makeup and special effects that don t involve cgi which was pretty much non existent back then the sentinel has that kitschy late seventies cheese factor but does manage to distinguish itself from time to time with some gasp inducing moments like the one mentioned above not to mention that queasy feeling of dread that horror writers find it easy to play upon of isolation and things that go bump and shriek in the night after all what living single in the big city person hasn t lain in bed in the dark and listened intently to the sounds of what they hope is the building settling konvitz followed up the sentinel with an inevitable sequel the guardian not to be confused with the william friedkin supernatural thriller namesake that was never adapted for the screen sigh of relief 
michael winner is probably best known for his revenge themed films such as death wish and chato s land but he is equally gifted as a director of occult horror cinema as the sentinel of proves the sentinel which is based on a novel by john konvitz who also wrote the screenplay is a clever and immensely creepy religious chiller that no lover of occult horror should consider missing the film is obviously inspired by successful occult classics such as rosemary s baby the exorcist or the omen but as far as i am concerned it is also easily as unsettling as these more widely acclaimed films and probably even creepier allison parker christina raines is a beautiful young new york model traumatized by events in her her past and not yet willing to marry her lawyer boyfriend chris sarandon allison is in search for an apartment and finds a big incredibly nice one which is also affordable in an old mansion in brooklyn the new apartment however comes along with a bunch of very strange other tenants and the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to alice this may not be an adequate plot synopsis but i would hate to spoil any of this film s great moments so i will not give any further plot description what i will say however is that the sentinel is a very creepy and effective film that profits from a great cast as well as an often bizarre and constantly uncanny atmosphere the fact that director michael winner and writer john konnvitz also acted as producers here certainly had its influence on the outcome the film is imaginatively photographed and the eerie old brooklyn mansion is a fantastic setting for this kind of film as mentioned above the atmosphere is obscure and creepy and the film also includes several shock moments and genuine scares the film features many sinister and eccentric characters and the cast is superb beautiful christina raines is great in her role of allison parker lovable and yet on the cusp to losing her mind chris sarandon is also very good as her boyfriend a successful lawyer and the supporting cast includes many big names such as christopher walken jeff goldblum jerry orbach beverly d angelo and tom berenger before becoming really famous the cast also includes stars like ava gardner horror icon john carradine burgess meredith and my personal favorite the great eli wallach as a cynical homicide detective i ve been a great fan of director michael winner for a long time mostly for films like death wish and chato s land the sentinel is yet another great film in winner s repertoire and also the proof that the man is not only a master of hard boiled revenge cinema but also of atmospheric occult horror all in all the sentinel is a creepy intelligent and amazingly bizarre occult chiller that is highly recommended to all horror fans 
director writer michael winner s feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film although still schlock efficiently catered for which really does by go unnoticed sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material of good vs evil and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive if somewhat exploitative set pieces as a whole it s sketchy however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang busters with the scares actually there s always something going on amongst its busy framework but it s rather down played with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation winner s dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian however it s the ensemble cast that really holds it together as you try to spot the faces there s plenty too some having more to do with the scheme of things than others but there s no doubts every one of them are committed despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all it s interesting to see names like sylvia miles who s significantly creepy beverly d angelo likewise deborah raffin eli wallach christopher walken william hickey a neat cameo jeff goldblum jerry orbach and tom berenger in bit parts then you got a mild mannered chris sarandon and movingly gorgeous cristina raines in the leads offering able support jos ferrer martin balsam ava gardner john carradine burgess meredith and arthur kennedy the script does throw around many characters as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in however it s disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what s really going on here is there a reason for all of this and why is it surrounding raines character the emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange worrying experiences she encounters when she s moves into her new apartment this is where winner tries to pull out the eerie shades which projects some icy moments gil melle was the man responsible for the grand overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and richard c kratina instruments the sweeping scope like photography 
i m not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity as despite some rather silly goings on the sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money michael winner has admitted many times that he s not the best director of all time and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film but it has to be said that the film works in spite of it s uninspired direction and the fact that winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it the plot is rich with mystery and begins by focusing on alison parker and her hunt for a flat she finds that she can t afford most properties she looks at but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully furnished apartment for an affordable price her problems start soon after moving in as she doesn t like her neighbours very much and this problem increases when the property broker tells her that she has just one neighbour an elderly blind priest on the top floor the cast list is truly superb with the relatively unknown cristina raines heading up a great support cast chris sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite raines but small parts for the likes of john carradine eli wallach ava gardner jeff goldblum and christopher walken to name but a handful more than make up for sarandon s lifeless portrayal michael winner does a good job with his central location as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story the film is a little slow to start but it s never boring and michael winner s screenplay provides a surprise that s almost impossible to guess from the offset which certainly deserves some praise like many similar slow burning horrors this one doesn t go for the money shot early on but unlike many the ending is a definite climax as winner goes all out to shock the viewer and if the rumour that he used actual human oddities is true i ve got to say that he does a very good job at it overall while this film may be pure hokum whichever way you look at it the sentinel is one of the better films of its type and it s definitely a major highlight for its director 
boasting an all star cast so impressive that it almost seems like the mad mad mad mad world of horror pictures the sentinel is nevertheless an effectively creepy film centering on the relatively unknown actress cristina raines in this one she plays a fashion model alison parker who moves into a brooklyn heights brownstone that is and i don t think i m giving away too much at this late date very close to the gateway of hell and as a tenant in this building she suffers far worse conditions than leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug to put it mildly indeed the scene in which alison encounters her noisy upstairs neighbor is truly terrifying and should certainly send the ice water coursing down the spines of most viewers despite many critics complaints regarding raines acting ability i thought she was just fine more than ably holding her own in scenes with ava gardner burgess meredith arthur kennedy chris sarandon and eli wallach the picture builds to an effectively eerie conclusion and although some plot points go unexplained i was left feeling more than satisfied as the book dvd delirium puts it any movie with beverly d angelo and sylvia miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards can t be all bad on a side note yesterday i walked over to montague terrace in brooklyn heights to take a look at the sentinel house yes it s still there and although shorn of its heavy coat of ivy and lacking a blind priest nun at the top floor window looks much the same as it did in this picture if this house really does sit atop the entrance to hell i take it that hell is the brooklyn queens expressway but we new yorkers have known that for some time 
i was an usherette in an old theater in northern california when this movie came out as good as it is on dvd it s even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen although it has been about years since i have seen it it is still one of my all time favorites at the risk of sounding trite they just don t make em like this anymore if sixth sense freaked you out at all this movie is definitely for you great storyline incredible cast of characters ominous setting even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it i highly recommend you not watch it alone what a brownstone apartment was renting for in alone will have you gasping it would be at least times that price today 
a young woman who is a successful model and is also engaged to be married and who has twice attempted suicide in the past is chosen by a secretive and distant association of catholic priests to be the next sentinel to the gateway to hell which apparently goes through a creepy old but well maintained brooklyn apartment building its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves but apparently can t escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way the previous one john carradine is about dead so she by fate or whatever becomes the next one and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free lots of interesting details lie under the surface her relationship with her father the stories of the doomed her fianc so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror but given the sets the great cast and overall level of bizarreness this is definitely worth seeing 
sigh i sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director michael winner surely he isn t the avatar of subtlety as his films are practically always hard handed and confronting but so what they re awesomely entertaining his most famous action movies like the first three entries in the death wish series for example are easy targets to clobber down because they allegedly glorify violence and the personal use of shotguns but even when winner takes on far more mature cinema genres like the religious horrors of the sentinel for example he doesn t stand a chance with any of the critics the sentinel generated some controversy and infuriated several people upon its release when it leaked that michael winner cast genuinely malformed and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the gateways between hell and earth pretty much the exact same controversy caused todd s browning s masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema freaks to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years and why just because certain prudish and easily offended people who shouldn t watch the movie in the first place claim it s an unethical thing to do i don t suppose michael winner or todd browning held these people at gunpoint or forced them to appear in their films so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place another major reason why critics didn t warmly welcome the sentinel is because jeffrey konvitz novel and thus michael winner s screenplay is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus according to the merciless pens of horror critics little more than pure plagiarism admittedly the sentinel borrows multiple substantial elements from rosemary s baby the omen and the exorcist but let s face it s cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories if you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and in all fairness a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots the sentinel honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying s horror highlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery you re not likely to forget easy alison parker a ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas moves into a stunning brownstone apartment in brooklyn deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who proposed to wed her several times already alison s physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery she meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats even though the landlady claims she and a blind priest are the only tenants she frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide it slowly becomes clear that alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this it s truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the dvd immediately reveal that alison s brownstone apartment is the earth s gateway to hell itself and she s the chosen one to guard it because the film s script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation for nearly minutes and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences michael winner successfully maintains the impression that alison s own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her fianc e s odd behavior are strictly red herrings multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius like alison s flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs the whole climax with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail biting denouements i ever witnessed the cast michael winner managed to gather is deeply impressive especially considering the sentinel still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre isn t the most popular among prominent actors but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective with such an extended cast obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos martin balsam and john carradine for example only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together several others like christopher walken jeff goldblum beverly d angelo and tom berenger perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers my personal pick for best performances go to burgess meredith as the uncanny neighbor and eli wallach as the satirical police inspector the relatively unknown cristina raines does an admirable job carrying the film and chris sarandon neatly back her up even though he sports a ridiculous mustache in my humble opinion the sentinel is a marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie and most definitely a must see for true genre fanatics 
man i really love the new dvd that universal put out i ve never seen the sentinel look this good since i had to put up with crappy grainy vhs tapes for years unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear and avoid the goodtimes dvd at all costs it sucks anyway troubled fashion model alison parker cristina raines moves into haunted nyc brownstone only it s more than just haunted it s also a portal to hell and the vatican keeps an old blind priest john carradine to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and arch angels don t escape this has an all star cast full of old timey actors like ava gardner arthur kennedy jose ferrer etc as well as cameos of upcoming s stars including christopher walken jeff goldblum who s voice was mysteriously overdubbed and tom berenger and you won t even recognize jerry orbach from law order i had to do a double take when i didn t quite place where i d seen him before nice gore scenes of alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father s rotting corpse that s been possessed by the devil and there s a neat ending where disfigured deformed people try to haunt alison into committing suicide so she won t be the next one to guard the portal it seems alison s troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the vatican to become the next sentinel an excellent creepy s classic from director michael winner that shouldn t be missed i also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy out of 
 the sentinel is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie s industry i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are alison parker is a model with some fame she dates a lawyer called michael lerman and has as a best friend another model called jennifer everything was great in her life until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a beautiful and old apartment the problem are her neighbors who are very very strange suddenly alison starts to have health problems and faints with frequency she also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions but everything has a reason and it has to do with the new house she is living i personally find the sentinel a very creepy movie and along with the exorcist they are two of the scariest movies i already watched when we discover that alison s house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood froze it s also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world 
bored with the normal run of the mill staple films to watch this halloween that i ve seen over and over again i took a chance on the sentinel hoping it could get my horror juices flowing again mind you i had just come back from seeing the dark castle remake of the house on haunted hill complete and utter crap thankfully the sentinel blew me away in a riviting story about a model who moves into a creepy building in brooklyn hights the film offered everything that i hope to find in a good movie campy and fantasically juicy characters exchanges and dialogue including hilaraious turns by christopher walken jeff goldblum and especially martin balsam as an absent minded professor horrifying terror not to give a frame away but there are scenes in this film that chilled me to my pancreas fantastic gore terrific make up and wacky if very uneven direction from michael winner which flows rather nicely with this unreal treat if you loved evil dead dead alive and deep rising this will be your queen of favourites just to emphasize my love for this film after i watched it for the first time jaw dropped i rewound it and watched it again it is now one of favourites of all time do yourself a favour and check it out 
for those that were interested in knowing how exactly humanity came to be encased in big red pods that make me crave pomegranate there is the duo of the second renaissance shorts i m not exactly sure why they are split into two parts especially since they re credited as one on the dvd and are these shorts viewed on any other format but the dvd but they re informative even if they have a few gaps what really makes this first part stand out from the second part and the rest of the animations as well is the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights graphic homages to slavery fascism concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the million man march and humanity s god complex in fact god is never really referenced by these shorts instead replaced by man s own image as far as the shorts go in the collection the second renaissance part i is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion it s a sorrowful and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become the architect of its own destruction some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature but then again that s basically what most of the matrix series has done and it s been a driving force behind its success polarisdib
along with it s partner this is the greatest piece of animation ever created the images and styles are amazing and match perfectly with the story which is a brilliantly realistic reinterpretation of our own world where is has been and where it could go quite affecting and sometimes painful to watch it it a masterpiece of the visual art 
this is the second part of the animatrix a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of the matrix in this one we learn how men and machines could not work and live together it is a little history lesson in the world of the matrix not as good as the first part the final flight of the osiris but still pretty entertaining 
the first time you see the second renaissance it may look boring look at it at least twice and definitely watch part it will change your view of the matrix are the human people the ones who started the war is ai a bad thing 
what was always missing with the matrix story was how things came to be in the real world say no more because this part of the story covered most of the bases what was truly interesting was how political it was maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity what i also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown we as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people can t believe the contrary well represented and put together this a true testament to how illogical humans can be 
i think the movie was pretty good will add it to my clasic collection after all this time i believe i saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie maybe some of the more esoteric points defy logic but a great many religious matters accepted on faith fail to pass the smell test if you re going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie is it just me or has anyone else noticed the aja yee dagger is the same possessed knife lamonte cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in the shadow no mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here imdb but i would bet a dollar to a donut it s the same prop 
you d be forgiven to think a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at directing an american horror movie especially one entirely located inside a us prison see this to prove yourself wrong it was produced in the s after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern diy company tv advert something i think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to m budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind being mr harlin s first major production and the at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar cast i still think most of the nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with stellan stargaard s screen appearances not mentioning the well overrated mr s bergman directorial efforts at least for all female viewers but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense do try and watch this movie even if you re not a horror puff imo it s definitely worth it 
caught this film in about on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn t like it as it was not what they wanted to see the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you re a fan of the genre it has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself an absolute diamond a film i still have on video to this day check it out 
i pulled down a vhs box from my vast collection many unseen and picked out a movie based on the box art i thought would be fun and yes bad prison had that s cheesy look all over that box i sat down and watched and lo and behold found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind fortunately i reversed mine quickly and soon realized i was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total prison tells the story of an old dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns it looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners the prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film the story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair we see lane smith as a guard tearing away a crucifix before sending the man to his maker we then go to present day first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she campaigned vigorously against re opening the old prison then we see the new warden lane smith haunted by a nightmare in bed and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years well the rest follows suit prisoners and guards arrive with plenty of stereotypes abounding we are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters the acting is better than one might expect with lane smith doing as always a workmanlike job viggo mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid tom everett tiny lister and ivan kane really exploring the boundaries of their stereotypical characters chelsea field is okay as the female lead the best performance is by lincoln kilpatrick an underrated character actor as cresus a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the man had been executed with some kind of terrible secret prison is not the next best thing to sliced bread or anything like that but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it i was pleasantly surprised at the way director renny harlin created a story so visually atmospheric the film has a tense taut pace and harlin knows how to build his scenes there are a few excessively shot gore scenes the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes but these scenes are visually creative and interesting the acting is uniformly decent the script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these that may in part be credited to irwin yablans who wrote the story you may remember he came up with the idea of making halloween scary as a holiday here he makes incarceration a hell of a lot more scarier than it already is give prison a break get it 
story of a wrongly executed prisoner who haunts the prison he was electrocuted in and kills random prisoners while waiting to take revenge on the man who framed him viggo mortensen is great and the acting is pretty good overall lane smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty warden also this film has some great gore including death by barbed wire mummification 
i love this movie like no other another time i will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue which please remember is all tongue in cheek aussies and poms will understand everyone else well title song lyric he can sink a beer he can pick a queer in his latest double breasted bondi gear another song lyric all pommies are bastards bastards or worse and england is the a e hole of the universe during a television interview on an arty program mr mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you ve been in england barry s response flamin bull artists while chatting up a naive young pom girl mr mackenzie i suppose you have hordes of aboriginal servants back in australia barry s response abos i ve never seen an abo in me life mum does most of the solid yacca ie hard work round our place this is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser aussie flick if you can get a copy of it watch and enjoy 
very smart sometimes shocking i just love it it shoved one more side of david s brilliant talent he impressed me greatly david is the best the movie captivates your attention for every second 
this movie really kicked some ass i watched it over and over and it never got boring angelina jolie really kicked some ass in the movie you should see the movie you won t be disappointed and another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from the x files is in it david duchovny 
like i said its a hidden surprise it well written well acted and well cast i liked everything in this movie look its hollywood all right but the brighter side angelina jolie is great in this and i m totally watching every movie with her in that i can get my hands on well worth a look 
this film has a lot of raw potential the script is sharp the dialogue is usually excellent though it could stand to lose the cheezy voice overs the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good though some of the experimentation just doesn t work the main problem here is david duchovny once a geek boy always a geek boy and the sad simple fact is that he s incapable of playing anything but fox mulder he postures he tries to be slick he poses he tries to be macho in the end he just tries too hard he overplays his character he overspeaks his lines and he s just outplayed in all ways by timothy hutton and angelina jolie who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill timothy hutton was as always really good there was a spotty moment or two where he over dramatized his role but you could tell he was having fun with it he looked the part and he became the character both physically and atmospherically angelina jolie was also really good she didn t have much of a role in fact i though she could have used a much stronger one her character wasn t nearly developed enough though she did remarkably well with what she had and the chemistry between her and hutton was apparent gee maybe that s why uma left him all in all it was rough around the edges but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles if david duchovny hadn t ripped his role to pieces it would ve been that much better 
i enjoyed this movie unlike like some of the pumped up steroid trash that is passed off as action movies playing god is simple and realistic with characters that are believable action that is not over the top and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the end well directed well acted and a good story 
david duchovny plays the lead role in this film now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn t even bother watching it very unfair to say the least david made his name on the x files and is a decent actor dr eugene sands duchovny is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice by sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire raymond blossom however the fbi take an interest in using eugene to snare blossom angelina jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare the gangsters moll she puts in a solid performance timothy hutton playing blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character duchovny himself isn t as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible his familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen t detract too much from the film
i love this film it is well written and acted and has good cinematography the story blends action humor mysticism and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots see it buy it show it to your friends the acting is good and murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant unlikely hero i enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions i cared what happened to these people and while the outcome was pretty predictable the good guys win the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives who doesn t see that coming it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end thank god this film s dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel grab some popcorn cuddle up on the couch and watch this fun happy and entertaining film 
okay truthfully i saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself what are the producers thinking hutton jolie and duchovny how could the monotoned actor possibly compete with jolie s natural power on the screen but surprisingly the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss even david s humor matched up to jolie s spark and fire as for hutton he played the psycho very well contrasting with david s calm delivery of life threatening situations overall i was very impressed with the writing and character development i gave it stars 
while the main story is supposed to take place in morocco this movie was shot in foggy romania in days on a very tight budget however broken their cards may be the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment so that in the end i found the result both touching and graceful nikolaj coaster waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy the script and direction provide some gems whether you will like the movie or not however will probably depend on your take on alexandra staden in the title role other reviewers have pointed out staden s inadequacies as modesty blaise they may have a point but i found her interpretation delightful and very fitting modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline innate talent and courage staden appears to be doing the same here 
every once in a while eddie murphy will surprise you in a movie like the golden child especially this is a movie you d figure would star maybe harrison ford or kurt russell or someone but eddie really does work he s smart he s funny he s brave kind courteous thrifty clean and everything else a hero should be having been chosen to secure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil embodied perfectly by dance eddie goes from california to nepal and back all while the beautiful kee nang lewis wonders if he s all he says he is and a crazy old holy man wong perfect as always knows that he is it s exciting breathtaking in spots shocking and of course funny eddie is the only action hero i know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart aleck remarks about ed mcmahon no problem with this child it s a golden find nine stars viva nepal 
this was the modesty that we didn t know it was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for the syndicates to sell to newspapers lee and janet batchler were true modesty blaise fans who were given the dream job tell a prequel story of modesty that the fans never saw before in their audio commentary they admitted that that they made changes in her origin to make the story run smoother the purists should also note that we really don t know if everything she told miklos was true because she was stalling for time i didn t rent or borrow the dvd like other reviewers did i bought it and i don t want a refund i watched it three times and i didn t sleep through it great dialog and well drawn characters that i cared about even bad guy miklos just like in the novels and comic strips i too can t wait for the next modesty and willie film especially if this prequel is a sign of what s to come 
first off i m a dedicated fan of modesty s and have been reading the comics since i was a child and i have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying but where they fail this one rocks well then here we go ms blaise is working for a casino a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives if the robber wins one round she ll have to tell him about herself if she wins two times in a row one of the staff members goes free sounds stupid yeah well i m not that good at explaining either she tells him about growing up in a war zone without parents or friends about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape living by nature s own rules they hunt for food and he teaches her to read and fight as they approach civilization they get caught up in a war and as they are taken for rebellions they are being shot at and the old man dies which leaves her to meet the city by herself then she meets the man who s casino she s now working for and there the story ends what is to follow is that there s an awesome fight and the line s are totally cool alexandra staden is a terrific modesty blaise just as modest and strong graceful and intellectual as the comic one feels awkward though too hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent but that s not relevant since the comic book blaise can t speak out loud but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent not to mention that it s weird everybody s speaking english in the balkan the acting is really good even the child who personifies the young blaise must have a applaud my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robber s ass totally awesome d i can t wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie s watch it you won t be disappointed 
i first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it charles dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine his sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero i have never been much of an eddie murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner a bit of axel foley through the looking glass charlotte lewis is to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable luminously gorgeous some scenes are wonderfully created the dream sequence the bird the silly fight scenes and the climactic confrontation through it all murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth a stunned and quieter version of kurt russell in his oriental fantasy romp like that movie we have james hong the incomparable actor whose scenes however short raise the quality even of derek since hong has defined the fine supporting actor the class act of his profession the golden child is silly it is not perfect but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy well worth watching after four years i have seen the golden child again i enjoyed it even more it truly is great fun 
magellan said you can only do so much when the two stars of the show can only be seen by one fellow cast member i assume then that you never heard of topper which in addition to the two stars who could only be seen by one member of the cast had a dog ditto this was the kind of program that had not gonna make it written allover it from the first episode it was like an arcade video game where you actually have to read the instructions to play no one well very few of us apparently wants to watch a comedy program that has a basic premise that actually requires thought to grasp 
i used to watch this show when i was a little girl although i don t remember much about it i must say that it was a pretty good show also i don t think i ve seen every episode however if you ask me it was still a good show i vaguely remember the theme song everyone was ideally cast the costume design was great the performances were top grade too i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i ll be able to see every episode before i wrap this up i d like to say that i ll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don t think i ve seen every episode now in conclusion when and if this show is ever brought back on the air i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good 
short synopsis this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men one of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids so it is really serious with exposed well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women one gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion a last encounter a last light for a cigarette adieu l ami farewell friend i found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters played by classical he man superstars alain delon and charles bronson they are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow a little like deliverance it is also very stylish the safe the two men want to crack is in a for the time ultra modern glass and aluminum tower it is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around the wardrobe is also very good the ultra stylish citroen ds maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie perhaps a subtle kind of product placement i can recommend this movie for the actor s performances alone delon and bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting both do a considerable amount of acrobatics i have never seen bronson better than here he really acts and speaks french throughout with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed and it is certainly the man himself we hear so the french language version is highly recommended the police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite franch character actors bernard fresson who was gene hackman s partner in french connection ii he is the best brainy police inspector i know also very good is former child actress brigitte fossey as the young ing nue who as it turns out is not so innocent as it first seems anyone who expects the old in an out of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake 
utterly tactical strange watch for the kinky moment of a drop dead gorgeous blonde acting as pull string doll for some rich folks pointless but undoubtedly compelling late night feature this unhinged french production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars if somewhat anti heroes alain delon and charles bronson really they don t get to do all that much especially during the confined lengthy mid section where they hide themselves in a building during the christmas break to crack a safe with possible combinations oh fun but this is when the odd if intriguing relationship is formed between delon and bronson s characters after a manipulative battle of wills and childishly sly games against each other the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each other s involvement and have a mutual respect this would go on to play a further part in the twisty second half of the story with that undetectable curve ball still their encounters early on suggest there s more but what we get is vague and this is magnified by that what just happen there ending that might just make you jump yeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhh glad to get that out of the system the pacing is terribly slow but placidly measured for it and this seems purposely done to exhaust with its edgy nervous underlining tension watch as the same process is repeated over and over again and you know something is not quite right and the scheming eventually comes into play now everything that does happen feels too spontaneous but the climax payoff is haunting the taut complex script is probably a little too crafty for its own good but there are some neat novelties coins glass and liquids try not spilling and visual symbolisms jean herman s direction is efficiently sophisticated and low key but get a tad artificial and infuse an unwelcoming icy atmosphere the sound fx features more as a potent note than that of francois deroubaix s funky score that s mainly kept under wrapped after its sizzling opening top drawers delon who s quite steely and bronson a jovial turn are solid and work off each tremendously bernard fresson chalks up the attitude as the inspector who knows there s more going on than what is being led on an attractive female cast features able support by brigitte fossey and olga georges picot a cryptically directionless but polished crime drama maintained by its two leads and some bizarre inclusions 
this movie is definately one of my favourite movies in it s kind the interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen it treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that i can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies the sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake no such scenes are present or needed the argument is flowless and honest to the spectator wich is an important asset in a genre in wich the the suspense is often achieved through the betrail of the audience no this is not miss marble a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savour every minute not just to see 
whenever i see most reviews it s called a misfire for eddie murphy these critics want to take a look at some of the stuff he s doing these days and maybe soften their stance in retrospect the golden child is not highbrow entertainment but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clich s and gives murphy one of his best roles i don t understand the pervading lack of love for its efforts at all perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout thrill a minute adventures steven spielberg started it with indiana jones it s unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless there s nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends yes it s silly but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that ridiculous is where hollywood s idea of mysticism begins and ends what s more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights michael ritchie and eddie murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine my advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride 
farewell friend aka adieu l ami honour among thieves isn t perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed french algerian war veterans alain delon and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault one to return stolen bonds the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the christmas weekend naturally things aren t quite that simple even after they open the vault leading to some neat twists and turns on the debit side there s a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park bronson has a very irritating fonzie like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments brigitte fossey sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the s it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind is something of a liability her i ll cook spaghetti i ll learn to make love well i ll read shakespeare speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways and it s a shame about the horrible last line shot but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that s worth checking out if you can find a decent print cinema club s uk dvd only offers the english soundtrack but since delon voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed that s no great problem especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality 
noni hazlehurst colin friels alice garner chrissie amphlett and michael caton what more could you ask for monkey grip based on the prize winning novel of the same name explores nora hazlehurst a single mother falling for a heroin addict jobe friels a simple story is made truly extraordinary through the all round magnificent acting in particular noni hazlehurst and nice use of the small budget the only flaw is if you can pick it up is that the story is set in melbourne although for budget reasons the film was mainly shot in sydney so as a result in a few scenes you see trams melbourne scenes and then a carlton post office sydney scenes other than that monkey grip is a must see excuse the clique but it is at least for an award winning performance from former play school and better homes gardens presenter noni hazlehurst 
i definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film this book won national book council award in and is a very gripping read pun not intended it s not too difficult to read for those out there that don t read often so don t be afraid the book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book having grown up in melbourne i could really relate to this book and movie very few australian female writers were around the in the s therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in australia during this era or class it s a precious piece of melbourne history it s a shame that it is documented as some sort of s soft porn movie it s far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the dvd jacket it does not represent what the movie is about at all those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed just remember this movie was made in so don t expect the hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days this is what i like about it it s also great seeing noni hazlehurst in this role she is just fantastic as nora and it s great watching her really acting for if you re close to my age you will best remember her for her stints on playschool and better homes and gardens who knew she hid this talent this movie will give you an entirely new impression of her a classic australian story 
if jean renoir s first film whirlpool of fate first takes us into the world of the countryside the rivers the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great grand illusion and rules of the game this is beautifully filmed with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the film s interiors and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well particularly from werner krauss muffat but the glamorous and sultry ms hessling who at first appears as if she might give louise brooks a run for her money in vampishness never goes beyond a one note selfish harlot portrayal perhaps this is in part a problem with the script which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions not having read the novel i m not really clear on whether the choices were well made or not still the differences between nana s suitors are well drawn and i particularly liked the relationship between muffat and jean angelo s vandeuvres the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where vandeuvres warns muffat and we wonder if violence will erupt this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it has far from his greatest achievement and for me probably just shy overall of whirlpool of fate this is still well worth seeing for renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally 
the premise may seem goofy but since murphy s character doesn t take it seriously it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modern day hard boiled child abduction excellent cast particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis and murphy is at the height of his s peak in comedy action there s also some great f x a very surreal dream sequence and a fairly original plot often overlooked in the pantheon of murphy flicks but this one is worth a look 
the little girl desi is so adorable i cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here it will make you cry laugh and believe knowing that this was based on a true story just made me gasp and it also made me realize that there are nice people out there great cast and an overall great movie 
a warm touching movie that has a fantasy like quality ellen burstyn is as always superb samantha mathis has given many great performances but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory most of all you ve got to see this amazing yr old jodelle ferland i was so captivated by her presence i had to buy the movie so i could watch her again and again she is a miracle of god s creation judging by the high imdb rating i m not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress 
and look how a true story with a little help of it s friends a welldone and touching script a good directing and a surprising great acting from a bunch of no name actors especially from the yr old jodelle ferland becomes a must seen movie 
this is just a short comment but i stumbled onto this movie by chance and i loved it the acting is great the story is simple and touching and the lines especially from the yr old desi are so cute and sad seek it out

i loved this movie i totally disagree with some negative critiques that i ve read over the years this was a great vehicle for eddie murphy he appeared to have a great time with his part as chandler jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say if he had fun doing it and most of his audience enjoyed it and it was fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with mr murphy s great comedic style you have to keep in mind that golden child is a fantasy film just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the real world during the time this film was released i was working in a video rental store this was one of the most popular with all our customers every single time we put this one up on our monitor all the copies we had went out fast with wait list requests that kept it on the queue for months everyone who rented it loved it i was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented this was one of my favorites and i knew the taste of my customers so i highly recommended this one to most of them i really feel that this film is a sleeper it may not have done too well at the box office due to very poor marketing but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later yes i did buy this film for my own video library i adored the little boy who played the golden child j l reate but after looking at his profile in imdb i noticed that he never did any more films that is sad because he definitely had an on screen aura and could have continued with a film career i also adored victor wong who played the old man i loved him in his part as egg shen in big trouble in little china at any rate this was a great film the only drawbacks that didn t seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more adult in nature such as chandler s rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette it was funny but it still was out of sync ok so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes those were put in for the mind set of the day perhaps this was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from hollywood now that s entertainment 
ok so i don t watch too many horror movies and the reason is films like dark remains i caught this on a surprisingly feature filled dvd and it scared me silly in fact the only extra i think the dvd was missing was a pair of new pants however the next day i was telling someone about it when i realised i d only really seen about of it the rest of the time i d been watching the pizza on my coffee table nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if i actually covered my eyes the few times i did brave watching the screen i jumped so hard that i decided not to look up again the film making is solid and the characters situation was really compelling the simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump button it s merely a woodland a cabin and a disused jail and a lot of darkness most surprising to me was the fact that while this was clearly not a multi million dollar production the make up effects really looked like it was also it s obvious this is a film made by someone with a great love of film making the sound design and the music really made use of my surround system like many hollywood movies have never done i noticed on line that this film won the la shriekfest a really major achievement and i guess that the festival had seen the filmmakers clear talent and probably a great deal more of this movie than i managed to turn up the sound turn off the lights and if you want to keep your girlfriend order a pizza 
i read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and more this is the way a proper horror movie should be i think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic the spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood i liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out it was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated the special effects were very good i would love to see more horror movies like this one this is easily one of my favorite s a realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs i highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches i will be adding it to my collection the dvd has some interesting special features 
although i was in this movie playing the part of sheriff hodges it still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me i m not that easy you might say that i m biased about the film and ok i am but i didn t see the finished product until and was extremely pleased i m not a horror film fan as such but love the old b movies and black and white sci fi films this movie will make you think you know when something is going to happen then it doesn t then it does it will keep you completely off balance i would suggest watching the movie first then the director s notes and special features it is so well written directed and filmed and i can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew i sincerely hope to be part of brian and laurence s future projects 
i just watched this movie and have to say i was very impressed it s very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise i d say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was coming although it contains virtually every clich in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fear factor it had elements of the shining the th sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the changeling i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old fashioned scare 
well this film is a difficult one really to be straight with you this film doesn t contain much of a riveting story nore does it make u want to know how it ll end but i ll tell you something now never have i been as tense and jumped up before in my life this film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills to be fair i did watch it at almost midnight so i was kinda sleepy anyway so maybe that explains why i was jumpy or maybe it s because this film does deliver in that aspect it s basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event they decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors i think it s it s the sister of the main character and she brings along her husband during the night the husband hears noises checks it out and thats when things start to go really really wrong they don t stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isn t right to cut a long story short eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of it s not a hollywood blockbuster nore does it have a huge budget but please don t let that put you off it s creepy tense and very very jumpy just give it a try 
dark remains is a home run plain and simple the film is full of creepy visuals and scares that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat the staircase scene in particular these guys are good although they weren t working on a huge budget everything looks good and the actors come through dark remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some but i guess it makes you think cheri christian and greg thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives however some side characters like the sheriff didn t convince me they aren t all that important anyways i give dark remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story japanese remake 
 the golden child was eddie murphy s first film since his megahit beverly hills cop and even though it s not as good as cop it s a fun comic adventure murphy stars as a finder of lost children who s assigned a most unusual case his assignment to find the title character a child with mystical powers this movie could have been titled beverly hills cop and the temple of doom since parts of this movie plays like a spielbergian adventure kinda like an indiana jones comedy it s got comedy with laughs and adventure with special effects lots of fun out of four 
what s good about it some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan doesn t rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its gotcha moments even if you ve seen everything there s still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop what could have been better about it the acting was at times flat and unconvincing it had a shot on video quality in some places though it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for and the camera work is full of needless close ups of meaningless actions though the effects are genuinely creepy i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them the ending seemed rushed and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed it still a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average well worth the rental 
if you haven t already seen this movie of mary kate and ashley s then all i can say is what are you waiting for this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins that we all know and love so much it s fun romantic exciting and absolutely breath taking scenery wise of course as always mary kate and ashley are the main scenery here anyway would any true fan want it any other way of course not anyway it s a great movie in every sense of the word so if you haven t already seen it then you just have to now i mean right now too so what are you waiting for i promise that you won t be disappointed sincerely rick morris
i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy s bodacious bod if you don t expect anything else such as clever plot twists and believable character development you won t be disappointed consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who threaten to come between her and her mommy suzanna arquette who obviously doesn t want to play the sex kitten she leaves that up to her daughter mandy s face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a perfect to ratio of waist to hips and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio and no flat butt to boot which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the nether hemispheres mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle lit hot tub with her blindfolded german guy victim no but from all i could see from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didn t need a double to prove it mandy s acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic mommy s girl with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no who also happened to be her mother s lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise one dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason mandy s uber nordic facial features coupled with her uber voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress i d advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages especially italian and spanish and maybe french although i don t know if they would go for her type but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the s whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground vambo drule 
 contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own risk i loved this film the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen her face is huge in the back and leo s is in the foreground one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub you can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepy the use of text in the film was unique like when leo s character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a film the use of black comedy in this film was well done ernst hugo j reg rd is great as leo s uncle it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom riget this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww and all the chaos easier to take it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about it the voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leo s head which at times is a scary place to be the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don t choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjork s character doesn t speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed anti woman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters don t fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but of course they never do 
this documentary explores a story covered in pilger s latest book freedom next time which was published in it reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of diego garcia one of the chagos islands in the indian ocean the islanders are technically british citizens as diego garcia is a british colony much like mauritius the nearby island to where the natives were exiled used to be but the british government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland as the island is now a military base for the united states army who have used it as a basis for the bombing of iraq and afghanistan as usual pilger s coverage is shocking especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders his interviews all round are excellent and his cornering of a parliament representative where he uses the government s own information to pin him down ranks as one of his best pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the british conspiracy to evict the natives the weaving of this footage with the interviews and the islanders music really heightens the film s impact it is not easy viewing but stealing a nation is john pilger at his best recommended 
the endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me this truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard of population is compelling well documented and enraging as an american i am constantly humiliated by my country s behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement we suck this is probably the first john pilger documentary i ve seen but it immediately made me want to see what else he s done my only complaint and the reason i gave this film only out of is that pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk governments demands that we viewers citizens are complicit in our own inaction but makes no suggestion of how to help i don t know about britain but america s made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government s doings a gesture in the right direction might help these islanders cause 
ed harris s work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence that is he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it and that includes the formidable sean connery the movie which is more than a bit sanctimonious comes alive only in the scenes when harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict it is breathtaking a master class in artistic control the other cast members are all adept and connery is reliable as is fishbourne but the story itself packs no wallop the plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers this is the engine which drives the story right or wrong and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end still worth watching to see harris in action 
this is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie there are many plots and turns the story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people this film is very well directed by arne glimcher and the fine sound of james newton howard is excellent strong performance of sean connery and ed harris if you liked this one don t miss true crimes or the hurricane my wife and me gave 
lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques some of them are very original while others are best forgotten he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey with so many cities lying in ruins leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration it is not a simple task as he quickly finds out his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles a terrible argument ensues when a passenger s shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details the railway journey is like an allegory representing man s procession through life with all its trials and tribulations in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz these images horrible as they are are fleeting as in a dream each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected at a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb in view of many by standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock later he jumps from the train at high speed and lies in the cool grass on a river bank looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task quite ridiculous in fact it could only happen in a dream it s strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed i prefer lars von trier s later films breaking the waves and the idiots the bomb scene described above really put me off perhaps i m a realist 
i really liked this film all three stars connery fishburne and underwood give credible performances and harris is enjoyably over the top the lighting and shot angles in some of harris scenes make his face look truly diabolical the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting not a great movie but an enjoyable one i gave it of 
a young and seemingly promising college graduate played by blair underwood is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young girl and is put on death row sean connery plays the happy go lucky attorney whom the young man s grandmother tracks down out of retirement and pleads with to take on the case in the hopes of freeing her grandson laurence fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is hell bent on debunking an theory that connery might dig up to try and free the boy whom he and the entire police department swear is guilty of the crime ed harris kate capshaw ruby dee and the late lynne thigpen co star in this very intense dramatic thriller 
just cause is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative though exceedingly predictable writing sean connery is an anti death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man blair underwood from the ultimate penalty to set things right connery ventures to the scene of the crime where he must contend not only with the passage of time but a meddling sheriff laurence fishbourne twists and turns and role reversals abound some surprising some not as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery the climactic ending is a bit ludicrous but just cause is worth a look on a slow night 
just cause takes some of the best parts of three films cape fear a touch of evil and silence of the lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film sean connery is a liberal law professor married to a former assistant district attorney kate capshaw and he s a crusader against capital punishment blair underwood s grandmother ruby dee buttonholes connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson s appeal he s sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl when connery arrives in this rural florida county he s up against a tough sheriff played by laurence fishburne who s about as ruthless in his crime solving as orson welles was in touch of evil later on after connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he s uncovered he s feeling pretty good about himself at that point the film takes a decided turn from touch of evil to cape fear to say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly the cast uniformly turns in some good performances special mention must be made of ed harris who plays a hannibal lecter like serial killer on death row with underwood he will make your skin crawl and he starts making connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises he s been basing his convictions on many a confirmed liberal i ve known has come out thinking quite differently once they ve become a crime victim of course the reverse is equally true many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteed criminal justice is not an end but a process and a never ending one at that for all society i guess if just cause has a moral that would probably be it 
a compelling thriller december author littlehammer from united states just cause starring sean connery laurence fishburne and blair underwood a liberal though good hearted harvard law professor paul armstrong is convoked to the flordia everglades by unjustly convicted black guy bobby earl confessing that sadistic cold hearted cops vilifyied and beat him to a pulp to get the confession of a gruesome murder of an eleven year old girl as he digs further and further into the mysterious case he realizes that bobby earl is a victim of discrimination that the black police detective lt tanny brown of the small community is corrupt and villainously mean when the infamous psychotic serial killer blair sullivan is introduced he discovers that he knows the location of the murder weapon that butchered the little girl when armstrong finds that there are lucid coincidences of sullivan s road trip through the small town and the letter he personally wrote bobby earl gets a re trial is unfettered from prison and eludes his horrific punishment all seems swimmingly well until an unexpected phone call from serial killer sullivan comes into focus armstrong discovers a lurid double killing which happens to be sullivan s parents whom he immensely detests sullivan divulges to armstrong the truth of joanie shriver s heinous murder and why he was brought here it turns out that bobby earl is a psychopathic murderer and he really did rape and kill joanie shriver he just merely struck a bargain with fiendish psycho sullivan to get loose so he could kill again for revenge upon armstrong s beautiful wife and daughter now sullivan is executed to his death armstrong and tough good guy brown chase the malevolent villain to the everglades in order to thwart him when they arrive armstrong learns that the psychotic sicko bobby earl plans to kill his wife and daughter for a former rape trial that inevitably made him endure agonizing pain and castration but good virtuous cop brown emerges and thwarts the brutal baddie is stabbed and eaten by ruthless man eating alligators paul armstrong tanny brown his wife and daughter survive and live happily ever after a good thriller that works delivers both mystery and subterfuge how reluctant blacks are hazed by racist lawmen sentenced to unfair penalties even though sometimes the wrongfully convicted innocent friendly black man may in truth be the vicious baddie sean connery is great as the oblivious holier than thou hero laurence fishburne is watchably amazing as the mean arrogant but good guy cop underwood and harris are over the top and invigorating as the malevolent psychos capeshaw is okay ruby dee is great as the tenacious grandmother the rest of the cast is wonderful as well 
zentropa is the most original movie i ve seen in years if you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days von trier s follow ups like breaking the waves have gotten more acclaim but this is really his best work it is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor it s too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future it s hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here but it s everyone s loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead 
never having seen this movie based on the entertaining novel by nicholas katzenbach and taking into consideration the first rate cast assembled for the production we decided to take a look just cause while not a horrible film takes too many liberties with the original material that jeb stuart didn t quite succeed in his treatment arne glimcher directed the first thing we think when a young black man is hauled to the local precinct for interrogation is police brutality after all sheriff tanny brown and police officer wilcox show no mercy in beating bobby earl who is accused of killing a young white girl we feel horrified by what the officers do to the prisoner then the scene changes evangeline bobby earl s grandmother is sent north to ask a distinguished harvard professor a retired lawyer the young man wants paul armstrong to defend him she old woman is convincing enough for armstrong to take a look at the case he is also convinced of the young man s innocence things are not exactly what we thought they were when blair sullivan a man who is serving time in the same facility as bobby earl comes forward to tell about how he is connected to the young girl s murder and changes the dynamics of the case the way it plays in the movie it serves to confuse the viewer and distract armstrong from arriving at the truth this thriller is made enjoyable by sean connery who plays armstrong laurence fishburne an intense actor makes a fine impression as the sheriff who as far as we can see is guilty of abusing his prisoner ed harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors blair underwood kate capshaw ruby dee and the young scarlett johansson are seen in supporting roles the film even with its faults will not disappoint 
enjoyable movie although i think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it it is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why elly is such a recluse then when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isn t much detail perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something anyway it is still a good movie that i d watch again 
i found this movie to be charming i thought the characters were developed since as i watched i found myself caring about these people this is a period piece that i believe took place during the depression a single mother who is known as the town recluse she has reason to be puts an ad in the paper for a husband christopher reeve plays a ex con who happens into town looking for work he sees the ad and he goes out to see her she hires him i really had some chuckles as their relationship progresses because i found it easy to put myself in their shoes everything went on so matter of fact he needs the work so he doesn t want to upset her and she needing his help but doesn t want him to get the upper hand they dance around the fact that they begin to really need each other things start warming up until the big blowup i won t spoil it by telling you what happens but the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful i found the story to be very believable for the time it s taking place i think this is one of the better relationship stories out there maybe the younger generation won t get it but if you are over i think you ll like it and if you liked christopher reeve in somewhere in time you ll like him in this one also 
i love this film the noir imagery combined with spillane s no nonsense character mike hammer works marvellously to create a mood and feel seldom found in low budget detective films of the early fifties it may not be the maltese falcon but this film makes it s own solid contribution to the genre spillane is often criticised for alleged misogyny etc but his dames are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence poor old mike hammer as effectively played by biff elliott is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he meets when investigating the death of an army buddy when the penny finally drops his face is a picture good to see that s censorship did not force the film makers to omit the famous last line a bona fide low budget classic 
i consider this film to be the best one about mike hammer with biff elliott s performance the definitive mike hammer harry essex s script is excellent and contains many improvements on mickey spillane s novel his direction is strong and imaginative and he makes fine use of light and shadow the camera work by john alton is top notch as is the score by franz waxman the cast includes many veteran players as well as peggie castle in her memorable performance as charlotte manning all in all this is one of the finest private eye films ever made biff elliott and haary essex should have received more opportunities i have always treasured this film 
 the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self desctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at sympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked best simon geist is a man in his late s early s who creates a pop culture driven editorial magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitch slap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his live in female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the music video queen for a bunch of b rated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if you re in the indie art house crowd mark my words 
this film is as good as it is difficult to find the film s hero and writer and director is simon geist a man with an agenda he creates a fake magazine just to have the authority to interview the swine of los angeles the actors the models the musicians who believe that their own defecation doesn t smell with clever dialog zucovic succeeds in doing this sure the budget for this film was probably what he paid for a used car but this film is so solid and so well written that it works very well any person who can reenact edward munk s the scream in the reflection of a silver trashbin at a local coffee house should be nominated for some type of award give this film a chance and listen to what it says because they have been making the same car since it s called the car bravo zucovic bravo 
frustrated middle aged deputy district attorney george maxwell a fine performance by george e carey who also produced this picture can t stand his naggy frigid wife edith a perfectly bitchy anne bellamy anymore worse yet poor george is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter dishy brunette sheri jackson george has an adulterous fling with lovely enticing and free spirited swinging hippie babysitter candy wilson delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout patricia wymer complications ensue when george finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter julia freeman a nicely venomous turn by kathy williams who wants george to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend laurence mackey a frightening robert tessier who sports a head full of hair here from jail director tom laughlin yep the same dude who portrayed billy jack and screenwriter james mclarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity sizzling soft core sex and raw violence moreover they accurately peg the whole wild n easy uninhibited sensibility of the s youth culture and relate the plot in a tight minute running time thus ensuring that this movie doesn t overstay its welcome one definite highlight occurs when candy invites her groovy friends over the maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking wailing rock music and of course hot naked dancing chicks robert o ragland s funky score hits the gnarly spot stanton fox s stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings on best of all this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh faced pixie patricia wymer who positively lights up the screen with her sweet bubbly personality and captivating beauty a total trashy treat 
 let s bowl started out on local television in the twin cities it came on late at night something you d stumble across while channel surfing after your th bottle of hamm s even the ads were locally produced featuring wally outside grumpy s bar holding a microphone and stammering nervously ahh over to you steve sedahl not sure why but that one always made me laugh there was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips sedahl played it straight counter balanced by rich kronfeld s bizarre and hilarious wally hotvedt highlights included segments like how to properly dispose of an old bowling ball chuck them into a lake and tips on dating where the duo date a couple of hookers and wally ends with the bitter complaint i could have done that myself another segment what the duo did on their days off featured steve in beer can strewn hovel pigging out from the fridge while wally struggled to climb the cliffs at taylor s falls dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over sized headphones hilarious wally s awestruck comments about league bowlers and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights let s bowl was picked up by comedy central and had some good moments but the network never really knew what to do with it running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling competition which was never the point of the show the constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters ernie the pig butch etc were more distractions than anything else the whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced even jon stewart dissed let s bowl on the daily show not enough lame snide jokes an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better how often does a let s bowl come along in the world of modern television a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap the networks have the total crap part down cold but it s a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark strange funny little gem like let s bowl here s hoping they ll put it out on dvd 
first of all the movie is an ingenious work of art movie the plot was filled with surprises a little kid pretends to be a grown up inherits one million dollars and how he spends it i mean how whacked out is this walt disney really outdid themselves this time the comedy is most of the times expected but the other times unexpected i mean was this movie ok or was this movie ok it also teaches a lot about wise youths and i this kid is really wise and a bit time smart pants but also it sucks how the heck could a guy like that kid get a hot police babe and his dad let him go free that s like let a killer get bailed free for ten years if i were to do that i d get beaten with a suble jack a huge stick that stings when used to bench your butts really hard that kid is really lucky back to the story the movie makers really knew what they were doing when they made this movie but still it s not perfect the acting was good and bad the kid and woman had no chemistry neither did the father but the bros were excellent the special effects on the other hand was lame plus this movie isn t based on reality i hated and loved it at the same time 
this is a good movie something fun about watching money be blown at a super rate especially from a kid s point of view take it for what it is a fun little movie about a kid s dream coming true and what a kid might do with million dollars don t like it don t watch it they make movies for the watchers not the people that have nothing better to do then complain in their lives 
preston waters a years old boy has problems with his parents and brothers specially because of money issues he is crazy to have his own house and his own rules since his brothers always stole his saved money and his parents neglect his wishes one awful day preston was riding his bicycle it was the same day that the villain of the story quigley was trying to scape from the police and accidentally ran the car over preston s bike needing to be far away from the police quigley gives in a hurry a check to cover the damages of preston s bike the problem was it was a blank check preston is a clever boy and decides to have a high price on that check million dollars all that money gives preston things that he always wished for like a mansion with pool lots of toys and even a limousine the problems start to begin when the fbi and quigley wants to know where the money is making preston in a hard situation and facing many problems this movie was one of my favorites during my childhood 
this is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man phillipe harel as notre heros is a bit like an amalgam of robert de niro in taxi driver inspector clouseau in his stoicism and chauncey gardiner in being there also peter sellers he is single yet doesn t have a clue how to attract the opposite sex in fact he really makes no effort at all he has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom his friend jose garcia as tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood he s and admits he s never had sex very good outdoor shots of paris and rouen where the two software people travel on business they try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail my theory is that they re trying the wrong places they go to more or less youth nightclubs they should try the type that has older people more their own age harel increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de niro effort as in taxi driver urging his friend colleague to go and stab some bloke who s pulled a nice looking girl in the nightclub worth watching 
faithful adaptation of witty and interesting french novel about a cynical and depressed middle aged software engineer or something relying heavily on first person narration but none the worse for that downbeat in a petit bourgeois sort of way philosophical and blackly humorous the best way i could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual charles bukowski no disrespect to cb intended mordantly funny but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations the film s great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask why aren t other films like this one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film 
liked stanley iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie 
i first saw a track from this dvd at a hifi show nov in london i was not really into cream until now it was through a high end arcam system it sounded great with dts i had to get this dvd and i ll tell you this is by far the most exciting music dvd i have ever watched the performance of cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music dvd it does not matter what type of music you like this one will definitely grow on you it s the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and again even new musicians don t cut the mustard these days as these old rockers do 
so often a band will get together for a re union concert only to find that they just can t get it together not so here this concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish these three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone s ego this is obvious from the start before they even step on stage many faces in the crowd weren t even born when these guys first performed from the first song they capture that old magic that was cream men instruments no fuss clapton by his own admission said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboards synthesizers etc so we get to see him at his best ginger baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as some sort of drumming guru jack bruce just great they really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come this one s a for me 
i must say that i really had no idea that i was going to sit down and watch this movie i guess it was the fact that i had nothing better to do between class but for once a tv movie caught my interest more importantly helen hunt caught my eye i really wasn t a big fan of hers prior to this film sure i liked twister and as good as it gets but something about this movie really did it for me i would now see myself as a huge fan this movie comes with high marks from me give it a chance it won t let you down 
i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much it was well acted particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey it was a very interesting movie filled with drama and suspense from the beginning to the very end i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie it is excellent and has great acting

 spoilers highly charge police drama about a serial killer loose in and around the small town of riverside wisconsin who s being tracked down by the local police using policewoman gina pulasky helen hunt as an undercover decoy to catch him nothing new in this made for tv movie that you haven t seen before but the depth of the acting and screenplay is unusually good and brings out a lot about not only the killer but the policewoman s as well as her fellow policeman lover state of mind having been put under psychiatric care after shooting an armed and unstable assailant who attacked her partner with a rifle officer palusky is given the task to go undercover to get close to murder suspect kayle timler steven webber after he was positively identified by the little girl sahsa kim kluznick who saw him not far from where little timmy curtis was found stabbed times to death the next day getting a job at the mr c diner where tim works gina gets to become very friendly with him and later tells him in order to get tim to open up about him possibly being the serial murderer that she once killed in a hit and run accident a year old woman tim who is said to have a genius iq doesn t seem to pick up on gina s attempt to trap him even when he later sees her at a bowling alley with her fellow cops spending a night out playing some weird cat and mouse game with her tim at one point get s gina at knife point to admit that she s wired but gina tells him that she was forced to do it by the police to get a break and an early release from prison besides tim s instability and criminal actions we find out that gina isn t all there as well she seems to be suffering from her being rejected by her father who left her with a drunk and abusing mother as a young girl that s effecting her work as an undercover policewoman there s also the fact that gina s lover policeman will mccaid jeff fahey who s estranged from his wife and two kids who s also on the serial murder case is too overprotective of her that causes gina to almost blow her cover and that has her later being taken off her assignment put back on undercover duty by her boss capt cheney dan conway over the objections of officer mccaid after another young boy year old davy marish was found murdered gina finally get s herself together and gets tim to admit that he s the person who s responsible for the string of murders in the area gina does it by having a hidden tape recorder that she replaced the one that she gave to him to show how honest she is hidden on her the movie in the company of darkness wasn t really that exceptional but the acting by helen hunt jeff fahey and especially steven webber was it was these high caliber performances that lifted the film well above the average made for tv movie were used to seeing 
chalk this one up in the win column this was a superb movie the acting performances were great and the script was equally great helen hunt was magnificent as the riverside police officer gina pulasky gina was a complex character she was a rookie cop with the riverside police dept she ended up in an affair with a coworker that she knew had a wife and kids all the while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to catch a serial killer jeff fahey the ray liotta look alike did a bang up job as the confused often stammering police officer that had an affair with gina he was stoic as an officer but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extra marital affair steven weber most notably from the sitcom wings did a nice job as the quiet meek underachieving sociopath on the surface he was an innocent loser but beneath the surface lied a cold hearted killer weber really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys the entire movie was spectacular each scene each verbal exchange let us know more and more about the characters the production team did a phenomenal job with condensing days if not weeks worth of events into a minute movie this movie was a good example of doing a lot with little 
i have seen this movie more than several times on tv i always watch it again never turning the channel this movie is full of chilling surprises and absolutely edge of your seat suspenseful without being overbearing or stupid helen hunt s talent is magnificently shown in this movie i recommend this movie to anyone 
this anime was underrated and still is hardly the dorky kids movie as noted i still come back to this years after i first saw it one of the better movies released the animation while not perfect is good camera tricks give it a d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view it s a story to entertain not to question still one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes not to say its a childish movies there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all 
i felt compelled to write a review for space cobra as it has received a good score of stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive a strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten anime movie space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers this is an old movie and the animation shows but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm space cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch there are few if any references to specific japanese culture and great for anime novices to watch and enjoy space cobra himself is witty and likable i cannot say how much of this is due to the english dub or the intentions of the maker but this is one of the few japanese comedy characters that i find truly funny the style is very sixties barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by yello the style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along the strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note i cannot think of another anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly you barely realise that it is happening but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural you also really feel the characters went on a journey and they re lives were changed by the whole experience check out if you can 
you sit there for a half an hour and watch a story believing it all then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling and then put back together again brilliant one of the most exciting feature films at the san francisco international film festival is a documentary i don t know if other than andrew jarecki s capturing the friedmans there has ever been anything like anna broinowski s forbidden lie it features exposes defends reveals and questions everything about norma khouri author of honor lost the acclaimed and lambasted bestseller about honor killings in jordan what is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this exposure of khouri is made with khouri s full participation for the initial portion of the film khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in amman the story of the book she sounds completely believable convincing then her story is taken apart exposed by eminently believable and convincing people such as women s rights activists in jordan investigative reporters there and in australia where khouri lived for a while khouri comes back and denies the accusations taking a successful lie detector test in the process there comes another segment of devastating exposures not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value and then khouri comes back and faces the accusations not all but the essential ones in the matter of the book and the houdini act continues with round after round in this heavy weight seesaw prize fight surprise after surprise and there is no happy ending in the sense of resolution brilliant 
i saw this film at the adelaide film festival and was thoroughly intrigued for all minutes i like documentaries but often find them dragging with about minutes to go forbidden lie powered on though never losing my interest the film s subject is norma khoury a jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in with the publication of her book forbidden love a biographical story of sorts concerning a muslim friend of hers who was murdered by her family for having a relationship with a christian man a few years later though a few journalists started poking holes in the story leading the public to believe it was fraud the film covers this quickly but thoroughly in the beginning and from there we spend most of our time in the company of norma as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction director anna broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study and she conducts endless interviews with khoury as she seeks the truth as always in life the truth is not so easy to find norma fears for her life worried about violent backlash over the unsavoury portrait her novel paints of jordanian muslims she refuses to return to jordan and show us the facts broinowski is not deterred however and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us the result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con artist naturally what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow and ultimately we don t know whether to believe norma or not she s either a rather unfairly put upon woman trying to survive or a fantastic spinster the web of lies truths and half truths she turns through the film is brilliant the film uses much interview footage as well as dramatisations to tell it s story and broinowski uses these dramatisations to show us why people like norma are able to exist we want to be conned we go to the cinema every day and allow ourselves to believe what s happening on the screen is real that might just be me reading into things a bit too much it didn t come up in the q a with brionowski after the film but that s what i took away from it this is a great australian film and must receive an international release and a swag of awards if you ask me certainly the best film i saw at aff go see it if you get the chance 
i saw this movie at a college film festival back in the s i have been waiting forever for this movie to come out on video finally it s out it was made in brazil so i assumed that was why it hadn t made it to video yet i have been checking video stores for the past years waiting for this outstanding movie to come out it is one of my all time favorites but be warned it is weird like werner herzog weird its weirdness stems from its super realism the movie is based on a true incident back a few centuries ago in pre colonial times when europeans were first encountering the tribes in the amazon a white man is mistaken by a savage tribe of cannibals as their enemy so they intend to kill him before they dispatch him though they make him part of their tribe their custom the entire movie is like watching a national geographic documentary as he becomes an accepted member of their tribe that s it cosmic plotline no intense insight into the variety of human life definitely oh yeah be warned this film has definite nudity this is not some hollywood schlock flick about noble savages this film tells it like it was re read above national geographic super realism 
how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and life affirming it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were hoping maybe even beleiving it wouldn t utlimately this is the film s greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on you i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid s it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for 
i grew up in brazil and i used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coast where the movie was filmed the area is called parati and is part of the green coast of the rio de janeiro state it is some miles from the rio de janeiro city this movie brings back to life the world of th century brazil where europeans were barely starting to explore the coastline which was still in pristine state and sparsely populated by various native tribes french and portuguese fought each other for territory and for the upper hand on the brazil wood trade all the while negotiating with the natives who also fought each other for whatever reasons one french misfit a mercenary is left to die by his own compatriots but manages to escape and is kept prisoner by an all naked native tribe while he is a slave of the chief according to the customs of the tribe he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revenge what i love about this film is that it recreates in loving detail the natives villages and their way of life they walked naked and were cannibals and asks us to recognize and accept the life in those times as it was in a gorgeous garden of eden life was messy violent full of pathetic superstition and bizarre customs the europeans arrive and bring their own problems including more violence with better weapons and greed there is no romanticized noble savages or heroic explorers here it is just people trying to survive in a tough world the movie is neither unduly sympathetic nor dismissive of the natives from what i know of the subject the depiction is fairly accurate which adds an air of uniqueness to the project how many movies have you seen regarding the lives of brazilian natives and their early affairs with europeans 
i love this movie very much i watched it over and over i don t see why anyone would think this movie wasn t good maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it it is one of my favorite movies and i am not hindi at all but i do love it it might be a little like pretty woman but i haven t seen that and i don t think it s any better than this i don t know why you are all trashing about it but maybe you have a good reason but i think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie and to those who say it s not good at all well then i wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good as for everyone else that i watched it with they enjoyed it too so it surprises me that this many people don t like it as for rani mukherjee i think thats how you spell her last name she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever 
the year had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors other than mohabbatein and kaho naa pyaar hai nothing stood out cccc had lot of contraversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around india and abroad the only information given was that it was a suspense thriller the film is now been released in and the film was surprisingly quite good the main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled salman and preiti give a good performance where salman doesn t actually take is shirt off at all must be special effects rani plays salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with preiti who plays prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother the three main leads confirm after har di jo pyar karega they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistry apparently salman khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses rani s character does not know preiti is a prostitute until the end this kept from her and the rest of the family the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you the songs are all picturised well especially dekhne walon and the main title song the other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as salmans loving family abbas mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfully i say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer 
this documentary was interesting but it was also long so long it lasts a total of minutes like ben hur long but if your into that this is for you but only if you have a passion for movies like i do being that martin scorsese is my favorite director live and maybe even ever this is quite fascinating especially if you know the style of scorsese s works because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films not the best documentary film ever made but it is a leap for scorsese which is always good to watch a
i would never have thought i would almost cry viewing one minute excerpted from a black and white movie without sound thanks to martin scorsese i did the movie was from f borzage you will start to understand if it s not already the case what makes a good movie 
as a rebuttle of sorts to the afi s top films the british film institute worked out a documentary with martin scorsese now i am a huge film fan and pride myself on having seen many many films but i am nowheres in comparrison with my idol in this fantastic though long documentary scorsese walks the viewer through several stages of the american history on film this is divided in to several sections including the western the gangster film and the noir full of bouncy enthusiasm martin scorsese is a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor 
thank the lord for martin scorsese and his love of the movies this is the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented american artist working in cinema today and i couldn t recommend it more i was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world you ll love it 
someone release this movie on dvd so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so called films of the s and see how vapid they were for the most part and how lars von trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece as it stands zentropa or europa as it is referred to outside the us is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post wwii europe namely the decimated german landscape whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people von trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen you will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late s with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train literally when you see this movie you are witnessing the evolution of an art form for some reason von trier got caught up in his own dogma movement shortly after this and while his breaking the waves and dancer in the dark are classics in their own right it is with zentropa that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights ages like a fine wine and begs for a dvd release 
never viewed this film and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors in the period that this film was made people in america were different there was no tv or all the modern things we have today except the radio and the starting out of great films being made in hollywood sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today ann shirley murder my sweet played a young orphan gal who was called carrot top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks who were like two wise owls and watched over ann shirley it was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened the entire town found out about it within minutes it is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living today it seems very corn ball and stupid but believe me this was the way people were in america during the s and they were a great generation that loved good family films 
for people interested in business and the corporate world this show is simply the best of the best as one of the former contestants of the show wrote in his blog about this innovative show people in business finally had an audience the whole idea is perfect having a group of businesspeople competing against each other in business related tasks set in the best place in the world new york city donald trump is perfect as the boss even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity he also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire which is one of the negatives about the show season great season overall the best season of the normal ones this season was the one that was most about actual business skills later on the series almost drowned in marketing related tasks with way too many product placements great and interesting contestants overall with the most likable character ever in this series troy i know i m not the only person who suspect that the trump world tower episode where he got fired was rigged to have amy and nick win this particular task season also a great season the tasks were still pretty much ok and it had many interesting contestants jen m was terrible and should never had made it to the final imo also this season had the worst firing ever pamela season terrible actually i liked the concept of book smarts vs street smarts but the cast was so utterly terrible it turned out that trump hated the cast as well that the whole season was a total disaster best moments was the second episode motel renovation with pm brian fired a guy who added nothing but huge amounts of comedy value season an excellent season much because of the interesting and entertaining contestants this season especially randall alla marcus and the total disaster whose name was toral the take me out to the boardroom episode is one of the absolute classics of this show ending with the well remembered quadruple firing sadly i think we got robbed for the randall vs alla final i think trump was afraid that she could have won and prevented that from happening season a boring season with really no special things to it brent was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama the tasks were terrible overall how has creating a jingle anything to do with business at all i guess the best man won but personally i couldn t care less season i can see why they wanted to try out l a as a new location for the show but looking back it was a mistake new york will always be the place for this this season added so many new things most of them terrible like losing team having to sleep outside in tents winning pm continues to be pm for example the tasks were terrible and trump also chose the wrong winner james deserved it no doubt season celebrity edition best season ever totally different rules like the use of rolodexes but all fun and entertainment the biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not real celebrities at all especially the women where everyone were unknown to me except for omarosa who is a total disgrace to everything she takes part in this looked to be gene simmon s season but after he made a complete fool of himself during the kodak task another man emerged from the shadows piers morgan never has anyone dominated a season like he did he crushed his opponents and also came across as a guy with a great sense of humor although some uptight americans not all americans of course don t take me wrong sadly didn t have the social skills to understand it way to go piers for fans of this i highly recommend the uk version starring sir alan sugar as the boss in fact the british version is way better and that says something since the american and original truly is a great show one thing about the uk version is that the contestants normally tend to behave like decent human beings in the boardroom unlike the constant yelling and rude behavior that takes place in the us version 
the interesting aspect of the apprentice is it demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume do not necessarily predict teamwork skills task dedication and job performance and they certainly don t reveal any hidden agendas in other words a good indicator of potential may be to see a job applicant in action which is the point of the apprentice people vying for a corporate position may hand over a sugar coated resume and put on their best personality attire for the interview but these are not necessarily the best indicator of strengths weaknesses and performance briefly the apprentice involves job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity a position in real estate magnate donald trump s investment company the apprentice refers to the winner who will win a salaried position learn the art of high stakes deal making from the master himself and presumably gain prime corporate connections the position is a dream come true for those wanting to make more money than the gnp of some foreign countries to entice the candidates trump shows off his private jet his private luxury apartments replete with statues and artwork his limos his connections to celebrities and other aspects of the life of a billionaire magnate the road to success is not easy the group is divided into two teams that compete against each other each has a corporate sounding name such as versacorps and prot g corporation the teams are assigned tasks that entail an entrepreneurial venture such as creating advertising selling merchandise or negotiating teams select a project manager who provides the leadership and organizational skills to complete the task if they win the manager receives a lot of credit particularly in the eyes of the final arbiter if they lose the manager may also become the scape goat some of the tasks are monumentally difficult with only a day or two to complete tasks may involve creating a tv commercial or print ad others may involve selling at a retail outlet or on the street the tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants they often show immediately who is the most reliable who is the most trustworthy and who is hard working and the tasks also expose who is not a good team player who is inefficient and who seems only out for themselves the tasks invariably reveal in unexpected ways the strengths and weaknesses of the participants and in particular the project manager how well the manager communicates with the team delegates work organizes time and sets specific goals will largely determine the outcome but it does not necessarily predict the winner the single most telling aspect of someone s potential is when he or she is assigned as a project manager their real abilities as opposed to their self propagated abilities immediately show through the veneer that cannot be hidden by a silk tie or a beautiful makeover leadership qualities and or weaknesses often become agonizingly obvious after only a few minutes those promoting themselves as top notch leaders are not always as strong when put into a real life leadership situation it is always easier to toot your own horn than to actually engage in leadership project managers even those on the winning teams often do not formulate a cohesive strategy they often believe that by diving off the deep end to complete the task at the first minute rather than taking a little time to organize and discuss how the task will be completed is more efficient more often than not members of an ill strategized team are running around like headless chickens figuring it out as they go along and in the long run they end up wasting far more time the winning team gets a taste of the high life such as eating dinner at an exclusive restaurant flying in a private jet and or meeting a celebrity the losing team comes to the dreaded board room where trump hears the lame excuses of the members and knocks off one or more of the contestants like pieces off a chess board with the now infamous you re fired often the project manager is held partially responsible for the team s loss and may be the target of trump s accusatory rhetoric every week at least one person becomes a casualty from the losing team my least favorite aspect of the apprentice is the board room while the tasks themselves bring out the strengths and weaknesses in the candidates the board room often brings out the worst unfortunately the rules of the game insist there is one winning team and one losing team even if the competition was close members of the losing team start accusing each other often ruthlessly about who was at fault and sometimes more than one person gets fired i seldom see an under performing candidate take responsibility for their actions in the board room kristi frank and kwame jackson were possibly the only candidates who took full responsibility for her team s losses and received no recognition for this selfless act for me kristi frank and kwame jackson had the most integrity of all the candidates however trump saw kristi as weak and fired her claiming she wasn t standing up for herself which may mean he values ego more than integrity no one should sacrifice their integrity for this kristi frank may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others unjustly isn t that worth as much as winning the strength of the apprentice is also its weakness because team performance is evaluated strictly by winners and losers other evaluation opportunities are overlooked barring huge gaps between the winning and losing teams sometimes a losing team exemplifies a high standard of teamwork and efficiency i have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team we americans are so often obsessed with winning and losing that we often overlook excellence 
i started watching the apprentice about years ago maybe and i really really liked it the first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format which though similar to a lot of other reality shows at its core is still very entertaining donald trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well the casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well but the best part of the show is new york city mark burnett may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handling of the cinematography is excellent as he makes nyc look like a character unto itself the jazz tunes coupled with some great camera work make new york look spectacular the apprentice will easily alway make my top reality shows of all time the amazing race is no however but just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in moderation if you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fast the same case as with tar star world the broadcasters in this country did a bang up job in presenting the show the first three seasons were shown in a row then after years the next two seasons were shown which kept the concept fresh in conclusion you will love this show especially the first seasons however if you keep watching the show continuously thereafter its charm will wear off and fast 
i work in a library and expected to like this movie when it came out years ago well i liked parker posey a lot she s a wonderful actress and omar townsend was really cute as her boyfriend he couldn t act but when you look like him who cares but the movie was bad it wasn t funny or cute or much of anything posey kept the movie afloat with her energy but she learned the dewey decimal system overnight and then shelves tons of books to the beat of music come on also i did have a problem with the way she looked when she became a full fledged librarian at the end hair in a bun glasses no sense of humor can we let that stereotype go please worth seeing for posey and townsend but that s about it the tv series was much better 
this is one of may all time favourite films parker posey s character is over the top entertaining and the librarian motif won t be lost on anyone who has ever worked in the books and stacks world if you re a library student rent this then buy the poster and hang it on your wall the soundtrack is highly recommendable too i ve shown this film to more library friends than any other they all fall in love with it 
this movie is brilliant the comments made before is from someone who obviously doesn t get it the movie is campy yes but it is uplifting and fun this movie is an underground hit and brings comparisons to absolutely fabulous it is a must see 
i remember parker posey on as the world turns before she became the queen of the independent movies in this film posey shows her potential as a top fledged actress in this film with supporting cast that includes omar townsend as moustafa a lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel salesman on the street who aspires to become a teacher the supporting cast features a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and only family relative as judy the librarian who is old fashioned dedicated and menopausal posey as mary learns that she has to grow up and mature losing her librarian clerk position makes her realize how much she misses it as a place in her life mary s life is surrounded by friends in the lower east side village of new york city before it became gentrified with yuppies this film is quite good for an independent and i have come to enjoy parker posey as mary as well as other characters in other films 
he he hello this is a really fun movie basically in party girl you have your fun lovin independent early s new yorker chick along with her party friends she meets a mature turkish vendor it is a comming of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do it is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a nack for throwing good parties on a side note parker posey makes this movie great i have never been a great fan of her but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies there are subtle manerisms that perfected her character if you want good laughs and a fun time make sure to watch this movie repeated viewings are a must 
this film is a delightful light hearted look at both sides of where the club kid rave scene blends with the new york art music and performance art worlds with a cameo by the omnipresent miss bunny this is torch song trilogy for the perky post teen girls that girl for our disaffected affected millennium times the dialogue is fast and funny and parker posey s costumer deserves if not an academy award at least a stadium wave of kudos of course this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of miss posey and she is perfectly cast like a lot of her acting work it may not be very deep it is often self referential and well posey but it all works she is a talented comedienne an incredible entertainer and this film entertains she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap and never lets it drop to the floor mary is a superficial party fashionista who isn t above stealing designer clothing from a friend s closet or making out with someone else s boyfriend on a deeper level this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care less in every sense of the word including about other people and the process of learning that caring is necessary to life the script is beautifully crafted witty and the only performance that disappoints is the aunt in a role that was much too one dimensional and heavy handed a more nuanced performance from her would have deepened the relationship between the two but hey this is comedy a surprisingly deep role that gives this film some substance and world vision is the fallafel selling boyfriend we should all be so lucky is he the one for mary or the one that gets away i rate this as a because it isn t a great moment of film history it is not a classic and it is not great art all of which get deeper and richer on re viewing like desperately seeking susan it represents something very true about it s time period but may become irrelevant with time still it has everything an entertaining film needs and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone 
 party girl capitalizes on the tremendous charm of parker posey in fact at times the movie seems to be a vehicle in which ms posey is allow to play herself as she normally is in real life the film directed by daisy von scherler mayer is a treat for ms posey s fans ms von scherler mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents this is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent meat market districts became at least there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way if we can call it that way parker posey makes an amazing mary it s because of parker posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played mary she is the whole picture the rest of the cast is good 
it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it s actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team there are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused pauline aquart is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much admires she s kind of odd looking she s not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs big feet and no derriere to speak of she s prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling adele haenel is older more well more developed physically what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit sauntering around teasing the boys swishing her long blond hair but she s not what she seems or is she i couldn t quite figure it out the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency no wonder francois is always sniffing after her there s not so much ambiguity in louse blachere s character she s on the team too but she s dumpy and plain and sensitive about it and has an intense crush on francois blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance the movie deals with the relationships between these three meaning intrigues deceptions hidden feelings and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another this is of course a tricky topic it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on and what little sex there is under the covers sometimes literally i don t think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much partly because it s suggestive rather than expressed through action partly because it s complex and partly because i m not sure i got it all let me give an example okay adele is the girl the others envy she s also quite distant and self satisfied on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys a superior and self indulgent narcissist you know but then the soi disant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she s still a virgin really yes really pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she d like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her pauline now drawn sexually to adele performs the task with subdued relish now adele would really like to get it on with a man preferably older and experienced so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room the two girls stand there staring at one another neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins reaches up and kisses adele on the lips adele steps back smiling and says there now that wasn t so bad was it and then walks back into the club that s a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele but what the hell is going on initially adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child later like a close friend finally like a potential lover and the minute pauline responds adele walks off satisfied is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude i don t know i ve slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity but i ve only skipped her for considerations of space should you see it by all means just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids for men some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot 
water lilies is a well made first film from france about young female sexuality and friendship sciamma works with specialized slightly sanitized material that is as off putting to some as it is alluring to others the film focuses exclusively on three middle class teenage girls in a tidy new paris suburb their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team such distractions as parents siblings work and school have been neatly excised from the equation the central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny marie pauline acquart who is not on the team but thinks she would like to be marie worships floriane ad le haenel an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after this takes marie away from her former best friend also a member of the water ballet team the somewhat plump anne louise blach re being less special anne is more truly accessible to the boys floriane like this film promises a bit more then she truly offers marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl she suffers inwardly flroiane doesn t so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as floriane floriane takes advantage of this to make marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations then lacking any other friends her confidante all the other girls think floriane a slut an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases because it leads them on she suffers the pretty girl s fate of being not a person but an object and she can t resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her but she doesn t really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are a trap enlisting marie to act as her pal so her unseen mother won t know she s going out to meet boys she also gets marie to rescue her from the boys later it looked the opposite at first but floriane needs marie as much as marie thinks she needs her anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid that s earthier and more real than the other girls keeping all external context at bay sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls goals and interactions on the other hand the film s water madness which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its minutes do not pass so quickly luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever present goals and avoidances and just do silly pointless girl things it s the offbeat moments that give the film life too bad in a way that there aren t more of them but sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls who understandably love to gaze at themselves there s no great revelation or drama on the way but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that marie doesn t just admire but truly desires floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends whom floriane always stops before they go all the way in a typical irony of this kind of plot floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with marie but marie is the one who holds off because she knows it won t have the significance to floriane that it will have to her when it happens it s a timid mechanical affair meanwhile anne has a huge crush on francois warren jacquin a male swimmer but of course he is after floriane boys are not an element that s been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor but they are just bodies and faces available studs 
the significance of french title of this film la naissance des pieuvres which literally means the birth of the octopuses is rather obscure so it is perhaps not surprising that it has been marketed in english speaking countries as water lilies the lilies of the english title are three teenage girls marie anne and floriane who are members of a synchronised swimming team based in the paris suburbs and the film is a coming of age drama about the development of their first sexual feelings one feature of the film perhaps unusual for a film of this type is that it concentrates exclusively on relationships between the young people themselves we see nothing of their parents or their teachers and very little of the adult world at all the three girls are very different in appearance and are portrayed as being very different in character the shy retiring marie is slim and petite and appears to be the youngest of the three anne is something of a plain jane floriane a glamorous blonde who is very popular with the boys the three together with a handsome male swimmer named francois are involved in what might be described as a love quadrilateral anne has fallen in love with francois but he is smitten with floriane who seems to return his affections although he is by no means her only male admirer indeed not all of floriane s admirers are male because marie has a crush on her attractive friend the film charts the way in which their friendship develops at first it seems that floriane is simply using marie as a convenient excuse when she is in fact going out to meet boys her parents presumably object to her dating boys but have no objection to her going out with female friends later however we realise that despite floriane s image as the sexy popular girl who is always the centre of male attention she actually reciprocates marie s feelings the film reverses some conventional stereotypes about sexuality anne with her short hair and rather chunky figure looks typically butch yet she is the only one of the three main characters who is unambiguously heterosexual whereas the more conventionally feminine marie and the glamorous floriane are lesbian or at least bisexual coming of age films are common enough although most of them tend to avoid the controversial topic of teenage lesbianism water lilies however deals with its subject matter in a sensitive way with three very good performances from its three leading actresses pauline acquart adele haenel and louise blachere the relationships between the characters especially that between marie and floriane are complex and capable of a number of interpretations is floriane for example simply using marie for sex or does she genuinely have romantic feelings for her could floriane s sluttish behaviour with francois and the other boys be just a device to hide her lesbian feelings from the outside world or even to hide them from herself this was the first film made by its young director celine sciamma only at the time on this basis she must be regarded as a highly promising newcomer 
the original title means the birth of the octopuses i must confess that i do not quite understand this title the english title is water lilies but after having written this i read the comment by another user the title in french is also suggestive prieuve or octopus suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously thanks for your explanation the basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls when it is not clear if they are directed toward the same or the other sex it is no different for boys i think that both floriane and marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any admixtures much of the movie is water ballet sometimes the girls will have their heads downwards and nothing above the water except their feet and lowers legs with which they will wave and kick in the air to people like me who had never seen such things before it was fascinating floriane is the leader of one team of water lilies marie tells her that she would like to see when floriane is training this seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary soon they will walk together floriane takes marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her and then goes away with him for an hour while marie is waiting for her to return i took for granted that the couple slept with each other but we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that i can supply some information which few users will find elsewhere there is a scene in which marie secretly steals floriane s garbage bag in it she finds an apple mostly eaten and marie proceeds to eat the rest there is a parallel scene in another movie kazetachi no gogo afternoon breezes by hitoshi yazaki japan this is about adult young females and a clearly lesbian woman is vainly in love with a heterosexual woman she also steals a garbage bag of the beloved and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest later floriane tells marie that she would like to have her first orgasm from her marie says she cannot do this but still later marie says that she is indeed willing to do it and she masturbates on floriane there is no nudity in this scene probably only a female director could have made such a fine psychological show or study of i would like to quote baudelaire les amours enfantines floriane is played by ad le haenel who made the excellent performance as the autistic girl in the little devils by christophe ruggia a very underrated movie 
also known as water lilies this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex this story is told at a slow pace and that works very well it gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow somewhat attached to them using a small cast puts some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen time than normal but the people playing in this film handle that well everyone is completely believable visual setting is great especially the underwater shots in the swimming pool add a nice effect many films have been made about the same subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them it pulls some standard pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them it isn t bad not at all but it surely isn t great either and i do feel it could have done better if it had taken some what less explored angles out of synchronous swimmers
i saw it at cinema mk hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in paris a very pretty film about three years old teenagers all of them just at about the same psychologically stages many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age our first feelings about sexual relations it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism but even in that case she doesn t corrupt the likelihood of the story you can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere i fund the young actresses of talent special mention with floriane and marie very convincing there are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is impressing 
three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relation the base of the triangle is barely there at the apex is marie a serious short and lean tomboy with a belmondo like facial structure her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite coquette chubby i dare say fat and desirous for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter because of her chubbiness boys don t seem interested and it pains her the other leg of the apex is a beautiful fille fatale blonde vamp she is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at competitive level marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool marie insinuates herself into the life of the vamp using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument the vamp has a reputation of being a whore making out with any young male that orbits around her marie is not phased out by that reputation put a stress on reputation the first half is set up we get to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls eventually the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the topsy turvy relations among the three that s when unexpected things start to happen it is a trademark of french films to drop nuggets of wisdom on the viewer this one is no exception here it is about ceilings and the dying see the film to learn more the director says that the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful that women only sport is a metaphor for a girl s life pretty and feminine on the surface while hard working and competitive underneath a number of scenes drive this point elegant moves and smiles for the public legs kicking ungainly underwater the title in french is also suggestive prieuve or octopus suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously 
the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner director john bud cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds moreover cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus jim davis as hearty patriarch grant williams dorothy malone as his cheery wife ana christopher mitchum as the concerned richard marcy lafferty as his lovely wife beth natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny and scott c kolden as the gutsy steve the funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures neat stop motion animation monsters said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy a big lumpy fanged beast and a scrawny lizard dude and nifty matte paintings richard band s rousing full bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot john arthur morrill s crisp sunny cinematography likewise does the trick a fun flick 
i don t understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey he has never been a very interesting film actor the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo definitely not stock types although one can t say their characters are well developed that doesn t make them any less funny the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog so that was certainly not a problem the use of spanish gives it more authenticity a very underrated movie judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a at least a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting 
this one s a romp many trek fans don t rate this as high as the well known all time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones but this one is so well executed for what it is so successful as pure entertainment it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes no matter what mood i m in several well known future movies westworld and tv shows the more bland fantasy island took their cue from the premise of this episode then of course the tng show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology beautifully filmed especially evident in the restored version and on dvd and directed it takes place in the nice park like setting of a planet which the enterprise has just arrived to it s odd that no animal life even insects seems to exist here how are flowers pollinated for example but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past kirk has a people heavy past it turns out as well as figures from other well known fantasy stories sulu even finds an old style police revolver adding to his collection of swords no doubt by this point in the trek series halfway thru the first season the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we d come to know over the many proceeding years here we get to really see them relax converse and work together to figure out this episode s puzzle the strong narrative is a mystery again of sorts and the audience is along for the ride as kirk friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them it s almost whimsical following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue the enterprise had it s suggested just completed a harrowing mission then dr mccoy is killed by a knight on horseback yes this is dr mccoy s final episode just kidding but it s no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story mccoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and like the best trek episodes the nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic more desperate tempo of action and suspense this is all signaled by kirk s resolute response to sulu who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after mccoy s death kirk will get to the bottom of all this come what may but it doesn t get much easier for kirk what follows is probably the longest staged mano a mano fight for the series as kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet yet this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness with another of kirk s past acquaintances this episode runs the gamut of all human experience rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet it s gratifying that the script really does explain all of what s happened as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy sci fi series with similar plot lines unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there and there actually is a subtext to the story that we humans need to work off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion or we just don t function in a normal natural way also note the appearance of the very cute yeoman barrows and the sudden absence of yeoman rand who did not return until the first trek movie in i believe that after this episode even more trek fans couldn t wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters but i leave this episode with a final perhaps tantalizing thought if mccoy was killed verified by spock how do we know it was our real mccoy who beamed back up to the ship perhaps this explains why this mccoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with data 
 shore leave is mostly an average star trek adventure nothing wrong with the episode though i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans it is lightweight entertaining nothing more however i m glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts in this episode kirk decides to grant his crew some time off and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation as usual the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be there are some action and tense moments but most of the story is played for laughs good but unexceptional 
another episode from childhood that as an adult i look back on with a different perspective this was one of my favorite childhood episodes one that really cemented my adoration of this show however on viewing this episode after years i d say it is definitely one of the lighter ones played for laughs and amusement instead of the dramatic and well constructed story lines in previous episodes in this their first and best season perhaps this episode was written for a little fan r r too as mr spock would say the story just isn t logical but there are some amusing lines like of course mr spock s final one at the end when he asks the captain mccoy et al whether they enjoyed their r r and they answer in the affirmative he raises an eyebrow and says fascinating in only the way mr spock could do that an interesting story line of course the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing instead of the fake and often annoying amusement of disneyland for example being able to have one s wishes actually come true really a great idea but not that well executed and coming from theodore sturgeon another of the great sf short story writers they used in the first season one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that sturgeon turned in now here is a little trivia i learned on this very site in james gunn established the theodore sturgeon award for best short science fiction story and i ll quote the rest from this site in he sturgeon wrote the joy machine a third script for the star trek tv series amok time the other that was never shot the main reason that it wasn t used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget however the script was adapted into a book by sci fi writer james gunn star trek the original series and published by pocket books in i d sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable especially if one doesn t think too much about it just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe 
this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun but i appreciated this light hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level think about it the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland a bengal tiger a samurai warrior a knight on horseback who kills mccoy and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don t make any sense at all until the very end despite all the danger you just can t take everything very seriously it s just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal so on a purely non aesthetic level it s great stuff 
first of all riget is wonderful good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time nice combination of strange dogma style of telling the story together with good music and great actors but unfortunately there s no the end as for me it s unacceptable i was thinking how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse and i have some idea i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different i m sure that rd part without helmer wouldn t be the same so here s my suggestion mayble little bit stupid maybe not i know that lars likes to experiment so why not to make small experiment with riget i think the only solution here is to create puppet driven animation like for example team america by trey parker or even computer d animation i know it s not the same as real actors but in principle i believe it could work only this way it s possible to make actors alive again for riget fans this shouldn t be so big difference if the animation will be done in good way average watcher will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie the most important thing now is the story it s completely understandable that it s not possible to create riget with the actors nowadays so why not to play with animation and look for the possibilities that it gives to you even marketing one great director finishes his trilogy after years using puppet animation just dreams i hope to see riget someday or even to see just the script i m curious how the story ends and as i expect everybody here do greets slaj ps i m not talking about the kingdom hospital by stephen king 
the production quality cast premise authentic new england waterbury ct locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a star collectors item unfortunately all we got was a passable star decent flick mostly memorable for what it tried to do bring an art house style film mainstream the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself and if well done will satisfy most grownups jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable i wondered why she wasn t doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury robert diniro s character was just a bit too contrived an illiterate nice guy loser who turns out to actually be with a little help from jane s character a version of henry ford or thomas edison this genre has been more successfully handled by nobody s fool in the mid s and this year s about schmidt i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts i ll give it an a for effort 
bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this shore leave is really tos first attempt at lightweight sci fi which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of for example the corbomite manouever looking for a place to chill out for a while the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place some seemingly perilous but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery mccoy has gone through the looking glass psychological thriller kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past and romantic comedy no comment tos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy handed potentially calamitous drama unlike later series franchise writers tos production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before and shore leave despite its occasional problems is an example my only criticism of this episode is that the cast particularly shatner ironic given his legendary sense of humor didn t seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on st s themes the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run both compositionally and in terms of acting nuff said my recommendation see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen it order 
paul verhoeven genius and master film maker strikes back with the less than perfect yet still fun in a dirty old man type of way hollow man the first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints yet i am giving a recommendation to this film for it s mind blowing special effects perhaps the best so far around and two dandy performances by the leads verhoeven s moral questions are of course thought provoking and although the film turned off many this movie is pretty soft core for old verhoeven two major flaws josh brolin aka walking ape man and the whole deal with the elevator if there was an access ladder why were they trapped down in the lab a fun horror film for a saturday night 
hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr sebastian caine kevin bacon finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla it works perfectly caine his team of assistant s celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human he manages to persuade his team to help him the procedure works well caine becomes invisible however when they try to bring him back the serum fails he remain invisible the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory but then again he s invisible right he can do anything he wants directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man you know it s just after christmas i saw this a few hours ago on late night early morning cable tv worst of all i feel sick not because of the film but because of the chocolates fizzy pop i ve had over the past week so i ll keep this one brief the script by andrew w marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle has a good central premise it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror sci fi action provide good entertainment value for odd minutes i thought the character s were ok i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it s generally known that verhoeven doesn t deal in subtlety the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification who s going to know that caine says to himself then of course there s the gore he shows a rat being torn apart that s just the opening scene after the credits to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty sadistic tone about it having said that i love horror gore exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me it s just that it might not be everyone s cup of tea director verhoeven does a great job or should that be the special effects boys make him look good the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular more or less flawless their brilliant it s as simple straight forward as that there s some good horror action set pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over the top i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins organs bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla there s a few gory moments including a rat being eaten someone is impaled on a spike someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results with a staggering budget of about hollow man is technically faultless i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon s entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn t they the acting was ok bacon made for a good mad scientist anti hero type guy hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character s but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film well i know i do good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier darker streak than the usual hollywood product definitely worth a watch 
it seems a lot of imdb comments on this film are biased in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version true hollow man is a remake of sorts of the invisible man but that s where the similarities end hollow man is an entertaining movie period if you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible then you shouldn t watch movies in the first place true some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable but hollow man manages to entertain and make you think what you would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends kevin bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who along with a team of collaborators discover the way to make animals invisible now his mission is to make them visible again when this team of young scientists working as you might guess for the pentagon think they have the formula for making animals visible again kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug after that of course things go wrong as kevin bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask so his collaborators know where he is feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over kevin s character and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend and collaborator elisabeth shue is having a torrid affair with another of the young scientists in the team he finally snaps the movie then turns into a hybrid of alien and a slasher flick but that s not saying it s a bad turn there are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace the special effects are top notch a quality always prevalent in all of paul verhoeven s films as we get to see some body reconstitution sequences never seen on a movie before if there s anything to complain about perhaps is the predictability of the situations herein by the first hour of the movie you know kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end and the ending is a bit abrupt but despite this hollow man is still worth watching if you want to know what a truly bad movie is then waste your money on fear dot com with stephen dorf or the even worse the untold or sasquatsh with land henriksen now that is hollow out of 
greetings again from the darkness stunning photography highlights this disney documentary and provides a glimpse into some of the harshness of animals that live in the wilderness for anyone over disney and mutual of omaha s wild kingdom provided much of our insight into wild animals since our childhood back when there was no channel dedicated to national geographic or nature or animal planet what always fascinates is just how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures watching the elephants trudge for days nearly delirious from lack of water is oh so painful but their nighttime battle against the lions is thrilling some of the underwater shots are breathless the mama and baby humpbacks are beautiful and watching the great white shark attack its prey is every bit as chilling as jaws the most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the himalayas i had never seen such detail of the vastness of the range don t think most young kids today will be too excited by this one but it surely is one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries i have ever seen 
in the ampas awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting wildlife in the coldest place on earth that film was march of the penguins narrated by academy award winning actor morgan freeman walt disney studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now they ve taken their stabs at live action film making and it s been hit and miss all across the board disney then created a sub division called disneynature and release its first feature film titled earth this is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries i ve seen in quite sometime narrated by the great james earl jones earth doesn t offer anything new to anyone who has watched the discovery channel in the past five years or follows the global warming crisis very closely earth touches very deeply on the issue and takes a very liberal approach on the subject matter it enables an emotional connection to nature that i haven t experienced before it also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our gorgeous planet but the grunt and disturbing aspects that it often entails it s one thing to watch mufasa fall from a cliff in to a stampede or bambi s mother be shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods it s all good because at the end of the film we know it is just that a film this shows penguins polar bears elephants all types of families from all walks of life living and dying in their natural habitats these real things make a real movie experience though a bit heavy weight on the graphic nature of the film which many people will disagree earth is a touching experience there is stunning cinematography work here by a great camera team and an amazing score by george fenton in comparison to march of the penguins or grizzly man it doesn t really hold any measure but it stands great on its own at the end of the day you grow an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness as many of us will probably never get to visit these places we ll witness in the film we live here yet it s like we never get to explore the planet for one reason or another earth is beautiful 
earth is a must see for children and adults my son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears we can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth there are some animals in danger to disappear exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet this documentary offers many exceptional pictures that i have never seen before then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music the director did a great job here that gets high respect nothing can stop me and my family to give earth the highest rate i hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel 
i saw this movie with my family and it was great this film is more than just a documentary that offers not more than cold facts with long mono duologue s and lots of charts the complete power of this movie comes from the impressive pictures being filmed under water in the air or the arctic with watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than with just reading a book it shows that we are embedded in the circular flow of life this movie is not only for environmental fanatics although people that want to look a good movie with a message should watch it this movie taught me that we are not only living on the earth we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us 
this is a run of the mill nature porn movie by porn i don t mean sex i mean gratuitous images of for example thousands of birds together or hundreds of walruses or a giant waterfall or iceberg several of the shots in the film seem to exist solely to make their way into the trailer to get people into theatres to see it for all of ten seconds before it disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the film there is almost no plot in this film told to expect a story of three animal families better than march of the penguins the movie simply doesn t deliver the blame rests in three key areas the writers who gave james earl jones some of the worst lines to narrate in nature film history the music team who over dramatized everything to tell you what you should be feeling even when the film fails to motivate and lastly but most importantly the editors who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason no continuity no flow sucking the life out of the entire film a film about life when we got to the whales halfway through the film i sunk back in my seat with dread hoping against hope that the film was more than halfway through and that i d be able to survive the long endurance test along with the animals on screen there was also almost no science in the film at all they attributed hot and cold all of it not just the seasons solely to the earth s tilt ignoring the fact that we d have even greater extremes from location to location if there was no tilt because the poles would never warm and it would be worst if we had no rotation relative to revolution like mercury because half the planet would bake and the other half would freeze then near the end they used the phrase humans and animals as if humans are not animals somehow exempt from the laws of nature so much for science i must credit the camera work however and again that is why i call this nature porn everything from super slow motion to what appears to be a finely tuned mechanically controlled time lapse photography was put to use to provide some and i caution only some stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films that said i am not convinced that it was all nature on the screen some of the shots showing the great watering hole in africa as it changed from season to season seemed like cgi to me a director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that it s all natural but they didn t do that for a film about earth i had expected a lot more of earth to be shown what we saw was pristine we had to take the narrator s word for it that some species are at risk due to climate changes they didn t show us evidence of it they didn t show us alberta s poisonous tailing ponds visible from space they didn t show us the great pacific trash whorl they didn t show us a nighttime picture of human light pollution around the planet these are as much earth as anything else why cover it up for a feel good whitewash my last criticism of the content is of predation any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey the music turned almost into that mt doom scene from lord of the rings with the predator portrayed as some kind of sauron ultimate evil character but predators aren t evil they perform a necessary service ensuring that the best members of the prey species survive we are predators ourselves any time the predator caught the prey we immediately cut away to something else to sort of pretend that death and eating don t really happen the final insult was the dad polar bear being left to die after he dared to try to eat bad bear bad you can almost hear them say on to the presentation itself my theatre may be in part to blame for this but maybe not i had expected to see something with greater clarity than i could see on my own hdtv lcd at home but the picture was blurry and was presented in the same ratio i could get at home instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days and during one action packed scene near the end the film i can t imagine this happening digitally from how it looked was damaged and we lost several of the colors eventually blacking out completely that repeated about three times if they actually do plant a tree on my behalf it will have been worth it but how will i know 
the spoiler warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and landscapes pass before their eyes although i don t mention it in great detail earth is an approx minute cinema version based on planet earth which i watched all on bbc tv the tv version was narrated by david attenborough a captivating commentator who i had wished had also done it for earth but it is patrick stewart star trek s captain picard there are regularly shots of the earth from space so that s may be appropriate in any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it there are chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from north pole to antarctica animal families polar bear elephant and whale appear in more than one of these parts each chapter starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is we see something of each kind of animal but only mammals and birds and some fish and some beautiful shots of vegetation mountains waterfalls deserts and jungle a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and climates on earth you get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals people or villages or cities aren t in the film so it s a typical nature documentary but breathtakingly shot and accompanied by delightful music when the film opened i already knew it would end far too soon for me it is a family film so no brutal killings of any animals when one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it s shot in slow motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children age limit in the netherlands no blood is shed some scenes newly born animals are really cute and will be adored by kids it looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty it had it s dutch premiere yesterday a month before the actual release in a cinema of seats of which were taken true beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers it seems as i knew the tv series i was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie some didn t but the most impressive shots big waterfalls did luckily it was the first time i ever cried in a nature film 
you have to see it to believe it directors alastair fothergill and mark linfield have done a thing really great it is a out of so i can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie with people love scenes and so on i am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet finally it has nothing to do with al gore s documentary movie an inconvenient truth mainly made of long monologues painfully and with truths not always accurate as many scientists have pointed already the best thing you can do on earth is not miss earth 
there is some spectacular heart stoppingly beautiful photography here of a range of scenery and animals from arctic to tropical and everything in between the camera techniques are varied and spot on from close ups to aerial work editing is tremendous and the commentary is spot on too with just the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world where the film falls down a bit is in trying to cover and integrate four themes seasonal patterns climate change individual animal stories and hunter hunted interactions across multiple environments eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed overall well worth seeing especially given the issues covered but don t expect oscar material 
this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see i thought it was just another documentary but it really is something else it doesn t try to teach you anything it shows you how life works in nature i won t talk about the quality of the pictures because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched earth is funny tense and sad it can make you laugh it can make you cry sometimes both at the same time this is the first movie that made me cry not because you feel sorry for the animals but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with yet we don t appreciate it one bit this movie should be shown obligatory in schools it is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it who knows maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this but i would easily rate it more if it were possible 
i was really looking forward too seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a must see movie for people that love movies about nature the movie shows different climates and the animals associated with them by starting at the north pole and going down south as the movie progresses the footage from this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and i many times wondered how on earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky however beautiful a large part of the footage i had already seen in the tv series planet earth narrated by david attenborough i found attenborough s narration of planet earth to be much better than the narration of earth earth is an easier movie it skips much of the scientific detail that attenborough covers in his planet earth series for instance earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale because there are few predators planet earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery because the water is low in oxygen and doesn t contain enough nutrients to support very large animals like large sharks etc to me that s an important difference that together with attanborough s far superior voice make planet earth a far better documentary than earth still however i think earth is worth watching for the beautiful footage and the fact that it s easier to understand makes it interesting for children too 
kept my attention from start to finish great performances added to this tremendous film mr pacino once again gives us another brilliant character to enjoy 
we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was born to play al pacino stars as new york s mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this movie i understand that i can t name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays but that s not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to see also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and david paymer 
in a performance both volatile and graceful al pacino re teams with sea of love director harold becker as new york mayor john pappas in city hall a savvy thriller thats the first film ever shot inside the lower manhattan structure that s ground zero for the city s government that the other nyc locations provide the vivid settings as an idealistic mayoral aide john cusack follows a trail of subversion and cover up that may loop back to the man he serves and reveres bridget fonda danny aiello martin landau tony franciosa and david paymer add more starry brilliance to this gripping tale of power and the power behind power 
city hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country state or any sort of major political table granted it shines on new york city which is a huge political arena especially nowadays but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor s right hand director harold becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done mercury rising malice and domestic disturbance and i think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault i mean city hall is meant to be a political drama not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out what else or rather who else al pacino the film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city as the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city as events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up i absolutely hate talking about al pacino i mean even if once he didn t give a good performance how could i ever say it the man is acting royalty there is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor in city hall pacino plays the new york city mayor he has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician he also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches i ve ever seen at the james bone funeral i re watched that speech four times and the first time i watched pacino give it my mouth gaped open and i almost wanted to stand up and applaud its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by pacino john cusack who i really do enjoy as an actor turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy mayor kevin calhoun he is kind of the focus of the film and him and pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance he seems like he s trying too hard his accent is just bizarre and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he doesn t get seem to pull it off maybe he was having an off film bridget fonda on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows marybeth cogan her performance is very similar to cusack s in that she just doesn t seem to find her groove with this character danny aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia frank anselmo martin landau makes a decent cameo as judge under scrutiny walter stern the problem with city hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors everyone is okay there is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy and of course you have al pacino in a rather small supporting role but he s absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film it almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them so city hall could have been this huge political epic drama thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one but it still has to be seen for pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics if you just won t see this movie than find pacino s speech at james bone funeral because the word electrifying doesn t seem to give it justice but you can see what makes al pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it if you re a john cusack fan which i am he s definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice a decent movie but unfortunately potential loss 
the film concerns a classic theme in fact it concerns the theme exploited by batman from beginning to end but in real data and details the mayor of new york appreciated and very diligent and dynamic in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he pressurizes the judge in his turn to set him free on probation in spite of a negative probation report that disappears but is not destroyed be it only because of the political value it represents and what was to happen happens and a few people including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal the city may explode because of it racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the insecurity such criminals free to roam around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public unluckily the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out but along the way a few witnesses are killed and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to retire the judge to end their career and life the contractor or the contractor s go between a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared probation report and some shady character after he provides some crucial information the mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation but the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case the political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions we are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest we are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city that is not typical of new york that is true in any mayoral office it is just more significant in quantity and in quality in a big metropolitan area like new york and of course in a city or country where police departments are municipal and are controlled by political imperatives the young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way and he derails his ambition to be the governor of new york in order to become the president of the us the mayor is perfect due to the embodiment al pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless i find the end slightly mushy with the ex deputy mayor campaigning in his own name that seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out of his own way hence he is not better than all the others just still too young in his ambition dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
working from a script written in part by nicholas pileggi best known for writing the book wiseguy which he adapted into the movie goodfellas and for writing the book and screenplay casino director harold becker shows how connected circles scratch each other s backs even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like pappas who is regarded as a presidential prospect as cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster s probation report his skepticism is agitated how did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence we meet the other players in the plot not the least of which is danny aiello the political boss of brooklyn and tony franciosa the mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead how and why these people are affiliated i leave to the movie to divulge though there are never any misgivings that they are the narrative is told generally through the eyes of the cusack character a visionary from louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite but considering i just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge one can t say it doesn t work the shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor s desk a charge by aiello for a subway stop and an off ramp in brooklyn to aid a new banking center and the city s bid for the next democratic convention individual idiosyncrasies are also explored including aiello s emotional bond with the music of rogers and hammerstein much also is made of menschkeit a yiddish expression which pappas explains to his deputy is about the bond of honor between two men about what happens between the two hands in a handshake this connection doesn t mean much to bridget fonda the lawyer for the policeman s association who defends the dead cop s honor and fights for his widow s pension even as incriminating evidence appears little by little the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law there are various scenes of hard impact including one where the brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked and then the mafia boss drops in by surprise there is also a compelling and markedly conjectural late scene between the mayor and his deputy one scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayor s decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child in a harlem church his advisers tell him he won t be wanted there but he goes anyway and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole pacino and his character both it gets an impressive reaction from the congregation but the mayor knows and his deputy knows that it was artificial and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it in the limousine taking them away is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo this is a script that knows it has to supply pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech pacino and cusack are convincing together throughout the movie the older man unbreakable and aware the younger one anxious to learn but with ideals that don t sway pacino is innate with his down to earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination inspired flair and matter of fact realism cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness the bridget fonda subplot development is unnecessary but it is a result of veteran screenwriter paul schrader s otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments aiello for instance is a highlight because he evokes his character s joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment 
has al pacino ever been in a bad movie his name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema this is as good a performance as he s ever given pacino is an american olivier and this is a political thriller as good as they get there are no good guys and no bad guys but the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they re running it not only is pacino s performance compelling the eulogy at the dead child s funeral is awesomely powerful the film has a fast paced gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks this outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence overheated sex or gutter language there is murder there are bad people but they come across effectively without crossing the line a film like this restores my jaded faith in hollywood i don t award many tens this one richly deserves it 
i read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred went ahead and started watching i admit that i had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex involved and full of detail that is a good thing but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases explosions gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development in fact what a welcome departure however i am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what i watch this film is chock full of character development and plot line the kind that we used to analyze when i was in high school it requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer what a nice change i would compare it to all the president s men in terms of generic subject matter that is it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially own them unlike all the president s men this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality in this sense the movie is a character study like the negotiatior with samuel jackson and kevin spacey in that movie their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense yet the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other trust each and ultimately unite together against the corrupt police department there is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically there are many similarities i will say that city hall requires a whole lot more concentration in fact i was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals i ve seen in my life going back to watergate the thing is the public knows that something is wrong for sure but following the details is hard to do this movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity i think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film unrealistic expectations if one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience it really is excellent i watched it times in a row the acting is superb and the directing is flawless the weakest link is john cusak s accent 
wow more hours of riget lars continues the great combination of occult dark horror and soap opera drama picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left off complete with the same high intensity and suspense though that doesn t last for better or worse this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste in the last series there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode whereas in this it clearly is one long stretch where one episode ends the next begins a lot can be said about lars von trier but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric both qualities show in this the plot continues its excellence now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention basically every character from the first returns at least as far as the main roles go the pacing isn t as sharp as in the first part and i found myself less gripped by this one that is not in any kind of way to say that this didn t involve me though i still found myself constantly watching and at several points reacting strongly often out loud to what was going on extremely unusual behavior for me as i am an incredibly silent person as i also was during the first like the first this also brings up some loaded ethical questions building on the foundation from the first this brings the story further and being a sequel the scope is also bigger grander more spirits more bizarre occurrences more subplots the strong graphic material of the first also returns and it s been kicked up a notch the characters are developed further the acting is amazing as that of the first udo kier solidifies his immense talent to anyone who doubted it playing a very difficult character anyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what i mean and acting in a language he didn t speak he was later dubbed and still handing in such a strong performance the cinematography remains great and is still very hand held with rapid zooms and the occasional long take the editing is sharp with a few direct cuts in sound though these were more prominent in the first now with all that said i would really like to be able to rate this a perfect or at least just under like the first four episodes i truly enjoyed watching and i don t regret it in the least but this does have shortcomings the ones the first part had and more as the first the humor just takes up too much space and this time around it s even worse there are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief three of them no less scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh fine for a comedy but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant yes nothing short of sadistic at times horror piece helmer s solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof from which he could see his beloved sweden to a bathroom with an angle from inside the bowl no you read that right in general the humor seems more low brow more sex and bodily function jokes which again begs the question why whilst most of the writing is excellent some of it is downright dire several scenes are basically copied from the first mini series one would guess due to their popularity when it aired at times the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first and it jumps too much at times fortunately seldom but still noticeably plot points and items are explained away too easily a certain character living in denmark for no apparent reason for example anyone who s seen it knows who i m speaking of the two dishwashers while still mysterious and insightful become too much of a gimmick too overexposed in the end i guess most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable though in addition to that i want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things i have just written that this is still mostly good definitely enjoyable compelling powerful and in my humble opinion it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first though if belong in that group do not expect to feel that the story is finished after watching this any more than you did after the first i recommend this to any fan of lars von trier and anyone who enjoyed the first riget and wants more where that came from i urge anyone who s even considering watching this to make sure you ve seen all of the first before you do i bought this before i bought the first but i held out on watching until i had bought the first and watched that and i can t tell you how glad i am that i did though this features a brief summary of the events in the first there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didn t see it before watching this slightly lesser sequel but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first 
excellent political thriller played much quieter and slower than other higher ranking films in this genre when people talk about pacino and cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performances a story of friendships father son relationships corruption and deceit the two actors gel amazingly well together and the supports from aiello and fonda are equally as impressive although aiello is brilliant especially when the papers run to press instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political bribery the final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted 
being a transplanted new yorker i might be more critical than most in watching city hall but i have to say that before even getting to the story itself i was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of new york city that director harold becker created for example there s a reference to woerner s restaurant in brooklyn where political boss frank anselmo likes to eat there is or was a woerner s restaurant on remsen street in downtown brooklyn when i lived in new york back in it was in fact particularly favored by political people in the borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts no surprise because the script was co authored by nicholas pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories he knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film a detective played by nestor serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss anthony franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead including an innocent year old boy whose father was walking him to school the story mushrooms and at the end it s reached inside city hall itself al pacino plays mayor john pappas and john cusack is his deputy mayor a transplanted louisianan a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself he s the outsider here and in trying to do damage control cusack finds more than he bargained for danny aiello plays brooklyn political boss frank anselmo and for those of you not from new york his character is based on the late borough president of queens donald manes who was also brought down by scandal he s very much the kind of brooklyn politician i knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them do aiello in city hall was the farewell performance on film for anthony franciosa one of the most underrated and under appreciated talents ever on the screen no one watches anyone else whenever he s on al pacino s best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself his is a complex part he s a decent enough man but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like new york for those who want to know about political life in the big apple city hall is highly recommended 
i had been long awaiting this movie ever since i saw the trailer which made it look like a political drama starring three of my favorite actors al pacino john cusack and bridget fonda and even though it was directed by harold becker who has done uneven work he and pacino did combine on sea of love which ranks among each of their best work but interference on some level for starters several of the scenes in the original trailer don t appear in the movie and changing of tone subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller make this while watchable nowhere near as it could have been which is too bad because i really wanted to like this movie there was great potential here to be a film about how government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption and to make a complex statement about that corruption not the usual good guys vs bad guys and there is good acting here pacino and cusack are both very good and danny aiello gives one of the best performances of his career but fonda is wasted in her role having nothing to do and while there is merit in the central storyline when it turns to a thriller the movie loses its way briefly recovers in the final scene between cusack and pacino and then falls down completely in the end i wish i could like this more but no 
documentaries of this kind are often very opinionated this film seems to take all opinions out and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided it is sad the conditions these poor people have to work in this film does a great job of showing the ugly side of sweat shops the film mardi gras made in china was a good way of showing the world how something as petty as beads for a celebration can effect the lives of so many people in another country i had to watch this film for an english class where we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this film helped get the topic rolling it was a great very informative movie and i d recommend anyone see it it kinda opens your eyes 
sharp well made documentary focusing on mardi gras beads i have always liked this approach to film making communicate ideas about a larger more complex and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home i am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism and globalism s effect on poorer nations however people feel about it rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox not that there s anything wrong with that other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted this documentary simply shows mardi gras beads how they are manufactured by what people and under what conditions and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process it openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process including workers factory management american importers and finally the consumer at the end of the chain i felt a little sickened by this equally by the mardi gras revelers but also by the way the workers in china have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed the footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end made a particular impression but that was just my reaction i can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently unlike other documentaries on this subject i don t think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this this is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume if you have ever bought a product made in the far east this should give you something to think about outstanding and highly recommended need to see more documentaries like this kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film 
wow wow wow i have never seen a non preachy documentary on globalization until i saw mardi gras made in china this film has zero narration and combines verite footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in china who live inside a factory compound they play with toys jump rope and dance yet the majority of their days and nights consist of work work and work but the footage of their work is illuminating and mesmerizing to watch the owner of the factory in china is amazingly open so much so that he hits home the effects of globalization while he punishes the workers astutely following mardi gras beads from china to the carnival the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting compelling footage from both cultures one of the most interesting parts in this film is the cross cultural introduction of factory workers and mardi gras revelers to each other through pictures here the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation the film is never preachy is not guilt driven and allows everyone s point of view to be present at the end we the viewers make up our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and globalization 
sequel to the kingdom is bloodier and even more twisted i only saw half i was exhausted and couldn t sit through all hours but i loved what i saw ghosts blood murder poisoning mutated babies voodoo this has it all if you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you also you don t have to see part to understand this you ll figure it out does anyone know if kingdom and are available on dvd sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring sadly there probably won t be a kingdom ernst hugo jaregard sig died a year after this was filmed but you never know 
the film exposes the blatant exploitation of the chinese worker generally female garnering footage from the chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint his american counterpart also as unashamed and delusional the oppressed workers who are given a voice and of course the drunken americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in new orleans the glimmer of hope comes when some americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like per hour to do so you also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and or they just get too exhausted to work up to hours a day of hard labor i have wondered where those necklaces came from not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them i just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact american indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world honorable mention goes to wal mart it is simply amazing and clearly just the tip of the iceberg 
in this documentary we meet roger the rich manager of a factory in china that makes beads and other trinkets sold and traded at mardi gras in new orleans roger claims the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides but interviews with four of them tell quite another story the girls bleak lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre excesses of mardi gras itself filmmaker david redmon should be lauded for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a chinese factory compound and for landing a revealing on camera interview with the head of the u s company that imports and sells the beads the movie is compellingly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind those ubiquitous made in china labels 
mardi gras made in china provides a wonderful intricate connection between popular culture nudity and globalization through the making and tossing of beads i saw this film at the international film festival of boston and was expecting a dry introduction to globalization but what i got was a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both china and the united states the eye opening film is humorous in depth serious non patronizing and it leaves you wanting more as the credits role it is worth comparing to murderball it s simply that well done the young women workers in china have various points of view and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline the revelers during carnival are the highlight but only because this excellent film provides in depth context inside the factory in china without narration bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film i would have never thought about the connection between beads china and new orleans now i think about the human connection between almost every object but also the role of globalization inequality and fun more importantly i can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film unlike other films on globalization that i ve seen

i was watching this movie on friday apr th i didn t see the last scene cos i was talking with my bro n mom in law at the same time anyone can tell me what happened to her i watched slightly that her husband was hearing someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom and then he opened the door she s dead already what happened to her did she kill herself how could she arrange everything like the phone calls meanwhile she s at home when her husband was talking to this strange admirer anyone can explain to me please i am so so curious in the end i read that she suffered from multiply disorder personality thnks before 
i liked this movie although halfway through it i was able to tell who the secret admirer was i am also wondering if it was based on a true story since it told about the real people at the end of the movie i guess i will have to research it and let ya know does anyone remember what state this happened in i believe they moved to north carolina if i m not mistaken of course the states could have been changed to protect the innocent you would think that this man could have figured it out as easily as i did was he stupid or what 
the stories in this video are very entertaining and it definately is worth a look the first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks with a great but unexplained twist at the end the seond is the best of the lot and it alone makes this worth watching a man is attacked by a dog which he fears to be rabid he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be great twist at the end and this episode alone scores if the others were up to par with this one this would get the third is the weakest of the bunch a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex there appears to be no point to the story until the end with a good little twist but it is spoiled by the awful first part never the less this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all well worth a rental 
i am right now in front of the tv watching casomai it is changing it id evolving or better devolving it begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love story is reported after that everything change a child was born and all the rest usually happen in a couple it is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple and normality is the center of this movie it doesn t want to show us something particular there is nothing new it is just a normal love story the story of a couple and being normal it become different from the rest it is also a flashing movie everything is short every scene is long just some seconds it is a reported story many things are known because friends and parents talk about that and their opinion is central the opinions create the story and destroy it it is a simple story of a couple as i said but it is not boring it just show a couple should be everything known it is but i am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen so don t forget to watch the end 
i now that these days some people wan t see a movie without movie styling so much dogma lars von watchosky brothers are changed what we expect in a movie perhaps casomai is no one more independent non american movie the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage but much more fully of views lectures and let you thinking and i m sure you can t fell boried any second of a long minutes i calculate that don t have a single scene longer that o minutes 
a sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage the main thrust of the narrative arises from a homily spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from milan in it the future course of the marriage is spelled out which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life the moral of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out both now and in the past it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends this film was a relative blockbuster by domestic italian standards it s a terrible shame that this film is not available in either dvd or vhs 
 casomai was the last movie i ve seen before getting married just last year it was also the first movie i ve searched for after i was married because we promised to offer a copy to our priest sometimes reality is not that apart from fiction to all those who wrote that priests like don camillo don t exist in real life i would recommend them to visit my priest pe nuno westwood in estoril portugal to all others i would only recommend them to see this movie before and after the i do day rodrigo ribeiro portugal
this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts i love the final when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life but it s completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right is jut for two so what are the other persons doing there the movie embrace you to a new life to experiences to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams also shows you the life itself hard like it is but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need hope this comment works for you the movie it did worked well for me i bought the movie by the way take care 
 casomai is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage the story is very believable in telling the strange see saw between oblivion and continuous interference by others which is fairly typical in italy one may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere though pavignano and d alatri were very good at writing and that is one of the strong points of the movie acting by stefania rocca and fabio volo is sober and gripping and the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well rounded all in all a truly deserving movie probably one of the best italian movies of the year 
this is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple the movie portrais a couple in italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion infidelity juggling work and family the so called culture of death that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think a must see i hope it gets distributed as it should congratulations on the cast and director two thumbs up and a star evaluation from me 
overall the film is ok i think it s better than sepet and much better than gubra in term of its story its sentimental value there are a few scenes that makes me touched yes i agree that the boy mukhsin did his acting very good brilliant i can say that his acting is almost natural however the song ne me quitte pas by nina simone really menaikkan my bulu roma i love the song both the song ne me quitte pas and hujan i just downloaded the song beautiful and salute to yasmin the movie s ending credit makes me touched again we can see how yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way i think the movie deserves that grand prix of international jury at berlin film festival i give out of o stars 
like his earlier film in a glass cage agust villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see the heightened drama intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical yet never steps into it in that way it pulls off an almost impossible feat to be so over the top and yet so painfully restrained to be so charged and yet so understated and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye unabashed gorgeous and highly tense this film is simply superb 
i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written its not just about entertainment there s tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across and yes it might be confusing to some of you especially if you didn t watch sepet and or gubra for times i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right its really ironic how the characters relate like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future and i absolutely love the voice overs its crude yet awakeningly fresh like when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard then there was suddenly mukhsin s voice saying bismillahhirrahmannirrahim the scene when he climbed the tree it captured malaysian s attitude and in some mild way sniggering at how pathetic it is portrayed in the character for example even the kids can be really sharp tongued complete with the shrill annoying voice and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl when ur own life isn t sorted out all i can say is this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it it kept me glued to the screen i couldn t even take my eyes off it not even to make out in the cinema ha ha 
this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film along the lines of tales from the crypt written by robert bloch author of psycho it s good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast the movie should also be required viewing for doctor who fans since jon pertwee the third doctor has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star 
this is a very amusing and sometimes quite creepy anthology that if a bit short in the screenwriting department more than makes up for the shortcoming in the acting location work and overall exuberance the best episodes of this are the first with denholm elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian the third with christopher lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final episode with the late great jon pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project the dialogue between pertwee and ingrid pitt is sparkling and inspired both obviously relishing the opportunity to really ham it up cushing is typically good in the weakest segment which certainly isn t helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he s obsessed with down at the local wax museum is anything but beautiful as we are told to believe she is someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we re given a woman with a jaw of a turtle minor quibbles aside this movie and it s wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can 
for fans of s hammer type horror films this movie should be a treat the only thing i didn t like about the film was the fact that peter cushing was wasted on the worst episode in general however this is a solid spooky little movie if this is not amicus best film it s certainly one of them the best episode rightfully saved for last is the one featuring jon pertwee as a horror film actor it is really excellent as good as pertwee was in this role it s hard to believe he didn t do more of these types of movies all in all this is an entertaining movie which scared the heck out of me as a child and which still gives me the creeps to this day 
an excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything it s a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates all tied together by a wrap around story about a scotland yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star it starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film star and what he does to the inspector it s a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget add to that the acting talents of peter cushing christopher lee denholm elliott joss ackland ingrid pitt and jon pertwee and you ve got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again just don t answer the phone if anyone from stoker real estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the english countryside 
the late great robert bloch author of psycho for those of you who weren t paying attention scripted this tale of terror and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies i ever saw as a kid i had to walk miles just to see a movie and it was usually dark when i emerged from the theater seeing a horror movie was always unnerving but particularly so when it was as well executed as this one when i had the opportunity to see this one several years ago on videotape which should always be a last resort i was surprised at how well it held up take the terror test watch it at night alone and then tell me it s not scary 
 the house that dripped blood is one of the better anthology films of the time period spoilers tracking down a missing film star inspector holloway john bennett finds that the last reported sighting was in a large mansion in the countryside during the course of looking through the house he is told four different stories about past residents of the house the good story s method for murder moving into the mysterious manor to get some peace and quiet while charles pens his latest masterwork horror novelist charles hillyer denholm elliott and his wife alice joanna dunham are thrilled with the story which centers around a serial strangler named dominic after a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house charles begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife probably one of the better entries in the film it s easily the creepiest the atmosphere here is what sets it apart the scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there s always a classic creep out moment the classic moment is the kill in the psychiatrist s office which is an all time high for creepiness the build up to it with the creaking sounds quick flashes of a mysterious being and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one s favor sweets for the sweet moving into a new house widower john reid christopher lee hires former school teacher ann norton nyree dawn porter for his young daughter jane chloe franks while he s away on business ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from jane s past which john vehemently denies when she learns the true nature of what has happened it s far more shocking that what she could ve thought possible with the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories this is a quite pleasant entry the mystery of the family is wonderfully played out with small amounts of clues piled up here and there and the final revelation is downright nerve wracking that part alone is the main reason why this one works and lee doesn t harm it either the bad story s waxwork tortured by memories of his lost love phillip grayson peter cushing and his friend neville rogers joss ackland both become infatuated with a statue of a woman in a wax museum as the statue takes over their lives they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts the both of them there s a clever premise here and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum which are always creepy this is no exception and it looks eerie which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures a dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace it takes a long time for events to unfold out and most of the time is spent on exposition it also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away those really lower this one a bit had the twist been changed it would ve scored higher the rest is acceptable the cloak veteran horror film actor paul henderson jon pertwee upset at the lack of realism on the set of his new film goes off and buys a new vampire cloak from a specialty store the cloak soon turns him into a vampire going crazy on the set with co star carla ingrid pitt and other vampiric acts at home unconvinced the cloak is the cause he does everything he can to prove it s just in his imagination this has a pretty decent premise and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares but what sinks it is several factors first it s just too goofy for it s own good the plot twist at the end is a perfect example which is so overdone that it s not really a shock at all and just comes across as just plain silly there s so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it s just a bore to sit through it s the weakest one in the film the final verdict a quite decent omnibus film there s a few small problems scattered through each of the stories that renders this a less than perfect but still highly watchable film highly recommended for those into the similar films at the time or who enjoy british horror films today s rating pg violence
this movie is good for what it is and unpretentious i wouldn t watch it twice however i am a peter cushing completist and that s why i watched it the best asset of this movie is brevity and effectiveness compared to other similar movies it does not drag its feet forever as each of the four plus one segments lasts under minutes with the last under good uncanny vibes in the first segment horror writer suffering from writer s block relocates to secluded old house seeking inspiration he finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen plot contrivance similar to premature burial good use of the point of view twist is the writer getting mentally ill or as the ending shows his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husband s phobias to drive him mad secure his estates yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan in the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth which had once separated them from the gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murderer or was she the third segment was the less interesting to me the fourth shows a horror movies actor who thinks he s the best of all sunken to the depths of low budget c movies seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire he gets the real deal this segment also lacks the solidity of the first two acting is fair with the initial segments contributing the bulk of it good movie taken with a grain of salt not the best cushing nor lee but worth watching 
yes this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun that s because although the film clearly was horror some of the stories had a light spirit and there were even occasionally a few laughs this isn t at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good it s one of the better movies of this style i have seen the unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants the first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writer s block so for a change of scenery they rent this house almost immediately elliott s block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer amazingly soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character again and again the psychotic killer appears and then disappears making it seem as if he is losing his mind this might just be the best of the stories as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive the second while not bad at all is probably the weakest peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this later a friend joss ackland visits and he too sees the figure and is entranced by it this all leads to an ending that frankly was a bit of a letdown christopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl during most of this segment lee seemed like an idiot but in the end you can understand his demeanor though slow this one ended very well the fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre jon pertwee the third doctor from the dr who television series is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula however nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film it s actually pretty interesting that he played this role as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times give or take a few i enjoyed pertwee s line when he basically said that lee s and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosi s perhaps this is why lee didn t take this part despite some very silly moments it was very entertaining and fun possibly as good or better than the first segment considering that the film started and ended so well had excellent acting and writing it s hard not to like this film 
amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the s and this from leading horror scribe robert bloch is one of their best efforts there are four stories all worthwhile but two sweets for the sweet and method for murder distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear in sweets christopher lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter chloe franks becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since martin stephens in the innocents this installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage occurring off screen is a moment of purest horror method of murder is about a horror novelist denholm elliott who is menaced by one of his own creations the creepy dominic this episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror dominic may or may not be real so director peter duffell has a great time playing with our expectations the brief shots of dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting the original poster art featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding peter cushing s severed head was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear 
given how corny these movies are you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them the movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there the inhabitants were author charles hillyer denholm elliott with hair who gets haunted by one of his own creations philip grayson peter cushing who gets a little too close to a wax statue john reid christopher lee whose daughter s cuteness is apparently a facade and actor paul henderson jon pertwee on the verge of getting a little too much into character the house that dripped blood is actually worth seeing well duh it stars peter cushing and christopher lee aside from just being neat there might be some undertones it might be calling into question the issue of real horror vs assumed horror like in the shining we might ask whether the house hotel itself holds some memory of past events and if absolutely nothing else ingrid pitt as paul s co star is hot hot hot around the time that this came out she also starred in countess dracula and the vampire lovers also with peter cushing maybe she like barbara steele will remain known only as a scream queen but mark my words she is a hot scream queen i d like to see ingrid pitt and barbara steele co star in something i guess that the only weird scene so to speak is where denholm elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket you read that right what kind of a name is denholm anyway oh well a very cool movie 
film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust hate murder rape theft and deception it weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits the story is sweeping it takes the audience from the atrocities of the spanish civil war to the human wreckage left behind roger casamajor and bruno bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity sets lighting scenery and cinematography are wonderful i absolutely love the photography 
four stories written by robert bloch about various people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them the first has denholm elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he s writing about come to life some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good the second has peter cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife the third has christopher lee who has a child chloe franks and is scared of her it all leads up to a pretty scary ending although the ending in the story was much worse the last is an out and out comedy with jon petwee and ingrid pitt both chewing the scenery and a cape that turns people into vampires there s also a cute line about christopher lee playing dracula this is a good horror anthology nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills also the fourth one is actually very funny and pitt makes a very sexy vampire also the house itself looks beautiful and very creepy it s well directed with some nice atmospheric touches a very good and unusual movie score too all in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out try to see it on dvd the lions gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound 
gbs wrote his own screen adaptation of this nobel prize winning play but didn t live to see it produced he had won an oscar in for his brilliant adaptation of his play pygmalion when otto preminger mounted produced and directed this production in seven years after shaw s death he had noted british author graham greene do the adaptation and it was a solid choice taking a cue from shaw s own screenplay greene uses material from the stage epilogue to create a framing device to meld the two acts of the play one early and one late in joan s story into a unified and most satisfying whole where on stage the shift in tone is buffered with an intermission here it works just as well with a return to king charles balois s bedchamber where the man joan put on the throne is dreaming of the events which led to his current situation and more material from shaw s epilogue the introduction of the shade of john gielgud s warwick the english king maker the majority of the language is solid gbs and the performances from stalwart shauvians like felix aymler s inquisitor or harry andrews de stogumber to relative newcomers the film established jean seberg s career are first rate it may jar some only familiar with richard widmark s many movie villains to see him playing a frail and somewhat silly dauphin but the performance oddly top billed is professional even if arguably miscast the symbolism of the opening credits and the director s choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white filming all serve shaw and the story well go in expecting quality entertainment and you won t be disappointed 
i saw el mar yesterday and thought it to be a great movie it starts with a childhood episode in the life of the main characters ramallo manuel tur and francisca after that we jump about years to an hospital where the friends meet again religion sickness love violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tension filled movie i see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story it s a violent intense and sad story people are expected to suffer to cry to get hurt to bleed and i think that what the film shows isn t done for pure shock value or presented in a distasteful way i know that some people like their films clean even those with violence in it but sometimes a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work this is one of those movies and a great movie it is the only fault i found was that there were or moments were some plot details weren t clear and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie it all made sense but it wasn t anything of much importance to the overall story so i still give this movie a 
this like murder she wrote is one of those shows that after a stressful day at school i sit down in front of the tv and watch why because i genuinely enjoy it and it s a shame it s not on the air anymore dick van dyke is amazing as dr mark sloan a doctor turned detective who with his son solves murders he is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast namely his real life son barry van dyke victoria rowell is also good but i noticed that every series her hairstyle changes i also liked scott baio and charlie schlatter but i particularly loved michael tucci as norman and was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared this show is so entertaining with great guest stars it s a bit obvious at times like colombo but in every episode there is always something to chuckle about in conclusion a great series with two thumbs up and a bethany cox
what network was diagnosis murder on i thought it was cbs am i right or also back in those days the actual production h q was near about the van nuys airport i surely remember because i practically made nearly two episodes in those daze more i remember the early days i had found an article in reader s digest giving this actor writer a clue to a terrific episode so just for suggesting it i was awarded awarded or not i sadly didn t develop it and was cut out of it all due to poor publicity of mine so as a justification i learned as i always have the hard way roll the dice craps just a side bar on mr van dyke he had a house in the brentwood area on chalon road and it was an incredible party house dick had a terrific sense of modernism when he built that house 
the movie takes place in a little swedish town where everybody knows each other here mia visits her parent for the birthday of her father a which occasionally always have some kind of tragedy the question is just what will it be this year and you will be surprised it is an extremely well composed movie with a story which has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness which is rarely seen you get happy you get hurt and basically everything in between finally you can t help falling in love with mia if you are a boy i guess the main actress she is an extremely well chosen actress as a lot of the other actors actresses enjoy
i saw this at the mill valley film festival hard to believe this is ms blom s directorial debut it is beautifully paced and performed large cast of characters could be out of an anne tyler novel i e they are layered with back story and potential futures there are no false notes surprising bursts of humor amidst self inflicted anxiety and very real if not earth shattering dilemmas if you saw the best of youth you will recognize how well drawn the characters are through small moments even as the story moves briskly along i really hope this gets distribution in the usa i live in a fairly sophisticated film market yet we rarely get swedish films of any kind 
this is an incredible film i can t remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered it s funny it s tragic it s compelling and most of all it s a slice of swedish small town life it crushes the clich s and dwells deeper it makes you feel connected not only to the main characters but to all the characters big city girl tracing back to her roots her small hometown to celebrate her father s th birthday crossing paths with people she hasn t met in several years although the story itself isn t unique it offers a fresh approach the center of the story is the relationship between three sisters on different stages in life who aren t very close or at least don t realize how close they are one key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast first i m more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so called a list swedish actors in this film usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in sweden this time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession sofia helin is probably the first swedish actress since eva r se to prove that you don t need words to convey an emotion the writing is also very appealing the dialogue is more than believable and compared with other swedish films from the past year or two it s ahead by miles maria blom controls everything from the beginning and if you didn t know you would never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature length film i can t wait for her next one once you start watching this you really want to see it through 
well done giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser ordered struck the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for effete us minds who d probably prefer some silly speeches and senseless abstractions like points or the league of nations real americans might appreciate the story line and the action for all the action and intrigue fraulein doktor compares favo u rably to jacob s ladder 
i remember seeing this film years ago on i think bbc i would very much like to view it again does anyone know how i can obtain a copy as i remember it was an especially powerful movie in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks apart from that i really can t recall too much about the story which is why i want to view it again i have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy which is unusual in my experience perhaps there is no dvd or vhs of this film on the market would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this thanks very much in advance for your assistance best regards albany googlemail com
there are movies and there are films movies are more often than not merely cinematic candy whereas films are true works of art fraulein doktor is certainly well placed in the latter as most viewers i was highly impressed with the battle scenes but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what i consider to be the most sterling quality of the film having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of deutschland all the while in the throes of morphine addiction die fraulein is treated very shabbily by the german high command despite all of her efforts the scene in which the doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a mercedes benz command auto alone desolate and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a spy s lot in life only the emotional pain presented by richard burton in the spy who came in from the cold comes close fraulein doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing i only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on dvd so that those who have never experienced it can and those who have seen it can again perhaps again and again enjoy this exceptional motion picture 
it seems more than passing strange that such utter dreck as dukes of hazzard and the hills have eyes the new version can find dvd distributors while older and far superior works such as this film are nowhere to be found with all the on going debate about the morality or lack thereof of warfare and interest in espionage consider the multiple jack ryan bourne xxx and mission impossible productions this would seem to be an obvious choice for release on dvd true it looks like a motion picture because it is a motion picture but style consideration aside this is still a production that actually has something valuable to say and has plenty of plots twists to keep an audience entertained if nothing else will somebody please consider getting the soundtrack onto some kind of cd whether it be a compilation with other morricone music or as a stand alone i don t know if industry people bother to read what we fans have to say about their products but if you are reading this and other comments please take us seriously we are paying for your lavish homes with our hard earned dollars spent on tickets dvds and cds give us what we want all that said if you are reading this and have not seen this film lobby for it s release so you may see what those of us who have seen it are talking about you will not be disappointed 
i havent seen that movie in or more years but i remember the attack scene with the horses wearing gas masks vividly this scene ranks way up there with the best of them including the beach scene on saving private ryan i recommend it strongly 
like other people who commented on fr ulein doktor i stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late night tv without having heard of it before the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well researched portrayal of war in the trenches on the other hand had me hooked from the beginning to me this is one of the five best movies about wwi the others are all quiet on the western front paths of glory gallipoli and the post war la vie et rien d autre and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks i only wish i had taped the film 
smallville episode justice is the best episode of smallville it s my favorite episode of smallville 
this particular episode of smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion this is for many reasons for example it takes the series back to some of it s roots it welcomes back lionel from a supposedly long absence with the luthorcorp plaza office in metropolis this room hasn t been in smallville for a very long time and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallville s past not to mention lionels conversations with lex are always admirable another pleasant return is well uv guessed it is bart allen aka impulse ac aka aquaman and victor stone aka cyborg not only does steven deknight reunite the former justice leaguers he blends them in with the smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost feels like it is a feature length movie from there you get the basic story green arrow forms the league attempts to blow up bart gets captured clark saves him and the facility is blown to kingdom com all is good and graceful with a good mix of stealth action pace and suspense oh and cyborg has some cool new upgrades true to the justice league character the music is probably what makes this episode work so well if you remember correctly the first episode steven deknight directed was agless from season this was a mediocre episode but something felt out of place maybe it was the music or the acting or the fact clark sais at the end we didn t find you you found us kind of made people lose faith in the formula but thankfully steve deknight redeemed himself in this justice episode i had a few quivvles about justice that made it fall short of the full first of all the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the ridge facility expolsion i mean it would have been soo much cooler if say green arrow and cyborg took off on oliver s bike rememeber from the arrow episode clark and impulse should have obviously ran and aquaman should have swam via another route but that was soo incredibly cheesy it nocked off points from the full secondly another cheesy moment not as bad as the first but when green arrow sais let s go save the world that made me cringe all in all judging by the acting performances music direction and production values the pros do outweigh the cons and this is still one of the best episodes in smallville history and maybe the nd best episode in season out of 
i really enjoyed this episode seeing the flash cyborg green arrow and aquaman even though all he did was swim made my eyes widen to see most of the founders of the justice league trying to bring down lex luthor is what i ve been waiting for this sounds a bit off topic but making a live action justice league show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode this is the thrill i got from watching this episode i wish they had made this episode a little longer like a two hour special because i felt that one hour of the justice league wasn t enough now before i bore you unless i already have with my rambling i just want to say smallville is cool again it sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on lana but i m sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole so enjoy this episode who knows when another good one s going to come out catch it again this thursday feb if you missed the first airing 
show favorites green arrow introduced this season aquaman introduced in season impulse season and cyborg season all come together along with clark to stop one of lex s evil plans in this thrilling mid season episode through his sophisticated technology green arrow learns that lex luthor is constructing laboratories across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance kryptonite and people with abilities to run tests on green arrow over the past months has allied arthur curry aqua bart allen impulse and victor stone cyborg to stop lex and destroy these facilities after recruiting clark to help the team puts on quite a show in interrogating and destroying a local laboratory this episode is incredible full of action humor and fabulous dialog it feels more like a movie it is full of entertainment and provides as a springboard for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season 
i loved this episode it is so great that all of them team up and stop luthercorp and save the world i also love this episode because kyle gallner bart allen impulse and justin hartley oliver queen green arrow are guest starring in it i just hope that clark will join the justice league and we ll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe it was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next i think chloe should also join the team as watchtower that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the daily planet because she doesn t have super powers also i want to find out what types of subjects lex is going to use for i wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have 
leslie charteris series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady simon templar the saint was brought to the screen in the late s with the up and coming george sanders as templar it was a careful choice sanders usually would play villains with occasional nice roles ffoliott in foreign correspondence the title hero in the strange case of uncle harry the framed best friend of robert montgomery in rage in heaven here his willingness to bend the rules and break a law briefly fit his heavy persona while his good looks and suave behavior made templar a fit shady hero like chester morris boston blackie and to an extent peter lorre s mr moto the films are not the best series of movie mystery serials but they are serviceable like rathbone s holmes series or oland s chan s series the show frequently had actors repeating roles or playing new ones the anti heroine in the film here was played by wendy barrie who would show up in a second film in the series this and slightly familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers who hear the buzz of the dialog always showing sanders braininess in keeping one step ahead of the bad guys without noting the obvious defects of the plot all these mysteries have defects due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can t avoid repeating old ideas again and again and again here the moment when that happened was when one of the cast admitted his affection for barrie which she was long aware of shortly after he tries to protect her from the police but as the film dealt with the identity of a criminal mastermind it became obvious that this person was made so slightly noble as to merit being the mysterious mastermind i e the script disguised him as the least likely suspect barrie is after the proof that her father who died in prison was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang she has several people assisting her mugs like william gargan and she gets advice from the mastermind on planning embarrassing burglaries that can t be pinned on her the d a who got her father convicted jerome cowan is determined to get barrie and her gang the only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is jonathan hale who is shadowing sanders but reluctantly working with him the cast has some nice moments in the script hale currently on a special diet is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner made for sanders by willie best he gets a serious upset stomach as a result enabling sanders and barrie to flee sanders apartment best has to remind him when he feels better to head for a location that sanders told him to go to at a certain time there is also an interesting role for gilbert emery usually playing decent people like the brow beaten husband in between two worlds he plays a socially prominent weakling here whose demise is reminiscent of that of a character in a bogart movie on the whole a well made film for the second half of a movie house billing in it will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory 
it s not too bad a b movie with sanders barrie hale cowen hamilton gargan fitzgerald and even willie best we could be either with charlie chan moto the falcon blackie holmes or the saint etc in other words you get the chance to spend another hour in the company of some old friends from plain to urbane murdering and being murdered always a pleasure in my book barrie s a hard boiled dame out to avenge and clear her framed and dead father a police detective by planning and carrying out with her coterie a string of underworld assassinations which would surely have had the opposite effect sanders joins in the fun simply by dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting falling on both him and the first killer at the right time and killing him the story and acting s ok the only gripe i ve got is near the end with the hurried and almost laughable discovery of who the evil genius waldeman was did they almost forget about his relevance in the plot that said a solid entry in the series 
catscratch is the best thing to come out of nickeloden including wayne knight this show doesn t just appeal to maoris and pi s some people love it and they re all aussies at first glimpse i admit it seems a little crude but it grows enormously on you also to correct something that one of the other critics has said in_correct tv com doesn t say does that mean you re homo now he says does that mean you re homo owww this is his phrase in the show mr blik is i think the funniest of all like peww weww s playhouse firstly i ll admit that the early episode were a bit good but after a while the episodes became great and just when the series had found it s surreal whacky nickelodeon cancels it i know nick is meant for kids but every once in a while a brilliant show appears that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults these shows include mr bean the animated series charlie brown pelswick rocko s modern life at times and invader zim all of these must have been considered too good with the exception of catdog cause nick felt the need to cancel them what i like the famous final episode where gordon fight a duck i d also like to see a dvd with plenty of audio commentaries and behind the scenes docos and including the final episode but of course what i d definitely like to see is the show come back on the air wake up nick i wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all the gag closing credits that would be great 
i love this show mr blick gordon and waffle are cats so different from each other yet they refer to themselves collectively as brothers i often find myself trying to imitate the tired sighing accent of their butler hovis or even the scottish borough of gordon there should be more episodes made about human kimberly the episode about the cats disguising themselves as pre teen girls to gain admittance to human kimberly s slumber party in order to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink rootbeer is a hilarious classic we can t drink rootbeer in our house now without either doing the catscratch voices or the hanson brothers from the movie slap shot future classic where can i get the first two seasons on dvd 
ok here is my personal list of top nicktoons shows as in today all grown up spongebob squarepants my life as a teenage robot invader zim catscratch rugrats notice a word with only capital letters that means this is the nick show i m going to talk about catscratch is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three wealthy cats mr blik gordon and waffles who get into weird and really surreal situations from attempting to join human kimberely s slumber party for root beer to saving a planet of slugs from the evil spaceship this is one nick show that you will simply have your funny bone tickled sooner or later the theme song is catchy and memorable voice actors including wayne knight from the seinfield franchise brings the characters to fresh life with very quirky personalities the stories are enjoyable fans episodes would be king of all root beer and gordon s lucky claw and the humor is all done in some style of earthworm jim so in conclusion catscratch is one of the nicktoons series like invader zim and mlaatr which becomes very very popular all over the world in just seasons or less 
not since spongebob squarepants have i seen a greater cartoon on tv the colors are great the voices could t be better the characters are so original great great cartoon hope nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon hope the season dvd comes out soon i love cartoons like this and i hope more people tune in to se this great cartoon it is very hard to find the season dvd so if somebody finds a store that is selling it please let me know the only catscratch merchandise available on nick shop is a great lookin shirt but very very very expensive if you love spongebob and who doesn t you ll love catscratch too 
this was a wonderful film how these women tried to save their husbands i thought that the performances of the actors were great i had to think about the film for a very long time i think that every student should see this film so that they can think about war relationships friendship and love i liked the film because it told and showed me how strong love can be i wish i could be so strong as a woman i really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that is what i like to see in a movie i think you can compare the film with der untergang the pianist if you put these three films together you have a great sight of what happened during the war we should remember something like the war forever 
rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in adversity reichdeutch women find that their jewish husbands have been locked up pending deportation one an aristocrat disowned by her family lena fischer finds herself among the mob as does general gudarian s sister but rank and privilege merit no special consideration nor does service to the reich as a female detainee whose husband is on the ostfront will learn in one of the most horrifying scenes of the movie the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier husband lest you think this is typical german brutishness we in america today have lady bush imperiously ordering the arrest of gold star mothers mothers of us service members killed in action because their very presence is offencive little regrettably has changed in the years from der fuher to der fumbler fortunately the eight year old daughter ruth escapes capture waiting in the cold on rosenstrasse lena fischer is at first reluctant to take in ruth responding in a way that we take as typically german even lena fisher s brother colonel arthur von eschenbach who is aware of and opposed to the holocost cautions lena against it but lena chooses to embrace the idea with an american rebelliousness even renaming ruth the more aryan sounding name helga lehmann the siege ends favourably on rosenstrasse but lena mourns what happened to ruth after the war years later ruth s daughter hannah sets out in search of her mother s past and meets year old lena under the guise of writing a personal history of the war i did deem it interesting that hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the ostfront 
i saw this film at the toronto film festival where it received a standing ovation this film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before namely about the rosenstrasse a street in berlin uprising of german gentile women who were married to jews at the end of the second world war as such it is a unique story and what s more is the only film about the holocaust that i have ever seen that shows that there were good germans the helping family in anne frank for instance was dutch who did not support the nazis and in fact had the fortitude to stand up against their own country s immorality and brutality during the nazi regime at the risk of their very lives the acting is great across the board the framing story in new york interesting and intricate the direction from von trotta masterful in every scene and the production values including the gorgeous cinematography outstanding of course the family in new york could be speaking german many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family a common occurrence so that criticism is unwarranted to say more would spoil the experience the film is long but i did not look at my watch once i am hoping this film gets some distribution is north america for not only is this film a masterpiece but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the germans because of their support of hitler if this film is playing in your area i urge you to see it you will be glad you did 
 gespenster forms together with yella and jerichow the gespenster trilogy of director christian petzold doubtless one of the creme de la creme german movie directors of our time roughly gespenster tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a years old child while the mother turned around her head for minute in berlin and has never been seen ever since then the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of time dilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age as we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie however this time when she meets nina everything comes quite different the movie does not bring solutions not even part solutions and insofar it is rather disappointing we are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not most disappointing is the end after what we have witnessed in the movie it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy f ex in umberto d but in gespenster it is displaced since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows this is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of aristotelian logic according to which the notion of the individual holds the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else so the aristotelian answer to my question is they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change everybody who is not insane believes that however what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change e g scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart shaped birthmark under their right shoulder blade this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that despite our modern aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind 
this isn t another searing look at the holocaust but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in berlin and some of the people that were involved this film starts in the present time in new york city where ruth weinstein jutta lampe is in mourning over the death of her husband and family members have all gathered to her side ruth s daughter hannah maria schrader slowly learns that her mother was raised by an aryan woman named lena fischer doris schade and so she travels to germany and locates the year old who tells her about the events on rosenstrasse spoiler alert lena talks about berlin in where the gestapo would hold all the jewish spouses in a building on rosenstrasse street even though they are supposed to have immunity for being married to aryans and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and shout for their release eight year old ruth svea lohde awaits for her mother to come out and has nowhere to go but she meets year old lena katja riemann who takes her in lena s husband fabian martin feifel is also inside and eventually she tries to socialize with nazi officers to get them to do something this film is directed by margarethe von trotta who is making her first feature film in almost years after working in television and while this is clearly not one of her more provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered directors in europe this is not one of those nazi films where we view horrible acts of inhumanity to jews although we do see some severe treatment being issued out but instead this is more of a retelling of a small event that meant life and death to the people involved this film isn t trying to shock anyone or open the door to debates on the circumstances but what it simply wants to do is just shed a light on a small but true life event that occurred during an historical period part of the films strength comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine through especially by riemann and young lohde and it s always good to see schrader aimee jaguar in a pivotal role this isn t a great film or something that s going to change your perspective on wwii but considering that innocent lives were put to death because of the events that took place i think that reason alone is important enough to retell this true story 
another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the rosenstrasse protest in berlin an event i had not known of that began in late february the details are given in an addendum that follows this review the film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in new york city in the present here a well off non observant jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual she goes even further demanding that her daughter s non jewish fianc leave the house the distressed daughter hannah maria schrader then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during wwii in berlin her mother then years old had been taken in and protected by an aryan woman hannah drops everything goes to berlin and finds this woman lena fischer now hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story it all seems rather too pat the film thereafter improves focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of that surrounded the protest in which the fictitious central character is the same mrs fischer at played magnificently by katja riemann a baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to fabian martin feifel a jewish concert violinist one of the men detained at the rosenstrasse site the narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in new york city once again while scenes in the present are color saturated the scenes are washed out strong on blue gray tones the quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in germany and the direction of margarethe von trotta new german cinema s most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress the story of the protest is told simply only one feature is lacking that would have helped still text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positive rosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music so go the usual raps it is too long but i found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on rosenstrasse where their jewish relatives and others were detained i found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction the very absence of extreme violence no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed you keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute the somberness of the film stayed with me afterward i awoke often later in the night i saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film for me that happens rarely in german and english my rating b seen on if you d like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites add the rosenstrasse protest swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the final roundup in the national capital to jews mostly men married to non jewish women were herded into rosenstrasse a welfare office for the jewish community in central berlin because these jews had german relatives many of them highly connected adolf eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied poland normally those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the east but before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the rosenstrasse address first in ones and twos and then in ever growing numbers perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest although not all at the same time women demanded back their husbands day after day for a week unarmed unorganized and leaderless they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the third reich joseph goebbels the gauleiter governor or district leader of berlin anxious to have that city racially cleansed was also in charge of the nation s public morale on both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women s actions rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the final solution goebbels with hitler s concurrence released the rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty five of them who already had been sent to auschwitz to both hitler and goebbels the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable but they were mistaken almost all of those released from rosenstrasse survived the war the women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction adapted from an article posted at the university of south florida website a teacher s guide to the holocaust 
berlin born in margarethe von trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer she has been described perhaps even unfairly caricatured as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman s sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths rosenstrasse which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews the new york times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews i ve ever read in that paper is not a perfect film it is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal nazi regime by of all peoples generically powerless germans demonstrating in a berlin street co writer von trotta uses the actual rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman s search for information about her mother s never disclosed life as a child in the german capital during world war ii the husband of ruth weinstein jutta lampe has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance ruth not only sits shivah the jews week long mourning ritual but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith her apartment in new york city reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse s labors her american born daughter hannah maria schrader and her brother are a bit put off by mom s assumption of restrictive orthodox jewish practices but they pitch in the mother coldly rejects the presence of hannah s fiance a non jew named luis fedja van huet a domestic crisis might well erupt as ruth warns that she ll disown hannah if she doesn t give up doting handsome luis stay tuned a cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested hannah about a wartime mystery about mom s childhood in berlin hannah is intrigued she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life this is very very realistic i grew up with parents who fled nazi germany just in time and i knew many children whose families in whole but usually in part escaped the holocaust those days were simply not discussed so hannah having learned that a german gentile woman saved ruth s life traipses off to berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing were she not this would have been a very short film but ruth pretending to be a historian locates year old lena fischer doris schade now a widow as the happy to be interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories lena tells her story the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day berlin and the war time capital the young lena of katja riemann was a fine pianist married to a jewish violinist fabian fischer martin feifel with the advent of the nazi regime he was required to use israel as a middle name just as jewish women had to add sarah to their names incidentally i wish imdb had not given fabian s name on its characters list with the false israel included it simply perpetuates a name applied by nazis as a mark of classification and degradation while germany deported most of its jewish population to concentration camps those married to aryans were exempted for a time until when the regime decided to take them too most were men a minority were jewish women married to non jews the roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity the young lena tries to locate her husband all she and many other women know is that they re confined in a building on rosenstrasse the crowd of anxious women builds up some piteously seeking help from german officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them jew loving whore being one appellation as a subplot lena more or less adopts eight year old ruth who hid when her mother was seized remember ruth is now sitting shiva in manhattan the child ruth is fetchingly portrayed by svea lohde through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail the men and a handful of women are released as in the real story the nazis gave in one of the rare almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that s another story von trotta builds up the tension and each woman s story is both personal and universal hannah continues to prod the aging lena who slowly one gathers begins to suspect she s not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued the child whose mother was murdered the contrasts between rosenstrasse of a set and the street today in a bustling rebuilt unified berlin provide a recurring thematic element today s berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past von trotta makes that point very well the main actors are uniformly impressive lena s husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters including the local police and military as a one way trip to oblivion the older ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy new york life hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father s death triggers a need to discover her family s past these things happen although the times s critic appears not to know that von trotta s hand is sure but not perfect a scene with goebbels at a soiree enjoying lena s violin playing is unnecessary and distractive the suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister the most fanatical top level hitler worshiper to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives most of the german officers come from central casting and are molded by the erich von stroheim copy and paste school of teutonic nastiness but that s understandable the rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it s a paradigm case for arguing that many more jews could have been saved had more germans protested unfortunately that argument is nonsense the german women who occupied rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self interested most germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti semitism that s why the rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular whether one buys or rejects the goldenhagen thesis that most germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre nazi endemic anti semitism erupted into a virulent strain from on the elderly lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was a ray of light in an evil time most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war so a ray of light it was and von trotta s movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists and always will 
 what i like about spoilers teenager holly tyler amanda bynes goes to live with older sister valerie jennie garth to avoid moving to japan with her father but she doesn t know the half of the wacky things that will happen to her from now on and not only to her but to her sister her friends gary wesley jonathan and tina alison munn boyfriend henry michael mcmillian crush vince nick zano valerie s boyfriend jeff simon rex first boss then firefighter then husband vic dan cortese annoying colleague lauren leslie grossman and second boss peter if you don t have a funny bone in your body please skip this if you like only veeeery sophisticated comedy this isn t for you if you like a funny sometimes touching show with two hot chicks who can act in the lead and none other than the fabulous mary cherry from popular leslie grossman in the main cast then what the hell are you waiting for you re welcome to casa de tyler what i like about you 
i ve seen this film more than once now and there s always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot afterwards but then this is part of petzold s game he plays along with the rules of genre it s very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls timoteo hummer meet is again mirrored in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting this film is a journey between fact and fiction it s more about potentials things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future than it is about actual ongoings it s a reverie sorts of so apt enough there are a lot of motives freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis like all the doppelganger constellations also i think gespenster might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny petzold s everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive strangely familiar way this film is not about the obvious to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who searches europe for her lost daughter clearly doesn t say much about the nature of gespenster at all 
the show is about two sisters living together holly being the younger one has some teenage problems on the other hand her sister val has job boy friend fianc problems like most of the women on the planet they try to support each other they make mistakes sometimes but they don t give up and continue and the show is also about friendship the priorities in life i loved this show so much it is funny and the actors are so good i am really sad that the show is over i still watch the reruns time to time amanda bynes is very talented jenny garth may be new to comedy but she plays really well she is one of the actresses i like watching i like vince and holly s relationship they are very natural gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh each time he shows up with tina holly found a real friend and i really like them hanging out lauren character is so funny and she is a natural talent i would like to see her more this show really takes you in and makes you laugh i wish the show hasn t been over 
 moonstruck is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller norman jewison in the heat of the night fiddler on the roof the hurricane the film is great on many levels it shows a good slice of italian culture has a touching romance and best of all is a hilarious comedy one thing i liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors nicolas cage looks positively odd for most of the film and cher well cher always looks a little odd overall it s a fun film and easy to recommend out of 
this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival but unlike yes by sally potter which i had seen some days before where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe it was as if all of a sudden there was nothing left all hope all future had been taken away to a dead place nina s life seemed to be dismal and locked but then one lovely day there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion just out of nothing someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life that person was toni a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots just like herself but the film s title is ghosts and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish there is no way to retain them ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself hiding away from all other people fran oise a french woman is a victim of such ghosts she once lost her child daughter in berlin who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket in just one moment of inattentiveness now time has passed and fran oise is back in berlin still looking for the missing child nina could be that child after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity and nina adopts that idea after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion she also longs for a mother but in the end she is empty handed toni has disappeared with a man and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman marie is dead concludes fran oise s husband and the statement could not be more disillusioning nina is just a ni a a girl without name there is no hope for any divine fulfillment there is no marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives therefore in the end we see nina all alone about to walk along the road that has opened up before her into a future that seems joyless and uncertain 
it is quite a simple not very active but very charming film there were moments where i can see why cher won the academy award for best actress but there were other times when i wondered why glenn close didn t win for fatal attraction anyway oscar and golden globe winning and bafta nominated cher plays loretta castorini a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by mr johnny cammareri danny aiello to marry him he promises her he ll be back in a month as his mother is sick so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible only problem is when she finds johnny s one handless brother ronny golden globe nominated nicolas cage they start having a relationship and there love goes on to that moon scene where the title comes from also starring oscar nominated vincent gardenia as cosmo castorini oscar bafta and golden globe winning olympia dukakis as rose castorini and john mahoney as perry it ends with no wedding for johnny and loretta but she and ronny were happy together it won the oscar for best writing screenplay written directly for the screen and it was nominated for best director for norman jewison in the heat of the night and best picture it was nominated the baftas for best score for dick hyman and best original screenplay and it was nominated the golden globes for best motion picture comedy musical and best screenplay it was number on years quotes snap out of it it was number on years passions and it was number on years laughs very good 
i bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if i bought it earlier it invariably supersedes anything else on those cosmo s moon nights cher and olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay what you don t know what a cosmo s moon is 
 moonstruck is one of the best films ever i own that film on dvd the movie deals with a new york widow cher who falls in love with her boyfriend s danny aiello angry brother nicholas cage who works at a bakery i m glad cher won an oscar for that movie nicholas cage and danny aiello are great too the direction from norman jewison who directed fiddler on the roof is fantastic moonstruck is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh a must see stars 
the movie aimed at adults is a rare thing these days but moonstruck does it well and is still a better than average movie which is aging very well although it s comic moments aim lower than the rest of it the movie has a wonderful specificity italians in brooklyn that isn t used to shortchange the characters or the viewers i e mobsters never appear in acomplication it never becomes grotesque like my big fat greek wedding the secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread these are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs i miss these scenes it also beautifully involves older characters the movie takes it s own slight quiet path to a conclusion there isn t a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax cage and cher do very nice work moonstruck invokes old school ethnic workaday new york much like marty except moonstruck is way less sanctimonious 
as someone else has already said here every scene in this film is gem most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect but director jewison hit a home run every time the cast got just the right take on the excellent script and in addition dick hyman s musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film the comedy is subtle mostly and the camera work mirrors every little emotional inflection of the narrative cher is such a comedy natural vincent gardenia who i know mostly through his frank lorenzo role on all in the family until i saw him in this and then off broadway in the s deserved far greater stardom than he ever got and aiello s hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast has jewison ever written about this film would love to read it hard to figure out why the average rating here at imdb is so low 
i don t think that many films especially comedies have added memorable quotable dialog like moonstruck i won t illustrate it you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me it is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory how about a restaurant waiter who regrets a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client or a nice elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon or perry john mahoney s description of a female student s youthful promise as moonlight in a martini my favorite line moonstruck is a wonderful example of brilliant script first rate direction and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly there are other examples the drama the ox bow incident is another example but a grimmer one cher olympia dukakis vincent gardenia nicholas cage john mahoney and danny aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love and how to handle it is it a good thing to be totally in love cher and cage at the end seem to think so but dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy and cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too when he and cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera la boheme is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death dukakis believes so and oddly enough although he is not totally convinced aiello chance reveals infidelity dukakis realizes early that gardenia s odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness and cher literally stumbles onto gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera but gardenia also stumbles onto cher s similar unfaithfulness to aiello but chance also causes misunderstandings fyodor chaliapin stumbles on dukakis walking with john mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair there are lovely little moments in the film too cher s observation about flowers leading to receiving one her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it s resolution but best is the sequence of louis guss and julie bovasso as cher s uncle and aunt raymond and rita cappomaggi and rita s charming and kind comment to raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him it is the sweetest moment of the entire film it is close to a flawless film after seeing it over a dozen times in as many years i can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be when cher is at cage s bakery his assistant chrissy nada despotovich mentions how she is secretly in love with cage but has been afraid to tell him earlier she was slightly snippy towards cher who put her in her place quickly yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry at the same time the fact that cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt s daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film but just as quickly dropped was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped besides one about cher and vincent gardenia working at a homeless man s shelter as penance it is a small annoyance but i think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good 
this film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies it is virtually flawless the writing acting production design humor and pathos are all wonderful even the music from dean martin to la boheme is captivating and delightful every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable from the leads played by cher and nicolas cage to the many supporting roles olympia dukakis vincent gardenia john mahoney danny aiello even grandpa with his dog pack each of these performers plus norman jewison as director performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work for several of the actors this was an early major exposure in film so the casting is also exceptional and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film i ve seen this film several times all the way through which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially more tellingly i realized some years ago that whenever i channel surfed my way into a scene from this film any scene the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted there are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the cher and nicolas cage characters where cage tells his tale of woe vincent gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera amidst the splendor generated by his gold mine plumbing business olympia dukakis scolding john mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co workers don t sh t where you eat danny aiello at his dying mother s bedside nicolas cage taking cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background there are of course many great romantic comedies among them sabrina both versions but especially the audrey hepburn humphrey bogart william holden original when harry met sally the apartment none quite equals moonstruck 
this movie is still an all time favorite only a pretentious humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film this movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream i think this is cher s best work ever and her most believable performance cher has always been blessed with charisma good looks and an enviably thin figure whether you like her singing or not who else sounds like cher cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone she is one of the most unique artists out there it s funny because who would have thought of cher as such a naturally gifted actress she is heads above the so called movie stars of today cher is a real actor on the same level as debra winger alfre woodard holly hunter angela bassett and a few others in that she never seems to be acting she really becomes the character convincingly she has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie going public everything about moonstruck is wonderful the characters the scenery the dialog the food i never get tired of watching this movie every time single time i watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at rose s house i pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food rose is serving i saw the spaghetti mushrooms i think but i can t make out whether they are eating ravioli ziti what is that main course it looks wonderful and its driving me nuts everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another the grandfather wasn t pushed aside and tolerated he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom he seemed to be a pretty healthy independent old codger too loretta s mom wasn t just a housewife she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife mother and home manager should aspire to be she was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn t let it define who she was high powered businessmen aren t as comfortable in their skin as rose casterini was notice the saucy way she said i didn t have kids until after i was it ain t over til its over you got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened she was charming quick witted and very smart what a great mom i didn t actually like loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know it all who wasn t really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think she could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong but she really didn t apply common sense to her own life she was going to marry a middle aged mama s boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life she was more conventional than her own mom she dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man she would probably end up making an awesome mom too i could see in the future a house full of loretta and ronnie s loud screaming happy kids and rose and cosmo enjoying every minute of it 
there is nothing not to like about moonstruck i m from a new york italian family and i actually get a little homesick when i watch it the actors actresses the plot the subplots the humor they were all fantastic it starts a little slow but a lot happens in that two days i fell in love with laboheme because of this movie on my list of favorite movies moonstruck is number it s a feel good movie where you leave the theatre humming that s amore or repeating some of your favorite lines old man if you give those dogs another piece of my food i ll kick you till you re dead chrissy bring me the big knife who s dead do you love him loretta good because when you do they drive you crazy because they know they can i always put moonstruck on when there s nothing good to watch because it makes me happy 
 moonstruck is a love story there is not one romance there are at least three but they all have to do with the same family loretta s family loretta cher is about to marry johnny cammareri danny aiello she doesn t love him but he is sweet and good man when he leaves to visit his dying mother in italy loretta meets johnny s brother ronny nicolas cage he and johnny haven t spoken each other in five years and loretta wants to invite him to the wedding of course they fall instantly for each other how this story and love stories of loretta s parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself every seen is a delight to watch with cher as the bright star in the middle of everything she won and really deserved the oscar that year cage is pretty good and goofy as well and olympia dukakis as loretta s mother and vincent gardenia as her father are terrific this movie is funny charming and therefore highly enjoyable 
this movie is brilliant in every way it touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way but never lectures the script never condescends toward any character not even the hapless johnny it also and benefits from spot on direction production design casting and performances the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike cher than she has ever been is a wonder to me i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my year old twin daughters and they loved it as well it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end 
loretta castorini cher is a woman in her late thirties a widow who lives with her parents in a duplex apartment in brooklyn she is engaged to marry johnny cammareri danny aiello a bland man more out of a resigned duty than actual love before their wedding johnny takes a trip out to visit his mother who is sick and leaves loretta the function of playing the olive leaf with his brother ronny by notifying him of their impending wedding ronny nicholas cage hasn t forgiven johnny for being the cause of his accident which caused him the loss of his hand and subsequently his then bride to be but he does fall for loretta and hard after a heated affair loretta out of respect for johnny tries to avoid ronny but his dark looks and overpowering masculinity win her over meanwhile loretta s mother rose castorini olympia dukakis is not only suspecting her husband cosmo vincent gardenia is seeing another woman but is also herself the subject of admiration from a college professor and wonders why do men chase women things get complicated when johnny returns from sicily to tell loretta they can t be married the setup is pure sitcom but the story written by john patrick shanley with a deep understanding for italian americans living in new york is genuine he gets the idiosyncrasies of these people and their day to day foibles and quirks and all of the characters have a deep romanticism that comes through in key moments throughout the story loretta a character hardened by the loss of her husband and knowing her chances of happiness are slim slowly emerges as a woman who is so swept by the sudden recognition of love she becomes the heroine of la boheme the one who acknowledges the love of the man with the wooden hand in a clever gender reversal and cher inhabits the role and makes it hers and in her own style subtly trades her frumpiness to a deep dark beauty ronny is pure fire and nicholas cage exudes masculine power as if he were channeling marlon brando the castorini s and the cappomaggi s counterbalancing the central couple both express their love for each other in two very crucial moments the latter couple on the night of the full moon when loretta and ronny consummate their affair a rare scene depicting love and intimacy among the elderly and the former at a tense moment over breakfast when rose bluntly reveals in touching words that she wants cosmo to stop seeing his mistress mona anita gillette moonstruck is not only the romantic comedy and date movie of choice but also a beautiful examination of love and passion among regular people the ending is a tour de force of emotional impact the family situation going beyond the momentary complications to cement it in tradition going back to the days of immigrants and is one that elevates this movie from being just another feel good movie to a classic moonstruck deservedly got its oscars for best writing actress and supporting actress and has proved to grow beyond its time 
this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads chasing the big murder case you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime no nudity but lots of sexual implication slapstick silliness everything adolescents go for low budget but very entertaining definite cult classic potential 
this movie is so cheap it s endearing with ron liebmann major vaughn providing the most entertaining on screen diatribes in film history i own copies of this movie on video on one ralph macchio is caught actually cracking up in the background at major vaugn while he is ranting at hash obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film but it goes to show just how funny the movie is when the actors themselves can t keep a straight face 
for a no budget movie this thing rocks i don t know if america s gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really non hollywood the actors and music rocked the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up whooo whooo i ve seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think i ve seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it rocked luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors 
i may very well be one of the few who really stuck to this film i also saw this movie when it came out and i agree with the last post that up the acedemy was way ahead of its time the humor in the film itself is pure mad magazine i don t see why mad stand behind this feature it was also one of the few films of the early s to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerging from l a at the time i own the soundtrack and i play it constantly to this day what can i say there are definitely worst movies out there i don t consider porky s to be as funny as up the academy there are some really good laughs throughout the film and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid hey nobody said this was going to be the maltese falcon 
this movie has it all sight gags subtle jokes play on words and verses it is about a rag tag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes that come together to defeat a common enemy if you watch this more than once you will find you are quoting it like animal house and yes i love animal house also i put in the top funniest movies the major at a boys military academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to cause trouble in this movie he is right he is sadistic uncaring cruel and has to be taken down the group of boys that do not get along at first end up teaming together to survive and get rid of the major with a wacky plan only mad magazine could of wrote a must see you will love it 
misfits at a military school hmmmm sounds funny maybe offensive to some you have the characters there the arab thief the sex crazy teen the smart mouth the pot smoker and not to forget the guy who burns things throw in a strict no nonsense sergent a homosexual sergent and one sexy ammunition teacher and it makes one crazy film adventure i have seen this film and it is funny because the comedy is revolved around the fact that if you try to work together things get done these band of misfit students at weinberg military school have been placed in here because as sgt liceman quotes because you are outcasts embarrassments to your families and communities disgraces one of ralph macchio s earlier performances before the karate kid and my cousin vinny with appearances from barbara bach as well this film appeals to teens and young adults great soundtrack keeps the film moving 
back in my high school days in salina kansas they filmed something called the brave young men of weinberg locally and the film crews were rather prominent for weeks eventually we learned that the film was up the academy and was a bit ummm lower brow than we had been led to believe i had to see it since i was there and the local audiences seemed less than pleased at the showing i was and thought it was a rather artless attempt at a post animal house type of comedy right down to the fart jokes watched it many times since and my opinion has mellowed a bit it s dumb but at times it catches a bit of the mad magazine humor at least as well as most mad tv ron liebman might hate it but he is nearly perfect and unforgettable for me my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on santa fe avenue where i had parked my car while i was buying some guitar strings too bad my pinto s brief appearance usually seems to get cut for tv haven t seen the new dvd but if my old pinto is visible they ve got a sale 
this is one of the greatest s movies it sticks out like a turd in a punchbowl i can t believe mad magazine denounced it or whatever and yet they proudly put their name on a show with stuart i speak a no enlish chinese lady and ups guy on speed what s up with that and i love ron leibman he s foxy wonder why he had his name removed from the credits it was his funniest role that i know of of course he s not nearly as foxy as he was in norma rae but in my opinion this movie is right up there with national lampoon s vacation if you liked movies such as porky s fast times last american virgin or any of the other s teen focused movies you ll love this one rent it and you ll see what i mean 
i love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years it does get better with every viewing i agree with all of the positive reviews here yes it s gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days i found myself doing commentary as i watched it someone on here said rip torn was miscast i couldn t disagree more he is brilliant as the dour miserly clyde stewart who says little and works like a slave workhorse conchatta farrell is fantastic as the widowed elinor whom clyde hires as a housekeeper cook along with her old daughter lilia skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma also a star is the stark montana prairie it is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle there are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary no special effects here what you see is real it even has a terrificly perfect music score and a great script once you see heartland you ll never forget it it deserves all the s it gets here 
first time director tom kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting dark comedy shot on a shoestring budget yet had the flavor of the early coen brother s film blood simple and throw in some monty python flavorings to boot needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next expect more good things to come from this writer director actor 
i saw this years ago on pbs it was very difficult to watch so real to watch this small family struggle in the winter was heart rending no time for courting fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders to the grindstone and make it work this was based on the woman s actual diary which i read many years later she said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and all their bothers and sisters had to work the farm to feed themselves she learned to mow which was not lady like she was afraid that no prince charming would want a woman with sun browned calloused hands but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow and she was happy to do it both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home it was so so sad when the baby died of course if they had it today i am sure it would have been fine that only makes the tragedy extra sad i was crying so hard but then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf spring is on its way and life goes on in her diary she did have two more boys and they lived 
portrays the day to day stark reality of survival on a ranch in the old west outstanding acting by both principal actors this doesn t even feel like a movie you feel like you re there animal activists should beware many scenes are obviously not just realistic they are real 
i saw heartland when it was first released in and i have just seen it again it improves with age heartland is not just for lovers of indie films at a time when most american films are little more than cynical attempts to make money with cgi pyrotechnics and or vulgarity heartland holds up as a slice of american history it is also a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern urbanized americans are nothing in this film is overstated or stagey no one declaims any hollywood movie speeches the actors really inhabit their roles this really feels like a small film but really it is bigger than most multizillion dollar hollywood productions the film is based on the lives of real people in elinore randall conchata ferrell who has never done anything better than this a widow with a year old daughter jerrine megan folsom is living in denver but wants more opportunities she advertises for a position as housekeeper the ad is answered by clyde stewart rip torn one of our most under appreciated actors a scots born rancher himself a widower with a homestead outside of burnt fork wyoming elinore accepts the position seven dollars a week and moves up to wyoming with her daughter she and her daughter move into stewart s tiny house on the property it is rolling treeless rangeland a place of endless vistas where the silence is broken only by the sounds made by these people and their animals it s guaranteed to make a person feel small the three characters go for long periods without seeing another human soul what is worse stewart turns out to be taciturn to the point of being almost silent i can t talk to the man elinore complains to grandma landauer you d better learn before winter replies grandma grandma lilia skala is one of the only two other characters who are seen more than fleetingly she came out to wyoming from germany with her husband many years before and runs her ranch alone now that she is also widowed grandma is their nearest neighbor and the local midwife and still she lives ten miles away the other supporting character is jack the hired hand barry primus elinore s routine and her employer s is one of endless backbreaking labor where there are no modern conveniences and where everything must be made fixed or done by hand this is the real meat of the film watching the ordinary life of these ranchers as they struggle against nature to wrest a living from the land but despite the constant toil and fatigue elinore is always looking for other opportunities she learns that the tract adjacent to stewart s is unclaimed impulsively she files a claim on the property twelve dollars or almost two weeks pay meaning that if she lives on it and she must actually live there and works it for ten years she will get the deed to it naturally stewart learns what she has done with merciless logic he points out that with no money no livestock no credit and no assets she has no chance of succeeding he then offers a solution he proposes marriage the stunned elinore realizes that this is the only real alternative and accepts we think that stewart s proposal is purely machiavellian he wants the land and the free labor but we see that in fact he is genuinely fond of elinore and they grow together as a couple she becomes pregnant she goes into labor in the middle of a midwinter blizzard clyde travels for hours on horseback through the storm the ten miles to grandma s and the ten miles back only to announce that grandma wasn t there this is more like real life than is pleasant folks elinore has the baby all by herself with no help whatsoever their son is still an infant when he gets sick and dies they lose half their livestock to the vicious winter they struggle on the last sequence in the film is supposed to be optimistic the birth of a calf clyde calls elinore urgently to help him deliver the calf instead of being head first the calf is in a footling breech presentation he and elinore must physically pull the calf out of the birth canal there is no cgi animatronics trickery fakery or special effects what you see is what happened folks a calf is born on a bed of straw in a wooden barn by lamplight with that the film does not so much end as simply stop leaving the viewer unsatisfied but after a while you appreciate the film as a whole not just for its ending this little gem rewards patience and thoughtfulness it will be watchable long after most of the films of the last generation have long been forgotten 
don t say i didn t warn you but your gonna laugh probably enough to hurt your stomach sure it s got some blood splattering all in good fun though so it s got no budget who needs a budget when you got a script like this take the time and check this out well worth a two hour viewing if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to live 
an excellent series masterfully acted and directed but unloved i am told by mr deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation it is now only viewable in private collections and via the british film institute at special request very unfortunate as ian holm s nuanced portrayal of the weary but determined bernard samson is superb one of his very best performances the supporting cast including the young amanda donohoe and hugh fraser are superb with mel martin playing the conflicted and traitorous wife and michael degen as the mercurial werner the story positively simmers with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the great game 
i watched the presentation of this on pbs in the u s when it originally aired in assuming the miniseries was available on dvd i purchased first editions of all three books last year since then i have been searching for the series on internet movie sites today i found this web site i will give up the search i too would like to buy this complete episodes miniseries after buying the dvds i would read each book then watch the episodes for that book that is what i did with john lecarre s karla trilogy and larry mcmurty s texas ranger trilogy does anyone have any suggestions for great books or book series that became very good tv miniseries or movie series that are now available on dvd 
i agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the spy genre my husband and i were captivated by it when it first aired in the us and watched every episode i tried at that time to purchase the series i did tape all of it but was told by wgbh that it was not available i even considered writing to ian holm to see if he might have a copy like others i purchased and read the deighton series in part to understand the complicated plot if the original version ever comes available on dvd i ll be among the first in line to snap up a copy ian holm s portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous bernard samson was amazing he is always amazing 
 thieves and liars presents us with a very naturalistic depiction of the levels of corruption that affect many puerto ricans and force them to make difficult if not impossible choices about their and their loved ones lives the cast is excellent considering that some are non professional actors an excellent choice that augments the level of reality in the film the photography propels the story without intrusion as it should be in this type of film the script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of the boricuas in a very deep way sometimes it feels like you re watching a documentary watching this film you feel as if you ve secretly entered the real puerto rican society and stand invisibly watching it implode i loved it 
a fragment in the life of one of the first female painters to achieve historical renown artemisia tells the true story of a young italian woman s impassioned pursuit of artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters the film features sumptuous costuming and sets and a good cast and acting however it is muddled in its attempt to depict the esoterics of the art and the time and is uninspired in its representation of the passion of the artist as painted on canvas and explored through her involvements with men a good film for those interested in renaissance painting or period films 
i thought this movie was stunning with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi artemisia gentileschi cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully with tentative yet confidant mannerisms her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch although not each character was overtly beautiful this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time overall i thought this film was fantastic 
this is a film about th century italian artists and one artist in particular a woman artemisia an unheard of profession for females at that time and she dared to paint the male nude detailing his unique musculature the camera work is principally indoors for that is where the artists mainly worked there are some great shots close ups by candle light suggest the beautiful work of the classical painters and it is fascinating to watch the painters and their students supported by elaborate scaffolding brushing in details of religious frescoes it is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film costumes faces make up are quite superbly authentic because the italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries the beautiful artemisia is urged by her father to study under the great florentine artist tassi who has become expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting something very new but the unsuspecting artemisia is introduced to more than new techniques in painting after posing for her tassi violently rapes her her father is outraged court proceedings follow this romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending the outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail scenes such as women running across a field with the wind billowing their voluminous clothing add wonderful effects artemisia says she paints to please herself her father paints to please others as for this film it will please most i think 
channel is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels this show was certainly a naughty one the presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show four time bafta winning and british comedy award winning also twice nominated graham norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this it had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it they basically had an adult idea which would either gross humiliate or humour the guest but some are not for the faint hearted they had women playing the recorder with their parts men using their dicks to play a xylophone women weeing upwards in the bath men with or without pants under their kilts and many more gross but hilarious ideas this is just for adults but enjoy it it won the bafta twice for best entertainment programme or series it won the british comedy awards for best comedy entertainment programme also nominated best comedy talk show it won an emmy for episode and it won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show it was number on the greatest funny moments very good 
the case of the scorpion s tail is a highly stylish giallo directed by sergio martino who appears to be a giallo master second only to dario argento ernesto gastaldi wrote this fabulous who dunnit quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery it also makes sense in the end a big plus cause that s not always the case for these giallo s as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless red herrings and ultimate solutions here the less you know about the plot the better pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography the catchy music score the gorgeous females anita strindberg is a goddess brutal murders black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few in most parts it s decently acted goerge hilton his usually suave self and others do fairly well martino directs with a sure hand keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces if you re a giallo fan this is a must see if you like well written and suspenseful thrillers in general this comes highly recommended 
a fine martino outing this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads george hilton and anita strindberg for me the jig saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists enjoyable twists it has to be said sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london athens and greek coastal locations a super finale set upon aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all 
sergio martino is a great director who has contributed a lot to italian genre cinema and as far as i am considered his gialli from the s are the undisputed highlights in his impressive repertoire la coda dello scorpione aka the case of the scorpion s tale of is one of these impressive films martino has contributed to italian horror s most original sub genre and another proof that the man is a master of atmosphere style and suspense my personal favorite of the martino films i ve seen so far is still the insanely brilliant your vice is a locked room and only i have the key of followed by torso and the strange vice of mrs wardh all of which i personally like even more than this one that s purely a matter of personal taste however as la coda dello scorpione is an equally excellent film that is essential for every fan of italian horror cinema and suspense in general the film which delivers tantalizing suspense from the very beginning has a complex and gripping plot that begins with the mysterious demise of a millionaire who has died in a plane crash insurance investigator peter lynch george hilton is assigned to verify the circumstances the insurance company which is due to pay a large sum to the deceased man s wife soon after lynch begins to investigate a person is brutally killed which is just the beginning of a series of murders the case of the scorpion s tail excellently delivers all the elements a great giallo needs the film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning the score by bruno nicolai is brilliant the plot is wonderfully convoluted and the killer s identity remains a mystery until the end regular giallo leading man george hilton once again delivers an excellent performance in the lead sexy anita strindberg is absolutely ravishing in the female lead the includes the great luigi pistilli one of the most brilliant regulars of italian genre cinema of the s and s and alberto de mendoza another great actor who should be familiar to any lover of italian cinema athens where most of the film takes place is actually a great setting for a giallo the atmosphere is constantly gripping and the photography great and bruno nicolai s ingenious score makes the suspense even more intense long story short la coda dello scorpione is another excellent giallo from sergio martino and an absolute must see for any lover of the sub genre stylish suspenseful and great in all regards 
i m really tempted to reward the case of the scorpion s tail with a solid out of rating but that would largely be because i think italian horror cinema of the s is so much better than the cheesy crap i usually watch but even without an extra point for nostalgia this is still a genuine masterwork and earning a high rating for its excellently convoluted story uncanny atmosphere blood soaked killing sequences and superb casting choices in my humble opinion this is actually sergio martino s finest giallo and that has got to mean something as the strange vice of mrs wardh all the colors of the dark torso and your vice is a locked room and only i have the key are all top notch genre achievements as well but this film is just a tad bit superior with its ultra compelling plot revolving on an insurance fraud gone madly out of control following her husband s peculiar death in a plane explosion lisa baumer promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and she s eager to leave the country as soon as possible due to the bizarre circumstances the insurance company puts their best investigator peter lynch on the case and he follows her to greece there lisa becomes the target of many assaults and the case s mysteriousness increases when it turns out several people are hunting for the money i m always overly anxious when briefly summarizing gialli because i don t want to risk giving away essential plot elements in the case of the scorpion s tail the events take an abrupt and totally unexpected turn before the story is even halfway and i certainly don t want to ruin this for you many red herrings follow after that but sergio martino always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and even though not a satisfying the denouement is at least surprising it s also a very stylish film with imaginative camera work and excellent music by bruno nicolai everyone s favorite giallo muse edwige fenech oddly didn t make it to this cast she stars in no less than other supreme martino gialli but anita strindberg lizard in a woman s skin who saw her die is a more than worthy replacement for her the charismatic and hunky george hilton is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and duh ladies man deluxe if you re a fan of giallo don t wait as long as i did to watch this film 
 dance fools dance is an early crawford gable vehicle from crawford plays a bonnie jordan a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties booze and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother william blakewell penniless bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith her brother goes to work for bootleggers the head man is jake luva portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook later of course he would turn into a romantic hero but in the early s mgm used him as a bad guy not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity bonnie cozies up to luva gable and crawford made a great team her facial expressions are a little on the wild side but that along with her dancing is one of the things that makes the movie fun look for cliff edwards the voice of jiminy cricket as bert it s always interesting to see the precode movies and dance fools dance is no exception 
well made and stylish while still ultimately making sense this thriller would work better for non giallo fans to get interested in the genre than the later argento entries which go overboard in all directions for fans of these crazed italian thrillers they will appreciate george hilton and the turns his character takes and what he s put through the camera work is fresh with dashes of graphic violence and odd but appropriate choices and a good not overblown music score as well the less you know about the story the better to make it work the only thing lacking in keeping this from being a great sergio martino directed giallo is that the story doesn t have that extra sexual or psychological or both element to put it over the top it s more a routine mystery the characters are well defined but live or die according to the plot not according to their own virtues and flaws the recent dvd release is beautiful looking and definitely the way to see the film unless these ever get art house screenings which seems unlikely 
i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty blood rites as blood rites was entirely awful i really wasn t expecting much from this film but actually it would seem that trash director andy milligan has outdone himself this time as seeds of sin tops blood rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation the plot is actually quite similar to blood rites as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and of course there is an inheritance at stake the film is shot in black and white and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic the curious dr humpp there s barely any gore on display and the director seems keener to focus on sex with themes of incest and hatred seeping through the acting is typically trashy but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation director andy milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful the plot is paper thin and most of the film is filler but the music is catchy and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves as most are somewhat erotic overall this is not a great film but it s likely to appeal to the cult fan and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality blood rites 
first saw this movie in about and absolutely died laughing through it it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends and we d quote from it at the drop of a hat i m going home in a bag needless to say the humor is still there years later it s become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film good thing you can still buy it off ebay i ve found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek and this movie provides it all pathos suspense unrequited love nobility and the list goes on royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller i remember seeing him in the faces of dr lao as a bad guy who met a bad end here you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning if you aren t careful you ll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments little subtle costume digs at other sci fi movies and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e coyote don t spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie people this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking and shouldn t be offensive to anyone well maybe stupid people but they won t know they re being mocked now if you ll excuse me i m gonna go get a zag nut bar ramsay rc cowlishaw karaoke dj entertainer
there are few really hilarious films about science fiction but this one will knock your sox off the lead martian s jack nicholson take off is side splitting the plot has a very clever twist that has be seen to be enjoyed this is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all make some popcorn and have a great evening 
this movie is just plain silly almost every scene has some bit of humor running gags slapstick and great jokes the acting isn t that great and the plot is cliche but the jokes more than make up for that if you have a chance to see this movie i recommend that you do 
this is one of joan crawford s best talkies it was the first gable crawford pairing and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a sizzling team leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co stars the film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who after their father loses everything in the stock market crash must fend for themselves and work for a living life is hard in the depression and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile and they resort to underworld activity joan crawford is excellent as the socialite turned moll she s smart complex and believable she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors early talkie acting style clark gable is a diamond in the rough masculine and gruff as the no nonsense gangster who becomes involved with crawford s character the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in a free soul securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgm if you like crawford in this type of role don t miss paid which she did a year earlier which is also among her best early talkie performances 
i found the memorable quotes searching for video clips they forgot one of my favorites old person you know i remember the first time they played that thing old person you remember pterodactyls old person and i can remember you fell for that hook line and sinker old person oh i did not old lady you did so you put a big bucket on your head and took off with them army boys to fight martians old person ain t you dead yet 
this movie is funny and suitable for any age it is definitely family type entertainment the cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid western town of big bean illinois where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement pre invasion of the decade is the new and only exit ramp from the interstate the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians but these martians are totally inept despite being well equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons including one set on eradicating the martians too the martians dead pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them leave earth j j anderson playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines watch this movie for laugher and entertainment thought provoking it isn t but subtle and enjoyable it is 
normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to orson welles but here is a sci fi comedy quoting the war of the worlds broadcast and it is gold the very concept of a small bunch of diminutive aggressive and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in halloween dress is magnificent don t be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids movie it is unsophisticated it isn t there s a lot of hidden treasure a gem 
basically this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do rather than having to sit through it for two hours or as in my case you see it as a kult hit one of those movies wherein the humour the plot the acting is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it trusting the director well the reward is u laugh your a of the fact that u have to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even more funny because u get the impression the director isn t even aware of how funny his movie is which doesn t seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called spaced invaders 
laughs adventure a good time a killer soundtrack oscar worthy acting and special effects animitronics like none other what else could you want in a movie if you see this will be on the telly watch it otherwise run out now to rent it 
joan crawford had just begun her working girl makes good phase with the dynamic paid she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering because they were clinging to characters that had been the in thing a few years before but were now becoming passe joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon of course if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it that was alright this film starts out with a spectacular house boat party bonnie jordan joan crawford is the most popular girl there especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear however when bonnie s father has a heart attack because of loses on the stock market both bonnie and her brother rodney william bakewell realise who their real friends are after bob townsend lester vail a poor man s johnny mack brown offers to do the right thing and marry her they had just spent a night together when bonnie declared with abandon that she wants love on approval she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job she finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well her working buddy is bert scranton cliff edwards and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer jake luva clark gable rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces spilling the beans to the first person he sees drinking at the bar which happens to be bert he is then forced to kill bert and after wards he goes into hiding the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find bert s killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jake s clubs joan does a very lively dance to accordian joe much to sylvie s disgust the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying bonnie tearfully phones in her story this is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all natalie moorehead who as sylvie shared a famous cigarette scene with gable early in the film was a stylish other woman who had her vogue in the early thirties william bakewell had a huge career he had started as a teenager in a douglas fairbanks film in the mid s a lot of his roles though were weak spineless characters in this film he played the weak brother and was completely over shadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable maybe that was why he never became a star highly recommended 
i loved this movie you have to respect midgets that dressed up like tiny martians sure the story may have been thin at times but you can t take away from the way it was done i used to watch this over and over again when i was its a kids movie and besides it has some of the greatest quotes ever blanzee s home on the range rendition is awesome very well done if you ask me of 
 i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing the small town sheriff laments this happens a lot in chicago his deputy asks well no not really the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion and conclude they need to get in on the action what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the martian s haphazard attempts to conquer the town of big bean il everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes except for the sheriff s daughter and her friend a kid in a duck suit the martians themselves are comical and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on it s a fun family movie 
 spaced invaders is one of the funniest movies i ve ever seen i don t understand why this movie didn t get better critics it s funny harmless and sweet i first watched it when i was and i really fell in love with it days later i got it on vhs p till today i ve shown it to many friends and they all liked it but nobody knew the movie before i think that s the problem nearly nobody knows it so nearly nobody can like it this movie never got a real chance that s sad si has really the potential of a comedy like monsters inc or spaceballs ok enough displeasure what i really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh your head off watch it even if you don t get mad about it it s worth watching prepare to laugh earth scum 
after mistaking a halloween re broadcast of orson welles classic radio adaptation of war of the worlds for a real martian invasion a group of moronic martians shows up on earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone this really is often quite good and funny with some decent lines just check the memorable quotes to boot it will most likely appeal to sci fi fans this has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than i expected it to be despite a cast made up of no name stars this may just be the funniest martian invasion ever put to film interestingly enough the martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic action hero sci fi hero stereotype there is cool s teen fighter pilot fearless astronaut brave soldier and kooky scientist fun for the whole family prepare to die earth scum 
this movie was disaster at box office and the reason behind that is innocence of the movie sweetness of the story music was good story is very simple and old but presentation of such story is very good director tried his best abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene soha looks so sweet in the movie rest star cast was simply okay music and all songs are good himesh is impressive as an singer here don t miss this movie its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us abhay best work till date i will give to ahista ahista 
abhay deol meets the attractive soha ali khan and greets her hello sister this sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by shivam nair soha a middle class girl has run away from her home in nainital and come to delhi to marry her lover shayan munshi but shyan doesn t turn up leaving soha heartbroken alone in the big bad world abhay the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable soha and helps her get a job shelter in an old age home slowly romance blooms and soha agrees to marry abhay then shyan re enters into soha s life a sensitively made film with a very unusual story lovingly shot in delhi revolves around the delicate soha this well crafted film has moments which will forever remain etched in one s memory the awkward first kiss abhay s swift apology abhay describing soha as class wali ladki hastily adding that he doesn t love her his gifting a churidar to soha asking her out for a date the music is good the background music excellent in a scene where soha rushes embraces abhay the sound track disappears the stillness conveys both the awkwardness tenderness of the relationship the poignant ending makes for a bitter sweet film the memories of which will linger for a long long time a must see i will rate it 
this period melodrama is one of griffith s earliest claustrophobic films characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and as time went by he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror in the bluntly titled sealed room there is one major difference to the normal plot line in that there truly is no escape griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways first is his use of space while the typical biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets the sealed room features only two adjoining rooms the king s court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb the set design in these shorts is rarely referenced but here it is crucial the court is a large interior with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase actors enter and leave from various directions suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open by contrast the dove cote s back wall is very close to the camera and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confined the second technique on display here is the cross cutting anyone with an interest in griffith s work will probably know about his heavy use and development of cross cutting to build excitement or tension many will also know that strictly speaking it wasn t his invention however what makes griffith s cross cuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other the sealed room contains a good example of what i mean the shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow step by step pace to them with tension building as the wall gets higher this movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers in which marion leonard tears off flower petals one by one as the couple realise their predicament their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wall at this point griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the cross cut the dramatic ride to the rescue here absent was later to become a standard climax to griffith s pictures 
had this movie been made a few years later i would have given it a lower score however for this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today just don t try to compare this silent film to later silents the industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the th century don t look at all like movies made in the s and beyond this movie is minutes long about average for most films back then and is a variation of the edgar allen poe story the cask of amontillado while many are familiar with the story i won t elaborate further as i don t want to ruin the film just suffice to say that it s very creepy 
this is the true story of how three british soldiers escaped from the german prisoner of war pow camp stalag luft iii during the second world war this is the same pow camp that was the scene for the great escape which resulted in the murder of re captured officers by the gestapo and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name while the other pows in stalag luft iii are busy working on their three massive tunnels known as tom dick harry two enterprising british prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom the idea to build their version of the trojan horse came to them while they were discussing classic attempts for escape and observing some pows playing leap frog in the compound initially containing one and later with two pows hidden inside the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position near the fence on a daily basis while volunteer pows vaulted over the horse the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire under the wire and into the woods the story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping pows faced while traveling through germany and occupied europe after they emerged from the tunnel all three pows who tried to escape actually hit home runs escaped successfully to their home base the wooden horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a pow breakout the movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two pows traveled in their escape made with far less a budget than the great escape the wooden horse is more realistic if not more exciting than the great escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the pows to make good their escape the story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie the wooden horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees eric williams and is by far the best pow escape story ever made into a movie some of the actual pows were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in stalag luft iii i give this movie a well deserved ten 
in a group of raf officers including eric wiiliams decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard in it was decided to film his account and it kick started a peculiar british film genre the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched there are no great dramatic moments but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn t give way for unlikely drama jump cuts or jacked up somethings about to happen music it is utterly of its time and works beautifully leo glenn anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and i suspect non actors without exception all are constantly mono tonal and quiet they keep emotion out of their roles as so many were until recently ex service i suspect they recreated their war time roles as officers and gentlemen this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension on the contrary unlike most wartime escape films the story doesn t end at the barbed wire and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end 
look this is quite possibly one of the best movies america has to offer the rest of the world to hate this movie is to hate freedom itself i remember that the early s were a time of uncertainty the economy was weak communism threatened us all and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty out of that confusion came a hero stroker ace ned beatty s performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness his triumph is an inspiration to all the on screen chemistry between burt and loni draws obvious comparisons to brad and jennifer jim nabors is a poet go see this movie tonight 
this is a hilarious film burt reynolds is a nascar star who signs a sponsorship contract with ned beatty s chicken pit restaurants the contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in it such as forcing burt to wear a chicken suit during the race jim nabors is his not quite convincing chief mechanic loni anderson oh yeah is assigned by beatty to keep reynolds honest and strictly adhering to the contract this is a funny film in which burt proves that he ain t too proud i like it 
actually goldie hawn is from washington takoma park maryland but i digress this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn the story is interesting but it s highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot s life it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh possible spoiler ahead it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up and the speech she made at the end beautiful too bad not many people have guts like that in real life 
this is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word it tells a tail that here in greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is sure it has some extremes but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art it is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them the film has a deeper understanding of greek ways of life stereotypes and social structure unlike most greek films that have a certain fast food mainstream audience this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings i am not a big fan of traditional music either but i wouldn t like to hear anything else when it was played during the film if someone told me to say something against this film i d define the following sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut i guess the editing had to cut it up to fit the hours and a bit for the theatres anyway i could write more and more to express my thought over this but i guess u have to see it and discuss it with a friend a must see
after having seen a lot of greek movies i feel very suspicious against most of them but after watching this i felt astonished the movies is great without a big try you cannot claim that the screenplay is so great or the photography is perfect or something technical it s a real story and it is happening in greek rural areas in places forgotten from god the movie is like a punch in the stomach and i would really wish that things are not like this it obviously talks about the xenophobia of the greek people the ignorance to anything different the problem of this guy is not that he is an ex convicted the problem is that he is not one of these people he is different and they do not want them that s why all the good things he is doing turn boomerang to him and also speaks about the apathy of the people because there are some people who are against the hunting of the king but they do not dare to say their opinion in the end you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the society being religious and trying to act like god says but at the same time acting so unfairly to the king this shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or their beliefs according to the established system in the end you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story meaning that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them if you want to remain different and even alone you are lost and it is not far from reality i think it is tragic that the story is real and this should be a bell for everybody no comment for the main actor because he is already given an award and i believe that his play was great small comment for hatzisavvas plays the policeman he is like a dinosaur he has played a lot of roles and i m sure that this role for him was very easy but he plays it so great that you cannot deny him a big bravo i definitely recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a good greek movie 
years ago many big studios promoted serial films that were shown in movie theaters s in between the actual features along with a newsreel of current events plus cartoons especially on a saturday afternoon the parents loved it mostly the return of chandu was a episode serial where chandu bela lugosi the mysterious mr wong is a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of lemuria to rescue the kidnapped princess of egypt nadji maria alba dr terror s house of horrors princess nadji is held captive by the black magic cult of ubasti who believe that she is a reincarnation of their long dead goddess ossana these episode serials take you way back in time and are very well produced considering we are talking about 
this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year i didn t see any cameos in the movie but it is still pretty good it is similar to anchorman in the humor department but i think this is a better put together movie it actually has a point if you are going to see a whole bunch of t a you will be disappointed just a well put together movie if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor you will find this to be a really good movie i definitely think that ebert and roeper s review of this movie is right on i mean i don t really like ebert on most movies but this is the movie that i will agree about the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie yea sure you get laughed at when it is found out about but it still suggests that you wait steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet it is still funny 
steve carrel proves himself to be a great leading man in this wonderful original raunchy breath of fresh air i about wet myself at how geniusly hilarious it was basically the movie s title says it all andy stitzer is a year old male who works at an electronics store he is a bit of a nerd who loves videogames and comics and has the biggest collection his peers that work in the store with him find out that he s a virgin during a rather sex dialogue filled poker game and then andy has to go through a rather funny as hell odyessy of rude sexual awakenings but always screwing up which leads to him not losing his virginity but he eventually gets lucky in the very end leave the little ones at home but take the entire family to see this awesome romantic adult comedy it will have you hooked and cracking up from the very beginning and by the time it is over you will be wishing you wore your extra thick absorbent undergarments only other thing i can say about it is too bad steve carrel wasn t recognized as a leaving man years ago he is definitely gonna win best breakthrough male performance in next years mtv movie awards you can bet your hard earned dollar on that people i give this one a perfect 
well let me just say something about these actors they really were a good decision and from experience having actors really brings the dialogue to life if you walk into this even fifteen minutes late you ll be in for a shock the movie will have already began you don t want to miss the first few jokes assuming you came to not miss any jokes wow i have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending not to be harsh i mean i loved it but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped but i m getting ahead of myself lets start with the very start of it when it began the plot outline goes like this there is this man and not to give away any spoilers spoiler alert he hasn t had any sex ever they use this plot device to set the story moving and there are intentionally or not it could go either way some funny situations had by the main characters some containing irony and jokes and awkward situations you know the director uses the advancements in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog some music and jokes to make a funny movie designed as a comedy where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between i went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what i already knew about it and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy ten stars 
spoilers sex huh it s one of the most basic parts of human life yet do we ever take it too seriously people always want more even those who get it on a daily basis and if you are unlucky there are potential life changing creating consequences ironically people claim we are all starting to have sex at a younger and younger age despite victorians getting married and having children in their early teens so it must be increasingly difficult for those who get to a point as virgins in steve carell s first big screen lead he plays a man who has gotten to without managing it treating us to countless lude and extreme sex related incidents not to mention more profanity than an episode of eurotrash the general plot of the film and it s principle doesn t sound funny it s a pleasant surprise therefore that for all the inappropriate failed jokes there are an incredibly large number of ones which hit the mark and leave the audience in hysterics andy stitzer carell is a nice guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament at the same time though he blatantly takes life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member andy s friends discover his secret at the age of andy is still a virgin now for multiple reasons but mostly pity the three men paul rudd seth rogen and romany malco all offer andy advice with one goal in mind to put him out of his misery and get him laid one of the few good things about anchorman it was only going to be a matter of time before steve carell got himself a lead of his own impressively in the year old virgin he doesn t disappoint showing the hopeless shy virgin to perfection carell is a revelation as he gradually grows increasingly confident as the advice begins to help carell is not alone however in his performance rudd rogen malco and catherine keener as the love interest are all superb rudd is a personal favourite as the love sick david who falls apart at multiple times and shares the finest scene with rogen as the two argue over homosexuality the biggest surprise about this film is not the way that so many of the jokes hit the mark but actually the clever way that it flips the message on it s head obviously designed for conservative america the film s entire tone evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest into one of safe sex and abstinence the virgin doesn t need sex to make his life complete he just needs confidence and true love a worthy message to preach and a considerable improvement on the one you expect to see at the beginning of the film it s weird to see a crude comedy which is consistently funny and well acted but low and behold year old virgin is just that throw in a well meaning message too and you re well on the way to a top class comedy a surprising joy 
this movie starts out hilarious from about the second mark and continues it throughout the movie i cannot recall a scene where i didn t turn to look at people laughing with me he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he dressed the comedic parts were great to see from actors not very big or popular as you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated on imdb i think it should be in lets put it this way i haven t seen this funny of a movie since american pie or the original vacation see it if you want a laugh i give this movie of the highest thumbs up i have ever given since i found out about imdb great movie site 
this movie is a riot i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies i ve seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny but this one is wall to wall great lines i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in the movie was non stop until the end when they did the minutes of sentimental plot clean up other than that it s a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations i d like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don t get all the jokes the first time around you have to see it two or three times to get it all in as far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit it s choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that all the characters are great it s not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable no victims in this movie also thank god they got a year old actress to play his girlfriend catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film you just wish that women like her really existed she s not a like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it i assure you the trailer does not do it justice they do not give away all the good jokes just some of the mediocre ones oh and one more thing i hope critics put this on their top ten list many of them complain that comedies don t get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don t put it on their list this means you ebert 
the key to the year old virgin is not merely that andy stitzer is a year old virgin but rather the manner in which steve carell presents him as one in a genre of crass comedy that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters the year old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent heartfelt script that doesn t use its protagonist as the butt end of cruel jokes that andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke in fact as it is a curiosity carell a veteran of team ferrell in anchorman and an ex daily show castmember uses the concept of the film to expand his character we get to understand why andy is the way he is it s the little things that make this film work when andy s co worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend andy describes his failed efforts at cooking when andy rides his bike to work he signals his turns he doesn t just adorn his home with action figures he paints them and talks to them and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood a lesser comedy wouldn t even begin to focus on all of these things the plot is fairly simplistic andy s co worker pals find out he s never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman it s a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility andy s friends are a complement to his neurotic nature david paul rudd has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her jay romany malco is a womanizing ladies man and cal seth rogen is a tattooed sexaholic their attempts at getting andy in the sack backfire numerous times and each time leaves andy feeling less and less optimistic finally andy meets single mom trish played by catherine keener and much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren t worth it he falls in love with her they begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days trish being unaware that andy is still a virgin the year old virgin was directed by judd apatow the man who produced anchorman and the cable guy and began the short lived cult tv show freaks and geeks apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor and the script co written by carell offers plenty however in the end the most interesting and indeed surprising aspect of the year old virgin is its maturity by now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics and even i was surprised by its warm reception but after seeing the film it s easy to understand why we like andy we care about him he s not just some cardboard cutout sex comedy clich he s a real living breathing person his neurotic traits combine the best of woody allen with childish naivety his friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet it strikes a chord with the audience although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor it doesn t offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on screen the best sex comedies work this way from risky business to american pie and that is the major difference between something like the year old virgin and days and nights 
i m not quite sure if the term serious comedy applies to this movie im not even sure if this can be applied on the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin therefore i considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as serious comedies does the year old virgin fit into this guild that is finally up to you but in my opinion this is a very funny movie you get to laugh a lot plus it delivers a social commentary through some really great characters and situations i m pretty there is more than one year old virgin out there and even the people whom do not exactly fit this specifications may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie especially men the story as the title says it is about andy a shy silent guy whom collects action figures watches survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is asia kal is andy s co worker at smarttech he believes andy to be a psychopath until andy s secret is revealed kal is clearly a sexual pervert but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre david is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex girlfriend whom ran away with another guy and jay a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught acts i m pretty sure most youngsters from to have already watched this film but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it so in case you haven t seen it and will enjoy a little laugh with social commentary than go to your video store and rest from those deep and depressing independent films it also includes dvd bonuses which you ll really see from top to bottom 
a pretty average movie but a brave one from ms hawn to promote this vehicle as exec producer as a starring vehicle although she ends up vindicated she is willing to portray herself as the dizzy bimbo how many other a listed actresses have subjected themselves to butt injury pratfalls since this movie not many does this mean the female butt cannot be funny goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona ventures in projects other won t sandra bullock occasionally goes there for example miss congeniality but nicole kidman would never cop the pratfall a wonderful performer great to see some of my favorite actors chris sarandon cliff deyoung notably 
the year old virgin steve carell catherine keener paul rudd romany malco seth rogen elizabeth banks leslie mann jane lynch gerry bednob shelley malil kat dennings hysterically funny high concept comedy about the titular andy stitzer wonderfully played by perennial second banana carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the a list a tech services rep for an electronics store in southern california who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co worker buddies rudd malco rogen each one degree funnier than the next determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost what follows is an unlikely yet very warm hearted romance with a vivacious mother the marvelous keener having lots of fun here leading to add more fuel to the fires within andy a surprisingly good spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy the funniest since there s something about mary with a shrewdly observant script by director judd apatow and carell that features some astoundingly gut busting sequences including a scathingly accurate david caruso joke homophobic debunking ribbing send ups of date a paloozas and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb a true winner and an instant classic the funniest film of the year 
only once in a while do we get an r rated comedy that gets everyone s time and attention it s an even rarer case when the critics will like it i just came back from the year old virgin and i can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs of my life i went to a showing and every row was filled not only that everyone laughed their ass off the whole time through it s two hours of non stop laughing i dare you to see this film and to not laugh the plot is simple a man is forty years old and he is a virgin yet behind this simple five second joke we are given a deep complex story that is not only one of the funniest you ll ever witness but has genuine lessons behind it steve carell stars as andy stitzer the year old virgin we have known steve carell as in my opinion one of the best scene thieves of all time stealing hilarious scenes from bruce almighty and especially anchorman steve carell has come a long way as finally and proudly is given his moment to shine as the star no one will forget his name once they witness this pervasively funny gut busting roll in the aisle hilarious comedy the beauty about the film is it isn t stupid the brilliant writing of judd apatow and steve carell genuinely has purpose and it s not just one hell of a story to tell behind the crudeness and vulgar non stop ride of the film comes an important lesson to be learned although not presented in the best way possible the film gives us more than a purely enjoyable time its gut busting attitude will have you laughing the whole time through while we simultaneously see the real life struggles of people like andy and his fellow co workers the end couldn t have been better not only does it deliver what we are promised but it gives one of the most memorable finishing numbers a comedy has ever seen it would have been perfect if there was vince vaughn and owen wilson in there cameoing somehow but you can t win em all now can you finally i think as roger ebert put it catherine keener gives an unexplainable perfect performance as trish the one woman andy has his heart truly for not only does she also give us laughs but it is crazy to see how brightly she fuels the story she was cast perfected in the role and her and carell have terrific not to mention hilarious chemistry on screen canadian ratings wise once again ontario slips away with a a while british columbia alberta and manitoba all slapped the year old virgin with an a the same thing happened with four brothers in my opinion the second best film of the year and i can honestly say that i love ontario more and more so for that to all you fellow teenagers out there in the states good luck sneaking in overall steve carell gives one of the funniest performances i ve ever seen and just about everyone in the cast distributes to the non stop laughter everyone will love the year old virgin this summer and i encourage everyone to see it as fast as humanly possible it is the best comedy of the year hands down it beats all over the longest yard the wedding crashers and of course apatow and carell s last memorable comedy anchorman it is a comic masterpiece and deserves the remarkable amount of praise from the critics who have been loving it every single one of my favourite critics loved it and it deserves a spot on the imdb top right away steve carell is a huge star watch one of the brightest ones of the summer right now my rating objectively subjectively eliason a 
all right here s the deal if you re easily offended then you might want to stay far far away from this one there are some painfully funny moments in the movie but i probably blushed about as much as i laughed actually i probably blushed more than i laughed and if i wasn t literally blushing on the outside then i was blushing on the inside if there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame whether that s a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder i suppose i will not deny that i laughed quite a bit but this is a movie that i simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter if i were to say this movie is hilarious go check it out and some sweet little old church going lady heads to the theater and has a heart attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations well that s just something i don t need on my conscience so how raunchy is it hmm try about times worse than the wedding crashers honestly my mom would ve walked out during the first scene i feel it s my duty to at least warn you of what to expect there is some cleverly intelligent comedy here but that s what i come to expect from the man judd apatow who had a hand in both freaks and geeks and undeclared i m all for making fun of michael mcdonald the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give kenny rogers a run for his money paul rudd proclaiming if i hear ya mo be there one more time i ll ya mo burn this place down is hilarious but it s one of those things that the majority of the audience won t appreciate and when we see a quick second flashback of steve carrell singing along to cameo s word up i laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it strangely enough despite the raunch there s an admirable moral to the story the movie doesn t portray carrell as some freaky loser just because he s a virgin he s really portrayed as a likable admirable character sure he s a little weird after all he has a framed asia poster more videogames than an asian kid and a toy collection that features the million dollar man s boss but we re never led to believe that there s actually anything wrong with the fact that he s a virgin as odd as it may seem there s a bit of an it s ok to wait message but man oh man please be warned that this pushes its r rating about as far as it can go that was certainly apatow s intention according to him he just let some of the guys particularly rogen and malco improv and talk the way they normally talk all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty if you can handle that or talk that way yourself then you ll love the movie i m not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes i find that subtle clever humor is much more entertaining than about uses of the f word or fratboy sex discussions but that s me like i said there are some absolutely hysterical moments here but you have to ask yourself if they re worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you re likely to ever see at the theater i just don t know how interested most women will be in what s discussed by men while playing poker honestly ladies you might not want to know if you ve ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross well this gives you a good idea there you go my humble honest take on what to expect be that your guide it definitely should not be seen with your sunday school class mama grandmama any family members of the opposite sex children of any age or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion if you d see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable 
this is one of the funnier films i ve seen it had it s crude moments but they were full of charm it s altmanesque screenplay brilliant physical humour and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life most of us can relate to and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve carell s nipple i truly was surprisingly this is a good natured unabashed comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way catherine keener was terrific as trish and all of steve carell s friends were flawed but amiable and so much fun the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty year old virgin but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first original charming and very funny highly recommended 
i haven t laughed this hard at a movie in a long time i got to go to an advance screening and was thrilled because i had been dying to see it i had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie the audience all shared my laughter and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie kudos to steve carrell who i had already been a fan of he proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy he has a style that i haven t seen before and catherine keener is excellent as always thank god there wasn t a cameo from will ferrell love him but saw him too much this summer there were parts of comedic genius in this movie partly thanks to carrell and partly thanks to the writing also carrell the waxing scene and the speed dater with the obvious problem were absolutely hysterical i will definitely go see year old virgin when it s released my advice go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it 
just came out of a sneak preview for this film it had me laughing every secs the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i hadn t bought that large coke there are definitely some lulls but overall highly entertaining the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in bruce almighty and will ferrell anchorman the legend of ron burgendy in their movies paul rudd is hilarious as always i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas like p s i think that seth rogen should be getting more work because he so freaking talented and engaging leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac however if you re easily offended don t see this movie if you re a rabid feminist don t see this movie and please not matter what even if you think you re one of those hip parents don t take your kids to this movie sure you should let your teens go see this movie just don t watch it with them it would make for some incredibly awkward moments 
a classic series that should be at least repeated or released on dvd billy toth after realising he is adopted after the death of his parents embarks on a journey to find his real parents after various rites of passage his search culminates in the discovery that his fathers identity was stolen and used by a human trafficker in europe if i remember correctly the series ends on the austrian ] ski slopes and a cliff top chase resulting in the death of billys fathers betrayer this series was all filmed on location in various destinations round europe and appeared polished and incredibly well made with some episodes crossing into the realms of film noir and crime thriller the main arc was often eclipsed by the slices of life that billy went through during his years of toiling to find his mother and fathers secrets a class act but underrated and forgotten 
what a relief to find out i am not imagining this programme the summary from taxman is great i too remember finding it haunting and not particularly family viewing i must have been at the time i watched it i think for a girl that age part of attraction was lead s very blond hair and his permanently sad state the theme was played on a flute i recall although i cannot remember how it went i think the intro showed him playing it or maybe he played a flute in the programme and especially when he was sad maybe i am destined never to know how it ended or to see clip or hear the tune but at least i now know it is not just me 
having set the sitcom world alight with father ted arthur matthews and graham linehan s next creation was a forgotten gem for the bbc called hippies although created by the pair the six scripts were written by arthur matthews alone set in london in ray purbs a hippy is the editor of an anarchist magazine his friends are his flat mate the very laid back and cannabis smoking alex his girlfriend is feminist jill and the none too bright hugo simon pegg was superb as ray but he is superb in everything he is in this sitcom had a feel of citizen smith about it ray was very much like wolfie smith trying to beat society but failing miserably at last this sitcom is going to be released on dvd in march i can t wait to buy it as it was on in and has yet been repeated on terrestrial television my memories aren t too good of the sitcom yet i remember two episodes really clearly the first being the opener protesting hippies which i thought was a great start where ray goes on a protest against sandpaper and the other episode was hippy dippy hippies which i think was episode again quite a clear memory about the police sadly the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers i can t think why the bbc commissioned another series but arthur matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction oh well i can t wait for the dvd best episode hippy dippy hippies series episode 
i just want to say that i am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie bravo the spaz bravo this movie is a ridiculous farce of film making especially for a student film i just want to give credit to the spazz for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture and then to comment on it most people i know don t have that kind of time especially so few will end of reading it kudos to you sir anyway the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly i understand the idea behind creating a satire of charlie s angels but why hire such atrocious actresses also what kind of director has himself act write produce and also edit the picture choose one job and put all your love into it man it s such a shame because i hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush again thanks to the spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film people like you are a rare find 
i love this movie out of hands down it is that damn good i am not much of a fan of movies but i gotta tell you this one opened my eyes astounding color and fast energy i was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the zoinks film festival in boston and the story really enveloped me from the start it had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended i wanted more i hope they make a sequel that would be fun my only problem with it is the performance of melissa connor as anya ugh she sucks i ve seen a block of wood pull out a better performance i don t what the director was thinking when he cast her but if you ignore her you can t help but give this movie a big ten 
this is a feel good movie and nothing more and for that it is great fun to watch sure it skims over political issues but so what i am sure she wasn t trying to make good night and good luck here let s not try to make it anything else but what it is light fare and very enjoyable at that do we remember what was like we ve become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not i tend to differ on this point goldie knew this was fun fluff and she went ahead and did it like her lightest fare protocol overboard housesitter wildcats private benjamin seems like old times foul play death becomes her first wives club and the remake of out of towners goldie knows what she is doing she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it goldie just knows herself really well and she knows what she can do really well she has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently i loved her in laugh in and every thing she s ever been in she has never tried to be anything else but who she is and that s that bubbling giggly girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you ve just got to lighten up because before you know it you are old wrinkled and suffering from one of life s inevitable ailments if it even comes that late i appreciate goldie for what she is a lovable comic actress 
i have watched this movie three times the last time i kept skipping around confusing scenes to find resolution for the plot perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because ann s recall of distant events is rather faulty take the young ann grant claire danes here is a young woman who has attended an unnamed college with the scions of a rich family she must have had help to afford this very expensive education but never seems to have any family ties at all she never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions take effect ann shares an evening of passion with her great love harris arden patrick wilson then when harris comforts lila after the tragic death of her brother buddy ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior i must have missed something significant here ann s behavior seems totally inexplicable ann abandons her relationship with harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at lila s wedding despite ann s rejection of harris she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed it was obvious from his behavior that harris was deeply smitten with ann and would have gladly married her a scene showing their chance meeting years after lila s wedding showed that harris still had deep feelings for ann the film showed a pattern for ann s romantic relationships she always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them this pattern held with harris and two husbands in contrast lila married a man she did not love and she remained with her husband until he died perhaps lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail then came the too convenient reappearance of lila ross at ann s bedside apparently ann s nurse was able to extract enough information from ann s last few lucid moments to identify and contact lila none of this communication appeared on the film i kept wondering about the house ann was living in during her final days how did she afford to buy such a house on the meager earnings of her singing career ann always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters on another level i enjoyed the film s setting and music immensely the seaside mansion was just so heartbreakingly beautiful claire danes was luminous as the young ann grant she is really quite a talented singer i much prefer her natural brunette to the bottle blonde look she had in the film extras if only those pesky cgi fireflies would go away i could raise the movie a whole point in my vote 
criticism of the film evening based on the novel by susan minot and adapted for the screen by minot and michael cunningham has been harsh so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try the primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman s fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth that famous actors were given very minor roles that the entire production was over hyped etc for this viewer seeing the film on a dvd in the quiet of the home a very different reaction occurred ann grant lord vanessa redgrave is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man s name harris with her two grown daughters nina toni colette and constance natasha richardson as her daughters sit at her bedside ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend lila mamie gummer a marriage both ann claire danes as the youthful ann and lila s alcoholic brother buddy hugh dancy objected to feeling that lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved harris arden patrick wilson her housekeeper s son who had become a physician harris buddy lila and ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now years later as ann is dying the older lila meryl streep visits ann at the end and the secrets are revealed there are no such things as mistakes life just goes on the film is a delicate mood piece and the script by minot and cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons yes there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady s words such holes are understandable the film is graced by the presence of not only redgrave richardson redgrave s true daughter collette gummer streep s true daughter meryl streep claire danes eileen atkins glenn close hugh dancy and patrick wilson but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances the setting is gorgeous cinematography by gyula pados and the musical score is by the inimitable jan a p kaczmarek lajos koltai being julia directs judge this film on your own grady harp
evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth all the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances with the tremendous cast though one expects stellar acting but in this movie the expectations are exceeded one can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family as one watches the interaction of the family members one s own family memories are immediately brought to mind this is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book usually it is the other way around one reads the book and then wants to see the movie i will definitely obtain a copy of the susan minot book and read it the rhode island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles needless to say now but i recommend evening highly see it you will enjoy it 
so many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so i duly responded here are some remarks vanessa redgrave is great even while lying in bed she also looks very old and i don t think this is achieved with much make up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema goers i think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years claire danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth mamie gummer s resemblance to her mother merly streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that i lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance she is surprisingly good however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor i agree with a previous comment natasha richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face she certainly does not look like how i remember her from previous films nell for example both she and toni collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters their interplay is weak toni collette additionally is way too old for her character glenn close and meryl streep had to have more screen time streep s performance actually is little more than a cameo her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film eileen atkins provides some welcome dry wit especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to redgrave s character as for the men hugh dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed as a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag it is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer patrick wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film he also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people one of them a man are so much smitten by this man the backstory to this should have been developed more the cinematography is excellent as expected however the main summer house set failed to convince me it does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill particularly with its grass patch in the front a bit too cardboard like overall the film is a classy production but a seen it all before cried at it all before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that i expected from a tearjerker however it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time about one s expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not worth trying at least on dvd if not at the movies 
the danes character finally let s buddy have the awful truth leave me alone kiss men if you want to she screams self righteously in front of everyone thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long nice girl this might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that danes pours into this character great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying but hey remember there are no mistakes except maybe seeing this film wait a minute this irony is intended this is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit yes but somehow i doubt that s what the creators of this film had in mind sadly maybe there are a few mistakes after all 
while in her deathbed ann lord vanessa redgrave repeats the name harris and recalls the day on the s when she was an aspirant singer and traveled from new york to be the maid of honor of her wealthy friend lila wittenborn mamie gummer in newport ann grant claire danes is welcomed by lila s alcoholic and reckless brother buddy hugh dancy in the wittenborn s cottage at seaside and he tells her that his sister is in love actually for their friend and servant harris arden patrick wilson who fought in the war and has graduated in medicine later the bride to be confesses her true feelings about harris to ann however when ann meets harris she has a crush on him and they have a brief affair during one night stand while a tragedy happens with buddy meanwhile ann s daughters the insecure and unstable nina mars toni collette and the happy wife and mother constance haverford natasha richardson are worried with their mother and have differences to be resolved evening has one of the best feminine casts i have ever seen in a movie with magnificent performances the resemblance of the stunning mamie gummer with her mother meryl streep is amazing and she has a performance that honors the name of her mother the locations costumes set decoration cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome unfortunately the plot is confused and i have not clearly understood the message of this film why motherhood is so important in the story was constance engendered in the night stand of ann and harris and he would be her father why ann and harris have not stayed together if the guy really loved her like he confesses in their occasional encounter in new york which issues ann lord has resolved after the visit of lila ross was buddy wittenborn bisexual or his love for harris was a fraternal love why nina mars changed her thoughts about motherhood in the end it seems that the screenplay writers or the director failed since they were not able to make sense and fulfillment to the beautiful love story my vote is seven title brazil ao entardecer in the eventide 
 protocol is a hit and miss picture starring goldie hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting arab from an assassination attempt the woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job working for the u s government will the corridors of power in our nation s capital ever be the same hawn is excellent as usual even though protocol isn t as funny as her best film private benjamin but it s still a good movie and i did laugh alot out of four 
this is not a profound movie most of the plot aspects are pretty predictable and tried and true but it was well acted and made some interesting points about what we might regret our mistakes as the movie calls them as we look back over our lives i had not read the book so didn t know much other than it was the story of a dying woman who has strong memories from long ago that she hasn t really shared with anyone thankfully they got a top notch cast meryl streep s daughter mamie gummer plays the young lila and then meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old lila in addition to an amazing resemblance duh the younger actress did a great job perhaps not quite up to her mom s caliber but who is all others in this film were fine although i wish there had been more of glen close and thought the buddy character was alittle too dramatic this is more of a girls movie than for the guys but a good one to see with your mom or your daughter and maybe start some dialog going how hard it is to really know a parent as a person 
i had the pleasure of viewing this beautiful film last night with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing i suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death i have had many such losses and this movie spoke to me one of the major themes is how we don t deal with questions issues stories with our loved ones until it s too late they re too incapacitated or dead before that happens talk to your loved ones listen to and record their stories tell people you love them resolve differences i loved the message that there are no mistakes i love the director s portrayal of the relationship of the two daughters as one of six siblings it s clear to me he understood how complex those relationships are his history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clear what a beautiful movie the casting is outstanding a film not to be missed 
i caught evening in the cinema with a lady friend evening is a chick flick with no apologies for being such but i can say with some relief that it s not so infused with estrogen that it s painful for a red blooded male to watch except for a single instance at the very end of the movie i watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any self indulgent melodrama ladies for their part will absolutely love this movie ann lord is elderly bed ridden and spending her last few days on earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side discomfited by the memories of her past ann suddenly calls out a man s name her daughters have never heard before harris while both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mother s strong urge to recall and redress her ill fated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met harris and in doing so lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with both ann and her two daughters one married with children one a serial commitophobe struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists and perhaps more importantly if true love can endure the test of time are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome the subtle fact that the aged ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters the cinematography for evening is interesting most of the film is spent in ann s mind as she recalls the past and for that reason i think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed to give everyone an ethereal glow and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real but occurred in the past claire danes is beautiful appearing to be really really tall though just in reality and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test you can t really talk trash about the cast which leads off with claire danes and doesn t let up from there vanessa redgrave patrick wilson meryl streep and glenn close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film i can t really say anything negative about this film at all though hugh dancy s struggle to have his character emerge from utter one dimensionality is in the end a total loss playing the spoiled lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doesn t offer much in the way of character exploration he had his orders and stuck to them in the end gentlemen your lady friend will most certainly weep and while you ll likely not feel nearly as affected the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching evening catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of die hard or the upcoming rambo flick it ll be your little secret that this viewing didn t really cost you much at all 
since starting to read the book this movie is based on i m having mixed feelings about the filmed result i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film this would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i ve ever seen it would probably not have mattered i m trying to figure out what the cause is and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham much as i respect him for the hours which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan minton s book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it it s not that i dislike the movie i actually love the movie which is why since i started reading the novel i m feeling disturbed about the whole thing i feel disloyal to ms minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work reading it i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it unlike what one reviewer of the movie said it s not so much that some novels don t deserve to be a movie it s more like some books just can t make the transition ms minton s novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be i feel not filmable i think that ms minton s work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its value i cannot yet report that evening the film does not represent evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since i m only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point i guess i m writing this because i feel that if you re going to adapt a novel adapt it but don t make it something else that it s not i m not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else s work we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs dalloway and we would not have evening in its distressed form if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place but it s too much to say that it would be better if ms minton had left well enough alone because evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are 
saw this saturday night at the provincetown film festival and it s a stick to your bones movie it s really stayed with me adapted very smartly from what is probably an excellent novel it s a back and forth in time drama with fully rounded characters thoughtful rumination on life choices and i m not exaggerating one of the greatest casts ever assembled in years of movie making wonderful work from everyone led by a luminous vanessa redgrave as a dying deluded newport matron and claire danes as her much younger self meryl streep s daughter mamie gummer is like mama the real deal patrick wilson looks like paul newman circa and doesn t overplay the charm and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as barry bostwick and eileen atkins contributing sharp detailed cameos hugh dancy also from the stage doesn t bring much edge to the somewhat clich d role of an unhappy rich wastrel and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow but it s a deliberately paced visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues and you can cry at it and not feel like you re being recklessly manipulated also what a sumptuous parade of s s automobiles 
the first side story in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyes the story does contain some gundam staples its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor christina mckenzie who is secretly a federation pilot and a newbie zeon pilot named bernie wiseman alfred develops a sort of brotherly love for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christina war in the pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here this short episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war the unlikely friendship and bonding between bernie and christina each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some mandatory mobile suit battles in a gundam series normally watching anime in japanese or english i would leave up to personal preference but in this case i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one not only do the characters whom all except alfred are caucasian sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramas in short this show does not try to impress the audience what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given 
this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations there are constant references to assembly line production where workers are treated as cogs in a machine overseen by managers wielding clipboards controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed and firing workers stanley who meet all criteria as his supervisor says are always on time are hard workers do good work but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake this system destroys families stanley has to send his father to a nursing home where he quickly dies after stanley loses his job iris daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant references are made to the fact that now with declining wages both partners need to work the implication being that there s nobody left at home to care for the kids iris husband is dead from an illness and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care iris brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and or teeth job even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail presumably he s also black and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates she remarks that he like her is doing time her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave stanley however still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father s traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract as iris brother in law does suggesting that he married the wrong sister he does not as iris says conform to the work eat sleep routine of everyone else rather he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way in a sort of bauhaus ideal this was the dream of early modernists and s socialists such as the bauhaus to use technology to provide for all basic needs allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations he is also outside of traditional gender relations he cooks he cleans he cares for his family and he knows how to iron iris on the other hand lives in a traditionally male role she s a factory worker the mains source of income for her extended family and she brings stanley into the public realm traditionally off limits to women by teaching him to read and write she gives him access to the world of knowledge also traditionally gendered male literacy here is used as a metaphor for the traditionally masculine public realm and the systems of circulation monetary vehicular cultural that enable participation in the public realm without this access stanley is feminized the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning he is excluded from all regular circulations unable to participate in the monetary can t open a bank account in the vehicular can t get a driver s license can t ride the bus and in the social he asks if he exists if he can t write his name after learning to read he grabs books on auto repair farming and spirituality the bible the word of god is therefore relativized placed on the same value plane as how to books in fact organized religion in general is only very occasionally present the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex it is however acknowledged as a moral force iris clearly a character devoted to living a good life mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching once able to read he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan a car and a house taking his place at the head of the family the breadwinner presumably he s an industrial designer dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce this ending probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it wasn t forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line now that according to the pundits we ve comfortably moved on to post industrial capitalism the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period nevertheless it s highly recommended at least if you want to exercise your brain disregard the ending and it s close to a perfect 
i saw this film when it was originally released in i enjoyed it then and i still do now but what i realize now is that this is quite adult for a film with a g rating especially the notion of dying and going to heaven burt reynolds and dom deluise work wonderfully together and reynolds singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog there are some good songs ranging from upbeat let s make music together to downright emotional home to my heart i found the plot good although it does go off on a tangent once or twice the final scene of the film with charlie and anne marie is one of the saddest i ve ever seen in animation a film worth experiencing 
i just saw this film i first saw it when i was and could just about remember the end so i watched it like minutes ago and i may seem like a baby as i am ha ha i started to cry at the ending i forgotten how sad it was i think i was mainly sad for anne marie because she said i love you charlie and also i ll miss you charlie just made me really cry ha ha it has to be one of me favourite movies of all time it is just a film well worth watching watch it ha ha thats all i can say xd but i love this film its a true classic xx maverick xx 
i wish kids movies were still made this way dark and deep there was get this character development and charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character plot development superb animation emotional involvement and a rational relatable and consistent theme if not for the handful of song and dance routines you would never have thought this was a kids movie and this is why i give it such a high rating this movie is an excellent film let alone for a kids movie which brings me to my second point this has got to be the darkest kids movie i ve seen in quite some time this coming from a year old i d be shocked to see any child under the age of not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across ala jurassic bark for those of you who are futurama fans and this is what makes this movie so good just because the movie universally evokes emotions we don t normally like to feel and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad in fact it means it succeeded good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh good horror movies are supposed to make us scared good sad movies are supposed to make us sad my point is good movies are supposed to move you not simply entertain this movie moved me also this movie is incredibly violent by today s standards for a kids movie and contains subject matter that by today s standards may not be suitable for some children parents i d say watch it first i m not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing but i just saw this yesterday and it came as a surprise even to me 
this is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever i had forgotten about the movie for about years until i saw an add on tv for adgth and it brought back fond memories of me watching it when i was a little kid and when i watched it a few nights ago i became addicted to the movie usually i don t like animated family movies but this one is special it is the perfect family movie the ending of the movie always touches my heart and saddens me very much but that is what makes this movie amazing better than all of the garbage that is coming out for kid movies today i mean the movie is g rated and it is about dogs who are involved with gambling there is a lot of smoking drinking murder death and hell depicted in the movie which i believe makes the movie from good to great i mean movies today don t bring reality to kids and in this movie they did rip judith barsi dom deluise
all dogs go to heaven is in my opinion the best animated film ever made i m not really a big fan of animated films but there s something about this one that makes it better than any other animated film i ve seen the music is wonderful as is the performances of burt reynolds dom deluise and especially ken page as the king gator let s make music together is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any movie musical i ve seen this is definitely a must see for people of all ages 
lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids that depends on the kid this isn t a movie for a year old it s more geared toward the years and older crowd i saw this movie when i was i absolutely loved it at the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes this movie deals with more serious issues and therefore has a little more emotional impact in this movie characters can die and be sent to hell this gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives the good guys aren t always perfectly sweet and nice like other cartoons they have real motivations like revenge and greed but also compassion and friendship shows that things aren t always black and white excellent movie
