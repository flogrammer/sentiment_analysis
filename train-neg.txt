story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of it s singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level it s better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly 
the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than years to make a swedish film the first being susan sontag s brother carl which was made in sweden with swedish actors no less the results oscar wilde said it best in reference to dickens the old curiosity shop one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell pretty much the same thing here interiors is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers i m afraid of my anger looking into the middle distance i don t like who i m becoming the directorial quotations to use a polite term from bergman are close to parody the incredibly self involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are to the point of strangulation i read a poem of yours the other day it was in i don t know the new yorker oh that was an old poem i reworked it far from not caring about these people however i found them quite hilarious much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen s earlier films only he s directed his actors to play the lines straight having not cast himself in the movie he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics intonations and neurotic habits turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like kenneth branagh in celebrity the basic plot dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother seems to be lifted more or less from bergman s winter light the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst it all comes through in the shopworn visual aural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach etc etc allen s later serious films are less embarrassing but also far less entertaining i ll take interiors woody s rarely made a funnier movie 
i don t know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars angie charlie denise rosanna and jon that there wasn t enough left to really make a movie this could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a year old woman and not angie harmon why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasn t a five year old what a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well 
this film is mediocre at best angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti comedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise s marriage hopefully that effort produces better results 
this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men s wives i thought the walker would be thrilling and engaging but i was so wrong the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow that even after minutes of the film nothing happens much seriously the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes that s how slow it is the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom it s almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class it s sad that the walker becomes such a boring mess despite such a strong cast blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing 
i saw this movie at a drive in in until howard the duck i considered this the worst movie i had ever seen this movie tried to combine all the genera in one comedy horror teenage angst and the hot rod that must have sired my mother the car maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it s time 
ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical s teens in turmoil movie it is not a horror or science fiction movie plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their hot rod club because they cannot meet the rent once kicked out they decide to try an old haunted house the only saving grace for the film is that the ghost paul blaisdell in the she creature suit turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell 
 ghost of dragstrip hollow was one of the many s movies about hot rodding teens encountering the supernatural in this case the teens can t pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted with nowhere else to go they decide on an apparently haunted house as you may have guessed once they arrive some weird things start happening and there s a twist at the end there s nothing in this movie that you haven t seen in other movies but it s nice entertainment nonetheless my favorite character was the foul mouthed parrot well let me rephrase that he didn t talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie but he said things that we don t expect out of a bird the movie s pure hokum but harmless 
 ghost of dragstrip hollow appears to take place in a spotless netherworld an era long gone by where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket it opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival who pressures her into a car race that s about it for the drag racing this b flick is mostly concerned with rock n roll man the folks at american international were obviously fond of decent square teens who liked to party and yet didn t mind an adult chaperone there are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges necking kid we thought we d come out for some fresh air dad where did you think you d find it down her throat but the ghost is a little late in arriving brief at minutes the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off screen and a pre scooby doo styled unmasking which makes no sense however for nostalgia buffs some mindless fun from 
the characters are unlikeable and the script is awful it s a waste of the talents of deneuve and auteuil 
the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya there is no story no humor no nothing the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs up advertisements stitched together heavily influenced from the matrix and kung fu hustle but very poorly executed i did not go a lot of expectations but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder what were these guys thinking the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikini the reason why i did not give a rating of is that every time i think i have seen the worst bollywood proves me wrong 
summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what s the hottest movie of the week given of the screens dedicated to screening it ok so i may exaggerate on the percentage but you get my drift besides stuff from hollywood bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters and from some of the trailers shown i m hyped to watch them too tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas when i watched jodha akbar it was a full house but it wasn t for tashan after watching it i knew why it was entertaining but it was fundamentally weak just like it s literal english title which means style tashan is all style but little substance not that it doesn t have the usual star power but scenes felt forced and some bordered on a tad ridiculous even for bollywood standards i must say which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya who wrote dhoom and dhoom both of which i enjoyed tremendously in his rookie directorial outing with tashan while you can t fault his direction you d probably scratch your head over the plot which was clunky at best it tried to force too many things into the story though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation but that came a little too late and only toward the finale which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie with hong kong s wirework and hollywood s ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink you have an assortment of vehicles appearing and the one that took the cake in a dhoom homage was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere at best tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff a call center executive who gives english tuition only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh kareena kapoor who s not exactly who she seems the meek and sweet natured hottie she engages jimmy s services for her boss mobster bhaiyyaji anil kapoor who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah beng does it and to complete the quartet akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji s business so begins a road trip of sorts with friends who turned enemies and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all because he goes from zero to hero executing moves that would shame rambo in absolutely no time which is quite out of character kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee every character has a backstory created and i thought akshay kumar s bachchan pandey was probably the best the most touching and the most fun of the lot even though his character seemed a lot like a non green incredible hulk with his gravity defying leaps and power packing punches his wounds also heal automatically which impressively puts wolverine to shame and the best part is his theme song which is damn alpha male and played in ra ra mode each time he takes on adversaries but sad to say that s the only tune that is memorable something that cheers bachchan pandey bachchan pandey for most bollywood movies i watch i will usually be able to despite the obvious language gaps emerge from screenings humming a tune or two i wasn t able to do that after tashan because the songs unfortunately just weren t catchy at all usually the song dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location that i enjoy versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain or atop jagged rocks on the beach front tashan probably didn t take itself too seriously but coming from vijay krishna acharya s story you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous and for continuity to be a little more careful as well billed as a blockbuster now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one despite akshay kumr stealing the show tashan could have been better on the whole 
shame on yash raj films and aditya chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth you tube standards i was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene i just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can throw away crores on such stupidity shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to saif ali khan completely disappointed in your choice of film kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and akshay comes up as the dim wit anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for english his cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last minutes it was enough to pop a blood vessel don t waste any brain cells energy or your money to go see this go see rent amu with konkana sensharma instead a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of india intelligent poignant and a wonderful story tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in indian cinema making 
if this is a product from one of the biggest production houses of indian film industry yash raj then i am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards if you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of anil akshay saif and kareena then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film the film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and akshay kumar he has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations the first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film that itself was a clear indicator of the director s vision every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted anil kapoor s gimmick of attempting good english falls flat most of the times and saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie in short it s the biggest waste of resourses after jhoom barabar jhoom i would say that even aaja nachle was a better enjoyable movie than this one cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved the most unwanted was the flashback sequence of akshay s love story after the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music vishal shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song the songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically only one song falak tak chal is somehow good of all in the lot an opportunity wasted by vishal shekhar regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this akshay and saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign location probably ladakh in the next scene they are searching for kareena in haridwar and then back in the hills with kareena in the dicky of their car i am still thinking who wrote this if you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts you can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are god are we still seeing a movie with all these technical heights achieved so no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan dear anil kapoor akshay kumar if possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out as artists of such stature you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers people still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively i think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie the actors and the production house both 
the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman it is hilarious except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film the story looks like the writer told his yr old son to write the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero 
i just saw the movie in theater the movie has very few good points to talk about kareena s beauty and a couple of songs may be thats it the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed even mumbai indians too just now chennai has made it to semi final but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar this is height of stupidity audience is not paying to watch such stupidity i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies they cant make it the last good action i have seen was from ghatak and khiladiyon ka khialdi the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me does these people see their movie after completion can t they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it i just want to go back to amitabh s era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes the sound effect was not very effective in those days but visually it is much better than current era scenes this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors please don t make any more action movies until you acquire the art of making it realistic 
if there is one film which is the worst of this year it s tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom style film and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock it was even worst then dhoom and what i expected first saif s introduction which is boring then saif kareena meet kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god what he is doing in such a weird film what kinda role it is what acting is he doing his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke vijay krishna acharya would have got films more to direct if this film had worked thats the strategy of yashraj only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music vishal shekhar is ordinary performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay
i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest saif has over acted kareena has improved her figure but is not a good actress anyway akshay is good anil is also good may i say the role wasn t good great deal of cheapness is filled in wondered if that was supposed to be the comedy part of the movie just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish it has a history of so many good films overall i was totally disappointed with the movie 
ok i am not japanese i do know a little about japanese culture and a little less about japanese pop culture other than that i am spanish i eat paella and i like black humor good with that point set i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences mamoru oshii is quite a good director despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head and even that was curious and somehow interesting and i am surprised he came up with this it may just be one of those lost in translation cases i am afraid it is but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible the jokes seemed bad the script was overcooked i mean give the audience a break and shut up a little you damn narrator to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast paced speaking and absurd action however i thought the animation was really cool the idea is great and it is well exploited in those animated scenes however the eye candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo jumbo speech over still pictures it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut out hysterical characters scene i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this the idea was good but horribly exploited maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie or maybe it will be more and more over narrated scenes but hell if you thought talking head was dense amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke of course all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european probably this is totally useless to japanese people maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation maybe 
 for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all c p must now be compared first off the beginning did have elements of style and if handled well could have become a cult classic a la pulp fiction or a desi desperado but the plot was there one begins to meander and at one point completely loses it throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english a call center smart alec a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb a levitating gravity defying hit man and a cop with a hundred or was it a thousand black cat commandos on their trail good ingredients in competent hands but this is where i would like to ask the director sir what were you smoking im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making for what must never be done insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music watch the videos hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed vishal shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy as i sign off i want to really badly know how does akshay s bullet wound vanish in a microsecond what were you editors doing tashan maybe 
the sight of kareena kapoor in a two piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan the mega disappointing mind numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend bad films are bad films and we see some every week but tashan is not just a bad film it s a terrible film terrible because it takes its audience for granted terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they ve got big movie stars onboard written and directed by vijay krishna acharya tashan is what you d describe as a road movie but one that s going in all the wrong directions saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff a call centre executive who s hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji that s anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster desperate to go cool jimmy s got his eye on pooja the gangster s pretty young assistant played by kareena kapoor who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of crore rupees determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey the gangster s faithful aide from kanpur who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that s hidden across the length and breadth of the country much like those bad eighties potboilers tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot but the treatment s so over the top so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three act structure you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed that garish item song in the desert the bullet dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort kareeena s bikini moment even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala and believe it or not even a dhanno style horse driven tonga in all fairness not all these set pieces are badly done the item song in the desert is quite neat actually but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture because you re just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really little do you expect in a seemingly fast paced road movie to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making what s more i don t think they cared either the film reeks of arrogance arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work tashan is like an overcooked stew there are films that kill you softly and then there s tashan a film that kills you with excess packaged snazzily with glossy finish camera work exotic locations and fancy costumes every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn t hold borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesn t help either because they don t blend with the film s wafer thin plot one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging but anil kapoor s grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly unable to find his feet kareena kapoor meanwhile queen of over the top delivery does a decent job but of course if tashan is salvaged to some extent it s thanks to akshay kumar s irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character you cringe when he s cupping his crotch repeatedly and you scowl when he delivers those double meaning dialogues but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he s up there despite some good music from vishal shekhar the songs seem like they re only prolonging your misery well that s because tashan is a test of your patience in case you didn t know tashan means style i m sorry to say this film has none 
such a long awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedy a bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors they ve done their part of the movie very well good acting but i don t think that can save the movie india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could make out head tail of the stunts they ve used akki akshay kumar very well but could ve been done much much better animation is the worst i ve seen in recent movies s movies had better animation scenes i guess initial scene where the car is falling off flying should be better word the road into lake and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every to mins just to make sure audiences don t forget the movie name i guess 
this is the biggest flop of i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster the songs have been added without situations the story have been stretched to fill the hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it s like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with people only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish akki is also done a good job but the movieee just forget it 
i wasn t terribly impressed with dante s st season offering in homecoming it wasn t much of a horror story but rather a smart political statement with the undead screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men s sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak but is unclear because this is never revisited the episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah it seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end the worst episode well except for chocolate 
i love the frequently misnomered masters of horror series horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment projects like this and the similar greenlight project with gave us feast like it or lump it are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horror this one began with a kernel of really kool idea and ran right off the edge of where in the world am i going with this i don t know how to spoil the spoiled but spoiler ahead all of a sudden no there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier we have long haired luminescent aliens huh huh brain drilling males and yeah i get it but well the worst curse of storytelling a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouement cue to storytellers your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up not the other way around storytelling math end of spoilers big oops 
a huge disappointment from writer hamm and director dante their previous collaboration on the first season s homecoming was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways this poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered the supposed payoff showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing if the point of the story was an extraterrestrial cleaning of the planet of it s human infestation why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la stephen king s the stand instead of having the male population butcher the females i kept hoping the episode would improve as i kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous the religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear sam hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it i like a lot of both dante and hamm s work but this was just unwatchable 
i gave this stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned from the domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos therein outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction it s bleak depressing and hopeless while i don t mind a less than cheery ending i m really very tired of the humans suck clich that s central to every movie i know you can t get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self hatred as a member of the human race but how s bout as a writer director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil right now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die just go out find a lake and swim til your arms are tired this way you won t be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive it s silly not thoughtful and boring 
i m not alone in admiring the first superman movie a film that richard donner executed masterfully i am also not alone in scorning richard lester s superman which brings us to the richard donner cut of the same movie sadly it is still an absolute abomination superman s world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses but superman stretches things too far it doesn t matter who directed superman because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader in a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do unlike the original superman with or without his powers superman s strength or lack thereof is handled in the least believable manner there is too much to criticize so i will not bother i condemn this movie perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on super duper bad 
so we get so see added footage of brando interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff susannah york was hardly a slouch new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn t notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that let s listen to donner make fun of lester s version that made more logical sense the president talks of the zod defacing the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd superman s freedom of the press line sounded silly compared to care to step outside which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark s earlier scene in the truck stop then there is the ending with the turn back the world to go back in time effect it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack n j ever went since it doesn t free zod and company any more 
i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was was the viewer supposed to learn something or reflect on anything here what was up with the pumpkins was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished i am truly amazed i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community 
when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don t care what the movie is edison started really good with some good effort from the singers who want to be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience done a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action done and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie when you see elite police officers packed with weapons that can demolish a building shoot at a guy behind a car fail to hit him even once while he kills all but and then the guy takes out a flame thrower to kill the rest you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this 
 the curse of frankenstein sticks faithfully to mary shelley s story for one word of the title which wouldn t be so bad if the changes were any good at all the tragedy of the creature destroying frankenstein s family has been completely excised and replaced with nothing the heart and moral centre of the story is gone it doesn t help that this frankenstein is a conniving devious murderer he deserves everything he gets the plot is basically a shallow checklist of frankenstein clich s even taken on its own terms this is rubbish a bland rambling film featuring a shite looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut as it s the first of hammer s horror films directed by terence fisher and starring peter cushing and christopher lee its place in horror history is secure but it s crap 
nintendo you ers how could you do this to me i can t believe it this movie is actually worse than the first one i went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along oh god where do i even begin the plot sucked the voice acting sucked the animation sucked the ending really sucked if you liked this movie you suck too and to futuramafan who said this was the greatest movie ever you are a tool plain and simple this isn t a movie for anyone but crack addled ten year olds with game boys who think pikachu is god i m still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie and then there was pikachu s adventure don t even get me started on that horrible mess of a film it is in all truth one of the most boring experiences of my entire life don t go watch this at any costs bottom line go out find every copy of this movie that you can and burn it burn them all and then proceed to rent a good movie like aliens or bowling for columbine or even back to the future 
pokemon the movie was a terrible film unlike the first one this is not a good film at all the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad tracey really doesn t have much to say or do and unlike brock offers no comic relief the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining overall this film isn t worth renting and the short movie before didn t do anything for me or my wife and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans oh well maybe the next one will be better cant ge t much worse
i recently watched this again and there s another version which is shorter i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the difference one is japanese and no pikachu short is all i can come up with ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice prof ivy was rather boring she sounded as if she was almost asleep no expression at all with the few lines she had this was enjoyable enough but there wasn t much to it at all a collector whos after lugia he has no plan to destroy the world and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture lugia causes a lot of destruction the pokemon movies that follow are slightly better deoxys poke is great with no almost here 
ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names i mean great actors like the freeman aka morgan freeman an asset to hollywood however completely wasted in this film then we got kevin spacey who i ve been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven t hit him yet well the reason for that i might add is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first minutes of it the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone they got the one liners and sound bite worthy stuff the token troubled black guy ll cool j who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience oh and lots of gun fire i mean a whole lot spoiler not the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who s crooked dead and the hero prevails they got flame throwers and rocket launchers really no kidding bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors or a great fan of justin timberlake to all the year old girls out there enjoy i wish i had more hands because then i would have more thumbs because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening may g d have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies well it could be worst another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher hehe check out in the mix lol or even get rich or die trying now the special thing about that movie is that its got year old men playing or even younger teens i could go on with these 
roy rogers stars as jesse james and his look alike gambler man clint burns george gabby hayes is mr rogers s ex pal sheriff gabby gale storm jane fillmore and sally payne polly morgan are a noteworthy team as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero of course mistaken identity impersonation is a plot development since rogers essays a dual role rogers is charming as usual but there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary any potential to deliver a memorable jekyll hyde performance is done in by poor material the better pair to watch are ms storm and ms paye as the st louis journal reporters they are the film s highlight the songs are fine though badly synched jesse james at bay joseph kane roy rogers george gabby hayes gale storm
unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie my points film is based on things ethnical point of view as it happens on most of the american films the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning or things about the asian culture but unfortunately it is not enough knowing kunefe and names of other foods doesn t make a person understand a culture for example shaving is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that lebanese people are christian ok they got that and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other arabic countries the main difference between eastern and western culture is we don t make ethnocentrism so we don t judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film sexual revolution of a girl there is nothing much to say about this show me girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre please watch dr strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it where is the truth where is the meaning about the movie 
hollywood s misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits for every godfather ii there are dozens of more american graffiti s stayin alives and grease s while the original grease is not a great film the adaptation of the long running broadway hit does have songs evocative of the s energetic choreography and an appealing cast when paramount began work on a follow up the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster fortunately for moviegoers michelle pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts her talent and beauty were already evident herein and pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform maxwell caulfield however lacks even the skill to express embarrassment and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic what romantic interest beyond hormones could the cool sassy pfeiffer have in the deadpan caulfield that dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory only cameos by veterans such as eve arden connie stevens and sid caesar have any wit although lorna luft does rise slightly above the lame material reviewers have complained that because grease is always compared to the original the movie comes up lacking however even taken on its own terms the film is a clunker after a frenetic opening number which evidently exhausted the entire cast the energy dissipates with few exceptions the original songs bear little resemblance to the early s and the only nostalgia evoked is for our miss brooks and sid caesar s comedy hour the jokes fall flat and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer patricia birch is clumsy to be polite however worse films have been inflicted on audiences and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters unfortunately grease is not even unintentionally funny instead the film holds the viewer s attention like a bad train wreck just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered the next scene plunges into even worse carnage 
the first part of grease with john travolta and olivia newton john is one of the best movie for teens this one is a very bad copy the change is only in the sex in the first one the good one was sandy here it s michael i prefer to watch the first grease 
the tenuous connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when didi conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young maxwell caulfield who is a british exchange student although in the previous film olivia newton st john s foreign speech pattern is not explained it s explained here caulfield is her cousin what s conn still doing in school i guess she just likes hanging around rydell high even though now she s a beautician caulfield s a smart kid so of course the hood types led by adrian zmed have him labeled as a nerd and that s especially bad when zmed s girl friend decides she likes caulfield but being a nerd just isn t going to cut it that s when caulfield decides to put on a modern day zorro act he gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face if getting michelle pheiffer is not in the cards caulfield won t have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he s outfitted grease introduced michelle pheiffer and maxwell caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed if you saw the first grease film a much better film than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out in addition to conn eve arden sid caesar and dody goodman all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles the music score isn t remotely as good as the songs that come from the original it s not that grease is bad it s just not all that great 
when i was grease was like crack it was a classless shameful euphoric and powerfully addictive experience my sister and i would watch it rewind it and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another so if you are an year old girl and you reviewed this film as brilliant or fun or better than the original grease you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass if however you are not a little girl you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease was anything but an inane artless slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production distribution and or consumption for the sake of criticism i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows in a well executed musical the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters in grease with a few debatable exceptions to the music is obscenely pointless most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way score tonight reproduction do it for our country and prowlin without making one concrete statement about any of the film s characters or themes plus all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance the t birds should be badass and if not at least somewhat likable but instead each of them is an annoying wussy dufus loser in the end when johnny nogerelli offers michael the sacred t bird jacket and initiates him into the gang michael should kick it to the ground spit on it and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it but of course he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads there is no greater honor than to be one with the t birds since michael is beautiful smart kind resourceful and above average in everyway his musical impotence notwithstanding it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask stephanie on the other hand is a slovenly slack jawed bubble gum smacking dirty sweatshirt wearing gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat so aside from being pretty i guess she harbors no likable characteristics thus audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael s attraction to her i could go on and on but i didn t want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair i will say this though to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time s sake grease is an experience akin to re living your first kiss only you are now and kissing a snot nosed year old kid with acne and slobby braces the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed trust me 
this is probably the first entry in the lance o leary nurse keat detective series in subsequent o leary films he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee a group of relatives all played by well known character actors gathers in an old house on a rainy nite of course to speak to a wealthy relative who goes into a coma while they wait for him to recover all sorts of mysterious goings on happen including a couple of murders a creepy film worth seeing 
i am an actor producer director and what i am about to say are facts this project was the worst film in movie making history from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke why would blockbuster released such crap i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession was the director trying to make a bad movie i don t think so i seen bad zombie movies but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table this movie sucks i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself but please consider in taking up a different profession i respect the fact that you completed a movie but i have to ask you were you smoking crack i mean the makeup on your girls the scary zombies what were you thinking to the whole nation if i could have voted zero i would have worst film in movie making history 
the plot of edison was decent but one actor in particular ruined the entire film justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire f r a t squad whether it was an emotional scene an action scene or even a silent scene justin timberlake managed to ruin it do not waste your time watching this film don t even bother downloading it midget porn would be a much better choice and justin if you re reading this stick to music even though you re no good at that you ve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing 
this movie is a joke i mean a ha ha funny joke why because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh i got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical inane plot and horrible acting wow within this movie there are so many unanswered questions for example why do these women become zombies and how why are there four black women who are zombie s caretakers and what is their purpose since when does people make up a nation of zombies and is smeared black eye mascara scary to anyone anywhere even a year old and lastly why was this movie made at all why why why no answer that s what i thought on the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie we apologize for this movie in advance lol at least they had the decency to do this much 
i cannot believe that this movie was ever created i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation the best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished again to reiterate other user comments the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all it is never explained 
i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie it was so bad i was totally fooled by the box art don t be fooled its not worth your time i promise you i don t know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what i am so disappointed the description on the back of the box doesn t even match the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper the synopsis on the back says she is only did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be if anyone actually liked this flick then i ve lost all faith in humanity and don t even get me started on the story compared to the title or the fact that the entire movie was done all in locations or that the cops didn t even have close to real uniforms why would i even say that who cares about the cops uniforms compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans 
usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant i tend to support everybody because their efforts are worth but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits imagine the following situation think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far think about some great attractive art for that movie s dvd box and a promising plot voil you got zombie nation see it only if you really don t have anything else better to do anything is better 
zombie nation r hey i was bored i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch zombie nation hey i love zombie movies says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description funny how it doesn t warn me not to watch this film i could ve used that advice zombie nation is just like troll in that it s completely misnamed it has little if anything depending on your point of view to do with zombies and takes place all within one city this film revolves around a crooked cop who acts as badly as possible he has to be trying to suck this much while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them yup he s a serial killer cop not only is this film flawed in thinking that it s a zombie flick it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong serial killers enjoy killing they live for it and they get down and personal with it this guy knocks out the women and injects them with some poison he doesn t even have sex with the corpse or dismember it talk about boring eventually one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy they were all buried or tossed into the ocean but you wouldn t know it buy the sharp clean clothes they re all wearing the women then act very poorly and take their revenge oh yay this film was crap in every category crap acting crap writing crappier sets and crappier make up effects the women don t look zombie like unless you count really dark make up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie they can all talk behave think and act perfectly human the gore is weak compared to even many pg films and the nudity is beyond brief you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence then the exact same breasts later go figure guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they re obviously filming in you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set up and even unless you are blind you can see the director failing steer clear it s a waste of time 
yeah i m sure it really could be a nation if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times man i am really glad that i saw this movie on fear net instead of renting it i m a big fan of the george romero movies and i m pretty sure that if he saw this movie he d probably throw up while laughing too hard i mean what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlie s devils it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop police station apartment flat whatever room it was with the gong in the background and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop i couldn t even tell what nationality the killer was and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn t help either oh well what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world so for all of those who worship mystery science theater or if you just like reaming on bad c movies c for craptastic then this is the movie for you or not 
horrible acting bad story line cheesy makeup and this is just the tip of the iceberg i have never seen a worse movie in my life minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen it didn t aside from a nice breast shot the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse and the same warehouse was used for at least of the sets you even see this same red chair in several different locations if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment not some warehouse which will echo all your actor s dialog note to producers renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee you will be demanding your money back i only spent to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off 
i honestly want the last minuets of my life back the only person that is fit to watch this movie is helen keller i kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there eyes they talked like regular people one drove a car some voodoo woman asked what one of the zombies wanted and the zombie said i want to dance that was it out came the movie i couldn t take it any longer can i sue for a hour of my life 
wow i went to the video store tonight because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie and i found this gem i looked at the cover and i thought it looked like just the movie for my mood i brought it home and put it on this movie was not the b horror movie that i had in mind this was much worse i wanted a bad movie but what i got i didn t know that crap like this existed amongst man this movie seemed like a year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it i am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies he needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs if you are thinking about renting this or buying it i will tell you the same thing that i would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide don t do it it s not worth it i really have nothing nice to say about this movie don t do it 
acclaimed director mervyn leroy puts drama on film that competes with the best of soap operas high drama is found in the loves and infidelities in new york s social set oh yes don t forget jealousy can bring about tainted hearts and murder the all star cast features barbara stanwyck van heflin james mason ava gardner cyd charisse and nancy davis 
the animation in this re imagining of peter the wolf is excellent but at minutes the film is sleep inducing they should have called it peter the snails because everything moves at a snail s pace i couldn t even watch the film in one sitting i had to watch it minutes at a time and it was pure torture save yourself minutes do not watch this film and you will thank me i can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees unfortunately to vote for the winner in the best animated short short category the voters will have to sit through the whole thing i already feel sorry for them and must predict that there s no way this film will come close to winning 
this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence however after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence however out of no where when they are on a luxury cruise the ship sinks and they lose everything and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life what an odd silly and preachy film personally i d like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting 
i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together the talk is not of the master s great films like north by northwest or strangers on a train but a lesser known effort like this one from obscure and seriously flawed which showcases the great director in fledgling form emily and fred hill joan barry and harry kendall are a middle class london couple scrimping to stay ahead he begrudges their lot she accepts it change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury they make plans for a world cruise but their problems have only begun just ask richard hannay roger o thornhill or marion crane well marion s indisposed at the moment but you get the idea travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight setting one up for a perilous journey at best this is perhaps hitchcock s earliest foray into this theme and not his most successful or memorable hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element in this case domestic drama rather than suspense but the two do not cohere at least not here the hills are a dull flat couple with no chemistry or personality when they find themselves at the folies berg re in the form of cross cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers the curtain s gone up too soon gasps emily they aren t dressed when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing even if the people they partner off with are drips too emily s man gordon percy marmont carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs which he suggests be filled by emily fred s girl the princess betty amann has clara bow s eyes and wallace beery s five o clock shadow there s also an obnoxious fellow passenger a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue subtlety was still to come everything is shot in an abrupt manner with confusing blocking and strained dialogue hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn t come off and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears when fred and emily break off they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged together rickshaws one of many clunky attempts at symbolism emily s the only vaguely sympathetic character in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon but mostly because she s among the first of hitchcock s many magnetic blondes her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film s conclusion matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set piece for the protagonists to come to grips with and presumably repair their relationship only they aren t active participants in the resolution and except for the fate of a friendly cat nothing about the ending resonates at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early s and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food rich and strange is hitchcock paying his dues and learning his trade one for scholars but not casual film goers 
there is no suspense in this serial when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day no in fact the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode this show is so boring that i can t see how it ever got made let alone released on dvd obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films but even the script is awful an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that i am not quite sure because it is too awful to follow watch the s version or the s versions or even batman begins just anything over this version 
he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero s acting and the hole thing was i can t believe that steven segal s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making th rate films with th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn t show up at all i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a million dollar budget segal being paid of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concur it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie 
i can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is i was sold on the promise of action with segal and stealth aircraft which normally make for an entertaining action movie i can honestly say i d rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again the acting was so awful that it was almost funny the story was insanely weak with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an f through them the script was so poor if i found out that a year old wrote it i shouldn t be in the least surprised the direction and production is so amateur i wouldn t even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video utter utter drivel those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art and they should be ashamed of themselves steven segal should never ever show his face in public again i can t imagine what made him agree to star in this the worst film i have seen in my entire life 
how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up with enough cops to run a mini war that include such weapons as flamethrowers you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying thanks to a corrupt cop you will never get your ish minutes back life is too precious to rent this movie i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie if you like justin timberlake feel free to rent this movie he does have a very major part in it so fans might enjoy seeing him however i believe most of his fans are young girls who may be turned off by the violence in this movie 
i own almost every seagal movie yes even ones like this that are low budget and i must say this may be the worst not only of his movies but of all movies ever made the only highlight of this film and only reason i gave it stars instead of is that a it is seagal and b seagal does have some sweet action sequences specifically in the store and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife next time give me minutes of seagal killing people and don t even bother with a story line because the storyline not only stunk but so did the acting the fact that f s and f s somehow changed into f s and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f also the stealth never had to refuel and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point last i checked afghanistan has no air force we usa control the skies also this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret also how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top please tell us why they jailed him since when are air force pilots great commandos unless they are owen wilson and since when are their drunks in arab countries considering muslims don t drink alcohol also on top of that since when do arabs listen to orders from females like the in charge the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store and the other people he killed with a knife as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere 
unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under minutes the plot even for a seagal film the plot is just stupid i mean its not just bad its barely coherent the acting unbelievably wooden literally seen better acting in porno s ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a lesbian love scene which is utterly cringe worthy special effects wouldn t look out of place in a s sword and sorcery flick unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures don t make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back 
i just watched this movie on starz let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved the acting writing directing special effects camera crew sound and lighting it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie apparently back in when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for million now a days those things cost about billion and they cant go invisible apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour there was a completely random lesbian scene which i didn t mind but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes oh yeah since its a steven segal movie its predictable as hell all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane 
nobody could like this movie for its merit but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their mst quality then this is for you it ranks up there with road house for its preposterous characters sets and story line the bad writing really cracked me up i want you to dust those guys off instead of dust those guys f s take off from the carrier but when they get into formation they re f s without a hint of anger or skepticism segal goes back to work for the general who only minutes before was overseeing a covert mind wipe on seagal segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards so naturally the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too the hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway the little stealth fighter can fly all the way from california to afganistan without refueling then segal flies it back to california the long way i e by way of europe even though there s a carrier giving him air support minutes away in the arabian sea the cic in the carrier consists of black pcs flat screen tvs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls what a hoot 
first of all f is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft secondly the f s and f s cannot change their appearances they are not transformers thirdly the f has only one m cannon not two last but not the least at the end of the film seagle selected sidewinder missile but somehow when he pulled the trigger the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick as i have the experience of seeing f s and f s being mysteriously transformed into f s this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me however there is still one question i have to ask how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f when students hand in really bad work teachers assign s now i think for the sake of properly marking this film imdb should seriously consider adding a option otherwise it is not fair for those who receive out of 
if you watched this movie you know why i said jesus jesus jesus hehehe every time they said jesus jesus jesus i laughed thinking jesus jesus jesus why did i rent this movie i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen wtf is timberlake dreaful acting i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him but i really prefer an actor not this android called timberlake and his girlfriend was shallow hollow and annoying as hell i was happy when they both were popped in the street the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all it would have been much enjoyable without him by the way the music was ok but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes low motion and things like that something misplaced for this cops movie i thought maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake 
this movie should have never been made what a shame of the budget please hire convincing actors and make a proper movie very thin plot and unconvincing lines almost hilarious and that is a shame for an action movie definitely not worth watching they keep replaying the same shots of an stealth airplane flying away you have seen it ones and that was not worth re running or times it is time for steven seagal to retire from movie making his movies are getting worser every time black dawn and submerged were already bad but this movie is even worse 
steven seagal mr personality himself this time is the united states greatest stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station if he is able to successfully infiltrate a northern afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called black sunday who have commandeered an air force stealth fighter thanks to an american traitor along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor jannick mark bazeley john sands seagal will fly into enemy territory receiving help from his arab lover jessica ciera payton and a freedom fighter rojar alki david once they are on ground jannick is kidnapped by black sunday leaders stone vincenzo nicoli and his female enforcer eliana katie jones and sands must figure out how to not only re take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter but rescue him as well and maybe sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained rather steve toussaint in the process sands has hours until a general s navy pilots bomb the entire area on board the stealth black sunday equipped a biochemical bomb hoping to detonate it on the united states seagal gets a chance to shoot afghans when he isn t slicing their throats with knives the film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead the setting of afghanistan doesn t hold up to scrutiny nor does how easily seagal and co are able to move about the area undetected so easily and the plot itself is nothing to write home about the movie is edited fast the camera a bit too jerky seagal isn t as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes unlike the good old days one of seagal s poorest efforts and he s as understated as ever not a compliment even more disappointing is the fact that seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film s chief villains tis a shame he doesn t even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around but it s not as clear a picture as i enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close ups 
as steven segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel his best was just fodder for bored teenagers this one tips the scales then falls off the characters are all cardboard the story is double lame i can t spoil it by telling you the ending you already know how all steven segal movies end if you have seen one here goes he is a super dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide instead of killing him to dope his brain until he don t remember squat he escapes of course gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in afghanastan by a rogue air force pilot who surprise surprise segal trained all the heroes except segal s character and his dusky girlfriend die heroically and steve baby save the whole world in one swell foop or fell swoop whatever made with some surplus air force and navy flying film and a lot of boom booms get some popeye cartoons instead 
i usually don t comment anything i read the others opinions but this this one i _have_ to comment i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action f and other hi tech stuff but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind lousy acting lousy script and a big science fiction it s one of the worst movies i have ever seen simply don t bother and one more thing before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site points and i give this movie a try now i m wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than points 
following the appalling attack force chances were that seagal could only have a step up with flight of fury to out stink attack force would take some doing flight of fury is a marked improvement overall but still in the grand scheme of thinks mediocre mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for seagal these days a sad insight into his movie career s decline where attack force was a hodge podge of plot lines altered drastically from conception to filming to post production flight of fury keeps the plot line more simple someone steals a high tech stealth fighter planning to use it to fire chemical weapons which we later bizarrely discover will destroy the whole world in hrs seagal has to get the plane back it s that simple no annoying sub plots and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works that s not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though it s pretty poor the introduction to side characters is badly done for example in filmic terms fof is bad it s badly acted by all involved and seagal looks bored to tears almost he s just got the look of a toddler who s been forced to perform the school nativity against his will and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness can we blame seagal though when the material is so un ambitious and cruddy not really this is the final film of his castel studio s multi picture deal the producers can t be bothered to make anything remotely good promising a or so million dollar budget and after seagal s obligatory million probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves if the film was made for the remaining million then i m elvis pressley so in that respect why should seagal put the effort into a film that s already got distribution sorted before it s made fan s though may argue he at least owes them the effort he s seriously looking jaded and the continued use of stand ins and dub overs is further indication of this michael keusch directs with some efficiency while the cinematography is quite good but in all technical areas and as usual with castel a bog standard stunt team there s nothing more than mediocrity and nothing to help the film rise above its material and bored leading man again there s a few action scenes focusing on characters other than seagal which in all truth we don t want to see overall the action isn t too bad it s nice and violent and on occasion we re treated to a few vintage nasty seagal beatings but overall nothing special partly due to a poor stunt crew and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting for me shadow man was a more enjoyable film because while ignoring the incoherent jumbled plot line there were more vintage seagal moments and more of him in centre stage he never disappeared for long periods during the film seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here and re appears after with little explanation there s far too much stock footage used using stock shots isn t an entirely horrendous thing but using it as a crutch is we re treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships all the time which get annoying plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place just check the backdrops chopping and changing the film is just middle of the road it says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless and gratuitous girl on girl scene with two hot chicks seagal even perks up briefly then too overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there but that s not saying much at all this will please many fans but they should bear in mind seagal himself would probably want to forget this one s existence 
i have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film one thing i see over and over is annoyance with megan the idealistic political scientist trying to change the world i loved her character maybe because i am a year old political science student and i think i m going to change the world too so i relate to megan besides she s cute she s no super model but more of a cute girl next door ok so she cried and screamed a lot it s very dramatic and seems overdone but doesn t it fit her character she goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick i think she made her argument very well of course being a young naive girl she is terrified of what she is about to face i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear furthermore i think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in as for the movie in general other than megan it was pretty much what i expected it had excellent gore scenes by micro budget standards the plot maybe took a quick thought hardly any contemplation it s basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film which the name implies i love the sadism of the doctor he kept ripping megan s shirt off not just for the cause of sleaze though largely so but also to torment her before he kills her the chainsaw hick was hilarious for slasher film lovers he was probably the best character i give this film out of it had a good setting almost no plot and a mix of good and terrible acting i would recommend it for a cheap thrill but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro budget horror 
slashers well if you like horrors its definitely one to see otherwise don t even bother it is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow trust me you wont need to look for them also try to ignore the cheesy actors if thats what you call them the basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being killers on the loose and whoever live s at the end gets rich now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days for example when i watched it i thought to my self i would nt mind having a go at this game especially for so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind 
more wide eyed hysterical s hyper cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti social pathological behaviour danza and grayson will leave you begging for mercy it s a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead or in nursing homes i kinda thought about suing them for torture as this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor defenseless ear drums i felt instant strong pain envelop my entire being that damn muscular vibrato can shatter soviet tanks into tiny bits nevermind glass why didn t you switch the channel if you didn t like it you might ask angrily fair point fair point the answer is that i wanted to but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor writhing in agony with my last ounces of energy i tried to reach the remote but couldn t a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven who then proceeds to pigmalionize him lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up this may seem like a rather thin plot but this noisy movie is so chock full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all this movie is relentless forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayer s reign in blood as in a south park episode whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange s musical world it s all infantile as if they were all year olds impersonating grown ups i can only envy people who find movies like this funny it must be great being easy to please what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious gut busting comedy but let s examine this phenomenon the s musical my best guess is that s musicals offered the more day dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven depending on whether you re church going or lenin s tomb going or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy inspired places ttono is more akin to a representation of hell but that s just me i don t seem to get musicals people talk there is a story but then all of a sudden everyone starts singing for about minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened when you think about it musicals are stranger than any science fiction film worse yet ttono my favourite type of pizza btw is not just a s musical but one with opera squealing opera is proof that there is such a thing as over training a voice to the point where it becomes an ear piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet i tried lowering the volume i lowered it from to then from to then i ended up lowering it to a which is usually so low that it s only heard by specially trained dogs and certain types of marsupials and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeys take the scene in the small boat in the river danza starts off with one of his deafening brain killing tunes and then nothing no animals anywhere to be seen even the crocodiles who are mostly deaf have all but left if you look carefully you might even see the trees change colour from green to yellow in a matter of minutes no this was not a continuity error it was plain old torture of the flora and those trees were just matte paintings imagine how real trees would have reacted the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency but because glass is only human hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self explosion i can listen to the loudest least friendly death metal band for hours but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache 
pathetic worse than a bad made for tv movie i can t believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick for some reason morgan freeman s character is constantly talking about and saying pussy when referring to nsync boy s girlfriend morgan freeman calling women pussy is just awkward what the hell were the people behind this film thinking too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting confusing camera angles a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable i rented this flop with low expectations but well it really sucked 
when thinking of the revelation that the main character in bubble comes to at films end i am reminded of last years machinist with christian bale the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters an understated yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life the title is cause for contemplation perhaps we the audience are the ones in the bubble as we are given no payoffs in the films slim minute running time audience reactions were often smug and judgmental clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w back in office for a second term it s sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role this film has it s merits and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn t say outright 
san francisco is a big city with great acting credits in this one the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city they didn t even manage the most basic of realistic details so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie you will not be thinking oh i ve been there you will be thinking how did a two story firetrap stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations it detracts but the acting was always competent the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles at least in the beginning the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting the plot is weak ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance they were framed and paced better but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries the white boy intro was pointless i think the filmmakers didn t know what to do with it so they left it loosely structured and cut it down the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal really folks everyone knows it s not groovy to live in the ghetto but his segments are the most humorous they threw away some good opportunities educated and embittered on the west coast a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable that would have been interesting this was not the hunter s point intro was the most disappointing it was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the most distant from san francisco you ve seen it done before and you ve seen it done better even the video game was better despite the generic non locality and aimless script these characters have potential the actors have talent and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction about ten minutes before the ending good concept placed in the wrong hands ps there is a missing minority here see if you can guess which one 
it s and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well fans will be upset and certainly the seats will be full only less happy there are so many black players on the field this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable it s not much more but it s really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance for the time probably most notably tom selleck unfortunately any goodness selleck brings to the screen is quickly trumped by actors like dick butkus it s a silly story about super bowl betting pj jackson is charged by new york read mafia for ensuring the game ends for their favor in this case a bet pj is innocent enough and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there but things seem to fall apart for him another person the unsuspected lainie takes charge for a while the mystery of murders isn t known for certain but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that lainie is the new antagonist it s a bad movie but is watchable the acting is decent and the filming is ok at least there weren t any silly typical s car chases they have their place just not here just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you ll survive maybe a 
the championship game is only a couple of days away but things in new orleans aren t as they should be from players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable wonderful time can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined despite what you might think when you first read about superdome this is not a football movie in fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought instead superdome is another of those lousy soap opera ish s made for tv movies populated with hollywood has beens and those that never will be the cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good the best or worst example is van johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he s there the plot is dull uninteresting and unbelievable donna mills as a hit man yeah right it s about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked david jansen the movie also lacks any pace trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow superdome might have had with no drama or suspense in sight superdome ends up being a very poor example of a s made for tv movie the lone highlight for me was the voice over work from the late charlie jones a sportscaster i miss listening to the eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over hypes the atmosphere in new orleans is pure cheese at its finest like most others who have seen superdome i also did so courtesy of mystery science theater it may be one of the ktma public access episodes but it s one of the best examples of the shows early start so even though i ve only rated superdome a i ll give this episode a generous on my mst k rating scale 
comparison with american graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic speaking of timeliness there was an episode of cheers where norm and cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie they would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong there were sly reference such as they paved paradise to put up a parking lot the filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan the characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie very little of what the characters said were believable combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail although there were two exceptions kelli williams liven things up as the future flower child and despite what another reviewer said rick shroeder was quite good showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in n y p d blues 
when i spotted that noah wyle and ricky schroder were in the same movie i was like score i admit i was eager to see the movie and i have to say the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way then it went all down hill i didn t expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo they took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story i was appalled that noah was involved in anything of the sort especially his role nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the vietnam war if anyone really wants to know how communism was like sit down and read a book on it and not one that praises it or is against it just the cold hard facts i only watched a few scenes here and there only because i wanted to see ricky s body but that was all that interested me everything else about this movie irritated me 
no wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie it s just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a disneyland attraction students fist fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue the watts riots with a cast of ugh dermot mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a mary hartman look alike with the most annoying smile since mr sardonicus noah wyle reads bob dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift drunken virgin rick schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service silly giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of shindig sing horribly off key and actually make it big in the music business and who wrote this compelling dialog i m going to burkley and wear flowers in my hair i think i found someone to buy stick s woody these people are animals these people are my family as the shirelles sing mama said oh brother what a mess this is like a reefer madness of the s except it s not even funny 
couldn t go to sleep the other night so i got up flipped on the tube this movie was on film makers bit off more than they could chew just as ambitious in scope as forrest gump was but gump read like an fairy tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era tgmb just relies on tired clich s to tell the story almost like a broadway musical where actors have to ham it up every character s purpose was to fill a silly s archetype take how we re introduced to finnegan hugging his black maid receiving a framed picture of mlk criminey talk about heavy handed why not just give him a t shirt saying i heart black people sunshine isn t free love groovay man oh no i didn t have my period mary beth i want to go to berkeley not square ucla uh excuse me there was nothing square about la in the s rather than take the time to demonstrate what made berkeley unique we just hear this brat whine about not going there can t even remember the black kid s name he was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are thing is period pieces don t have to be this cheesy take dazed confused look how we re introduced to the football hero randall floyd we don t first see him on the football field in fact we never see him play football we re introduced to him in class inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party in dazed feminism isn t a casual by product of some chick getting knocked up it s much more organic more serious than that it s refined in the ladies room over a flip discussion about gilligan s island serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings but real life is like that some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant i agree which is why i feel so disappointed by this piece of baby boomer pornostalgia 
this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film i am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame 
this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can t believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can t tell me this wasn t the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don t watch this junk 
oh dear god this was horrible there is bad then there was this this movie makes no sense at all it runs all over the map and isn t clear about what its saying at all the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman the fact that edison isn t a real city takes away since i live in vancouver watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable why didn t they make it a real city the only writing that was decent was tilman in which john heard did a fantastic job he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time and the movie be a washout too bad hopefully someone important will see it and at least give john heard credit where credit is due and hire him as lead bad guy again which is where he should be on the a list 
this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can t believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can t tell me this wasn t the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don t watch this junk 
okay just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie well at least i did it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour spoiler it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants the only problem is that her daughter s friend is the girl in the way she always wins the competitions therefore pushing the mother further towards eliminating her after talking to a hitman the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit so actions are taken but she eventually gets caught the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening don t waste your time watching this 
for months i ve been hearing about this little movie and now i ve seen it i find it cute cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people s creative ideas in order to make their own one joke premise of a movie troops swingblade any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywood s door then they re doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films how many times have you heard the phrase it s animal house meets back to the future it s wall street meets dead poet s society or shakespeare in love meets star wars i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable 
there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring just a notch above lowbrow thanks to freeman and spacey who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as justin timberlake s acting i hate to knock the guy but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte the better the movie isn t all bad just mostly i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man he deserves it and unlike his fellow musician and co star he can act kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of ten he s not that good when all is said and done the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters all in all t s just plain boring that being said rent this when you are suffering from insomnia 
after watching this on the mst k episode i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from it seems to combine elements of logans run farenheight final sacrifice and at least several others at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot like the fact that even though gas is unavailable there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f race car going all the way across the country 
dull flatly directed comedy has zero laughs and wastes a great cast alan alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows newcomer anthony lapaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium but it s not enough one of those scripts that if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion 
one of the lamer wedding movies you ll see smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters the ethnic stereotypes are like a henny youngman joke except they just aint in the least bit funny here molly ringwald well what else needs to be said give you a clue to the silliness she destroys a wedding dress because it just won t be me makes it into this rag with straps and puts on a top hat and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy rather than ringwalding her neck its a helluva a cast too check out how heavy ally sheedy is wheeeew 
with this film bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film s might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of objectivity obviously it is not for one reason many scenes shot by pure chance are obvious set ups when that poor goat accidently falls off the cliff you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen for another his concealing of one important information the hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film that is goitre a sickness caused by lack of iodine salt this goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had bunuel only took the time to make his research heck if he checked cretinism in a medical dictionary he d have found goitre he might have ended up telling the truth about these people still doubtfully instead with his film he judges them constantly talking about them as cretins again and again dramatizing the action setting up scenes to create the spectacle all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all mighty objectivity bunuel talks all the time in this film not letting one word to the people he is filming he talks for them and even then judges them this piece is flawed to it s roots to it s ideology and it s a real shame it s considered a great film 
this minute documentary bu uel made in the early s about one of spain s poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films first let s admit that years later spain is much richer than it was then and when i say this i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth it s a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that bu uel favored but with western european style capitalism but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of pi teaching math to poor people the horror bu uel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation what is he proposing that children are taught exactly what at school doesn t bu uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people 
the writer director of this film obviously doesn t know anything about film i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun the story was awful the characters were very one dimensional for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans that someone is kidding their self it was probably the writer director no poker fan in this world likes this movie even your money man hates this project to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn t give you the experience to write about poker keep your day job and if it s playing poker then you must be hurt n 
as a poker enthusiast i was looking forward to seeing this movie especially as it had scotty nyugen in it basically scotty nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for it the characters are unlikeable and annoying the soundtrack is awful and the plot well there isn t one i honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the dvd box after twenty minutes i was that bored its actually ashame that nyugen was in this movie as otherwise i wouldn t have wasted buying it off ebay take it from me avoid like offsuit dire 
when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd they had not viewed it on the silver screen my opinion remains the same the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak 
people please don t bother to watch this movie this movie is bad it s totally waste of time i don t see any point here it s a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again 
an updated version of a theme which has been done before while that in and of itself is not bad this movie doesn t reach the ring like the other inherent and pure evil ones do predictable ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending 
murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made for tv but isn t considering the only actor of any note is bullock although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isn t a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things like remembering to lock your front door when you go out or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower bullock plays cassie mayweather a cop with personal issues don t they all together with her new partner a wet looking ben chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they ve planned and executed the perfect murder as the investigation continues a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood ryan gosling the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless bullock though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield actually he d be better chaplin for his sins is a complete non entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood at least gosling and pitt as the conniving sneering suspects acquit themselves adequately as if dodgy leads weren t bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run murder by numbers has absolutely nothing going for it even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn t redeem it well just a little but still not enough to save it forgettable predictable and redundant this is one film that isn t going to move the cop genre forward as cassie probably says on her next case there s nothing to see here people move along keep moving 
well the writing was very sloppy the directing was sloppier and the editing made it worse at least i hope it was the editing the acting wasn t bad but it wasn t that good either pretty much none of the characters were likable at least minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by it could have ended different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending and what wasn t predictable was done so badly that it didn t matter the ending was not worth watching at all sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies the movie looked rushed also the movie just wasn t really worth seeing and had i paid for it i would have been very mad maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one the movie over all was not horrifibly bad but i wouldn t reccomend it i gave it out of b c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character justin i believe the super smart one and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape it was not pretty anyway if you see it wait for the theater or video unless you like pretty much every movie you see then i guess you ll like this one 
at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles set the plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things or just a lot was edited from the movie the characters identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didn t seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the movie i suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they had if they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didn t so now there s a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opinion don t waste your time or money 
lets enter the world of this movie for a second so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars shouting at them and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief instead of just walking up and pop what do you do the bad guy he talks to him he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun they have nothing to talk about shoot him shoot him now but he talks to him anyway oh another thing at the end a newspaper says pulitzer prize winner story right here or something right above on a front page of a paper when its like the first time the story is printed so how in the heezy did someone win a pulitzer for it that fast yea you know those types of stupid movies yea well that s edison in a nutshell you get mr cool morgan freeman and shifty eyed tough kevin spacey who both phone in their roles completely ll cool j who scowls literally every single moment of the movie while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places and who s last line duck was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made and justin timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks little cocky bastard the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best denzel from training day impression which was pretty entertaining oh yea so whats the movie about eh something about scandals involving the city edison s fictional special unit police force called f r a t i swear i m not making this stuff up which was supposed to be a obvious play off of s w a t anyway little journalistic super singer boy justin timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving undercover cops from frat and he goes scurrying off looking for a story gaining his boss freeman trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought blah blah blah its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day the pacing was slow and off the script was horrible and the acting was extremely uninspired it jumped everywhere without going anywhere people get put in comas and you forget about them everyone in this movie just didn t think damn what a stupid movie its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended no lie basically do not waste your time 
hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse and now only seems to do by the numbers hollywood thrillers this is very lightweight john grisham material crossed with the plot of a tv movie bullock is cass mayweather a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo not good when two unbalanced college maladriots gosling and pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene fair enough but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overly melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass s history then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff side log cabin where there s absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set oooh the atmosphere watch any episode of csi instead it s to the point and far more exciting 
stranger than fiction angered me so much i signed up on imdb just to write this review stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex touching and thought provoking movie until the very end once you suspend multiple lapses of logic why didn t will ferrell hear emma thompson s voice years ago when she fist started writing her book the phone rang the phone rang again how could she not know it s him calling etc the movie challenges one s thoughts about mortality fate and sacrifice the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english majors and maggie gyllenhaal is always a pleasure even though will ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith ah but the ending until the very end i would have given out of stars to this movie the movie as a metaphor for life s journey as a tribute to the notion of writing true as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy but not both is outstanding the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will ferrell s fate and no matter how endearing a character he may have become we know full well why we will accept the ending the last act occurs the screen goes white the credits roll a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film an end that would have been debated for weeks no no credits rolled say it isn t so say hollywood didn t tack on another minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie dustin hoffman got it right when he said it s no longer a masterpiece it s ok an apt review of the movie except to me it wasn t even ok i was so offended about the betrayal of writing true about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie i don t often cry i could care less about most movies but i am still angry about this one my questions for zack helm the writer are this did the original movie end when the screen went white and were you forced by the vapid movie powers that be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself i ve read you re brilliant i hope your original script ended the movie the first time i know zack helm will never see this review and i ve been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself but please movie goers am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction one good thing came from me seeing this movie i doubly admire lost in translation now 
a badly acted two character comedy drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren t we awful to the indians polemic with lousy special effects exploitative use of nudity and ugly violence it s as sincere as a politician s handshake as obvious as a car salesman s pitch one of the worst movies in the history of the universe absolute and utter dreck 
spoilers well the one line summary says it all melville s le samurai is the original and there are elements of leon and they are better much better in the samurai alain delon is a lonely warrior professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs with so much suspense in these scenes even the end is exactly the same the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand the world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it delon is not killing so many people like the ghost dog but i guess jarmusch liked leon very much or even desperado by rodriguez so he added this too and let me guess the girl will become a professional like ghost dog like natalie portman in leon so what was jarmusch thinking after all where is the unique the original thought in this movie i can t see the point in making carbon celluloid copies a rating by macaulay connor
now i ll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie that about sums it up too i disliked this movie to be more specific i disliked the concept of this movie the cinematography was good the mood was nice and the acting was satisfactory however the story is fatuous unacurate and misleading it is also offensive i am a quarter cree indian and for some reason i feel insulted on a personal level by the nature of whitaker s character first of all he s a black guy and this isn t a racist remark i swear the thought of a white hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents the katana represents the soul of a samurai imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside and where the heck did he get a katana anyway it must be one of those replicas which insults the samurai caste even more also ghost dog showed no honor near the end of the movie he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy it s more like a ninjas way silent assassins a group that samurais deny exists but hates none the less then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out his boss is a baddie you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable he kills himself to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to bushido so we have great cinematography good ambiance and so so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it making it an unsatisfactory overall film and an insult to everything a honorable bushi samurai holds dear bleah
happened upon a copy of this not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i d be finding those responsible and demanding it back all i can say is this would be a terrible student film any understanding of the medium of film is absent acting is god awful the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame and the change in tone of the lead character s reaction to the ghost is laughable i can only agree that the glowing reviews of this film are from friends and family i m afraid it s not even entertainingly bad amateur in the extreme avoid avoid avoid 
it s one of those dramas that s so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny the script is absolutely dire direction appalling lighting purely armature the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it s good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard but doesn t at least destroy any speeches there s continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout and finally last but not least the acting is appalling for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this 
this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning but never fleshed out to it s expectations the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas typical of the asian directors but doesn t know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film never finding a solid explainable interesting angle basically the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases the acting was very good however all the actors gave good performances and jude law was outstanding as he is always is it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film 
this is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of awfulness i don t even have the vocabulary to say how dire turgid boring confusing and just plain strange this effort is hey what d ya know i do set in a post apocalyptic america some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue it was all so incomprehensible i couldn t make head or tail of any of it seriously how this got picked up by national lampoon totally defeats me it really is awful and not in a its so bad it s good cult way it is just awful awful awful awful honestly if you still don t believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think even gerbils on acid couldn t hope to understand this avoid or even better destroy 
i expected alot from this movie kinda like lee as a naustradamous like caracter but instead all i got was a waste of time and a boring movie i can t even explain this movie it had wooden acting terrible script from pieces from the bible like hurricanes tidal waves and earthquakes but that was at the end the rest of it i had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn t this movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in china where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest the convent end up being the key to the misshappenings the whole movie is missleading and boring one of lees worst 
end of the world is an uneventful movie which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth the main character is some kind of scientist i m not exactly sure what kind he has two jobs at a government facility guarded by four security men his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job job requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room at least that s the best i can figure apparently the plant is not exactly top secret as the scientist brings his wife there she hangs out they re on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space major earth disruption repeated over and over he says something about it being the first message from space he s ever been able to decipher his wife tells him they re going to be late for the dinner party so they leave and go to the party moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake from there the movie goes nowhere yes christopher lee is in it but that really doesn t help much besides lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii this movie is boring but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z grade sci fi plus there s lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed 
i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good right how wrong i was i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey a director writer of wiseguy making his feature debut blah well the director writer of edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because i cannot see how he along with the other actors in the film would ever agree to be in this disaster this movie is absolutely appalling it s a mixture of every cop hard boiled clich ever there is nothing new with edison the acting was bad and the direction was even worse it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy this was the best casted direct to video movie i ve ever seen some examples of just bad silly moments in edison morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles llcoolj driving a vintage firebird guys being shot in the head this movie is the opposite of good stay away from edison 
dull cheap sci fi thriller made with an almost total lack of conviction a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only one man and is very poorly guarded at night and full of campy sound effects christopher lee is not only wasted but he also gives one of his few i m here strictly for the money performances 
spoilers wow end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la independence day the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he s trying to figure out who s receiving the messages and who s also sending out messages in space he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent they visit it everything looks normal including the priest played by a bored christopher lee but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens disguised as priests and nuns they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet once the alien get the special element the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform lee being the last alien left tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens lee walks in the transporter and he s gone the couple looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world decide to follow the aliens because earth is doomed the couple doesn t see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding the end that s it i ve never seen such a dull movie in my life it s the most underwhelming movie i ve ever experienced the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen they don t care about anything they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide what the heck who needs earth anyway they don t even try to stop them or do something to make things better this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work i wasn t expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production but i didn t expect it to be this bad christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions well i m sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining end of the world is much much much worst it s beyond dull and inert with no entertainment value whatsoever 
your mind will not be satisfied by this no budget doomsday thriller but pray who s will a youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as church people small _apocalyptically themed outing end of the world has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely s similar movies and it s not only that but eotw plays like a hybrid not only doomsday but convent creeps as well the villain of the movie is a well known character actor this wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of convent exploitation that significantly s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated anyway the convent s secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco christopher lee is the pride of end of the world but the end of the world is not at all his pride 
the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns christopher lee who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine the cast are not too bad though most have now retired from acting the film has terrible sound effects mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems and it ridiculously pondering at times showing a scene of the sky for instance for what feels like hours at a time despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world is doomed sort of way and the production is adequate interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie meda band writer frank ray perilli and charles band s assistant bennah burton despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it 
i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial the commercial was great but it i found out later that it had every explosion or special effect in the entire movie about and even some that weren t in the movie there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people i guess my world of innocence ended that day when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies 
that is the only question i am left with why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast why was the writing so bad it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters why did it not make any sense at all why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and hollywood the hell out of it when all it needed was good smart story telling why i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they re released i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey who are oscar winners that this never is released to the big screens in america as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism the whole story is just utterly laughable i just think the script had potential but the execution turned it into a clich and an awful one at that just no

 st watched out of dir jon keeyes over the top rehash of s supposed horror flicks like friday the th versions thru whatever i can t think of much redeeming here except or can i think of anything the story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an homage to this supposedly but lo and behold one of the stupid people have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered again how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this guess what the murderer is at it again and we re tipped off from the very beginning who it is so there goes any mystery whatsoever and besides all this where are the cops and why doesn t someone call them i can t believe this movie was financed by someone and made you would think that by now the american people would be judged a little higher at least in their movie going experience but not so by this filmmaker 
without a doubt this is one of the worst films i ve ever wasted money on the plot is erm sorry did i say there was a plot the scariest moment was when nope can t think of one the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was nope can t think of one for that either you knew who the killer was right from the start there was nothing scary about the whole movie in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister misty in the shower and when you saw nurse toppan take her top off this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie 
 american nightmare is officially tied in my opinion with it s pat for the worst movie of all time seven friends oddly resembling the k mart version of the cast of friends gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare a pirate radio show it s hosted by a guy with a beard that s the most exciting aspect of his show chandler monica joey and oh wait i mean wayne jessie and the rest of the bad one liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj unbeknownst to them a crazed nurse serial killer is listening crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and wait sorry again by making their fears come to life these fears include such stunners as voodoo and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures no really this movie was in a word rotten crazy nurse s killing spree lacks motivation there s nothing to make the viewer jump the ending blows and again voodoo if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones rent american nightmare with them if you care for your loved ones even a little bit go to your local blockbuster rent all of the copies of american nightmare and hide them in your freezer 
when i read the back of the dvd case i thought that it sounded really interesting so i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the for dollars section at blockbuster when we got home and popped in the movie twenty minutes into it we found ourselves turning to each other going this sucks let s put in something else i ll admit a few of the lines from the friends at the caf made us smile a little bit but come on at least get some decent actors every once in a while in a movie if the acting is bad and the movie isn t going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they re over or under doing their lines but i can only take so much crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter there was no delivery for their lines amateur doesn t even come close to the acting in this film anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie it s the most pointless thing i ve ever had the displeasure of watching do not watch or buy this movie 
when it comes to horror movies i am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore sub par production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare this movies simply has no good scares to offer it can t even be enjoyed as camp bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad i felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction i doubt they got any rehearsal either it s embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance it s quite easily one of the worst movies i ve ever seen i don t normally write reviews but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others this movie is a complete waste of time if you must watch this movie don t miss the making of featurette the writer director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move seen it he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it s a new age citizen kane it s like listening to a group of third graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant they truly think they ve created something of substance it s sad really the only reason i gave this movie a is because i think should be reserved for true atrocities like manos hands of fate and space mutiny so american nightmare isn t the worst movie i ve ever seen but i d have to say that it s somewhere in the bottom fifty 
in texas seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the halloween night before going to a party meanwhile they call the american nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears a serial killer who is listening to their confessions makes their nightmares come true killing each one of them in a sadistic way american nightmare is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning without any previous explanation a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area as if it were friday th then the story shifts to a bar where seven friends are celebrating halloween from this moment on the story has a great potential and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies as usual in this type of c production however the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse jane toppan giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting with a better beginning and conclusion this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie my vote is four title brazil agonia agony 
so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film and you might be thinking to yourself huh there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december funny thing is most of these rave reviews sound like they re coming from the same person or at best a small coordinated group of open house groupies the truth my friends is that this film is truly unwatchable just because it s independent doesn t mean it gets a free pass if you re going to make a musical whether on film or on stage whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse you should probably make sure that a your actors can sing b your actors can dance c you have decent sound equipment d you have a well written score and e you have lyrics that are witty and charming even anthony rapp can t save this one it s one of those unfortunate movie going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved 
the single worst film i ve ever seen in a theater i saw this film at the austin film festival in and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival it was an interesting premise and seemed like it could go somewhere but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything first of all if you re going to do a musical find someone with musical talent the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming the lyrics were terribly written and when they weren t obvious rhymes they were groan inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work and you d think you d find people who could sing when making a musical right not in this case luckily they were half talking half singing in rhyme most of the time but when they did sing it made me cringe especially when they attempted to sing in harmony and that just addresses the music some of the acting was pretty good but a lot of the dialog was terrible as well as most of the scenes they obviously didn t have enough coverage on the scenes or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again 
did heidijean really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with maybe i m expecting too much for a lifetime movie played days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie 
carly pope plays jj a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant overbearing mother moves in with her jj aghast at this turn of events then blackmails restaurant owner alex to entertain her mother in exchange for maybe reviewing his dying restaurant alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother there are numerous problems with this movie the characters are universally dimensional jj is a self serving hateful character her mother superficial and shallow jj s colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic the underlying message of an over woman unable to make it on her own without male assistance is bad bad bad the acting is uniformly dull the script uninspired the films only saving grace is the setting of new york city i would so not recommend this film 
having seen men behind the sun i guess i hoped for an evolution in style technique to match the larger scale of this movie i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard hitting fact based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocities but this is not it this plays like a bottom to mid tier european nazi exploitation movie from the s e g ss experiment camp etc perhaps more like deported women of the special section actually granted it has a greater scope and more people running around but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots spiced up with the occasional poorly executed shock sequence the admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power watch channel s the holocaust aired recently still running as of no for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war featuring excellent in context use of actual footage this is the type of treatment the horror of nanjing deserves not this hackneyed exploitation garbage a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie rating as exploitation as a treatment of the subject 
although i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie this sure as hell wasn t what i would have had in mind had anything actually come to mind once i heard of its existence all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don t eat the babies unfortunately i could only find a copy under its alternate title island fury looking back i guess i could call it a lose lose situation on one hand i still don t get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don t eat the babies and on the other hand island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful pointless boring unwatchable piece of garbage yeah definitely lose lose i m not even sure what genre they re going for here just early s badness with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non flashback first up two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys once caught the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere and this is where things start to get weird somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island years earlier when they were only i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is so now we re in the past while the girls try to retrace their steps so these bad guys don t kill them although i wouldn t have minded if they had in the flashback the year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends eventually stopping by an island for some air they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up but the flashback was undeniably better than the present which still isn t saying much for a while there i had forgotten about the original story at one point i ithought maybe the director had too and when the flashback ended that would be the end which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half hour shorter this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end and real stuff does happen but it s stupid i guess i didn t exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured or anything like that but i did expect some form of outlandish b entertainment mostly just a confusing inept storyline unsure of its genre my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures if anyone i would only recommend this one to serious b movie collectors who must have them all anyone else interested probably has brain damage what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don t eat the babies 
first of all i just want to say that i love this show but this episode this episode makes a mockery of the entire show i don t know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series there is no story line everything is chaotic and the jokes are crap the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game for example how do the furlings look like by creating that stupid previously on is simply embarrassing its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad 
i bought bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again the excessive amount of watery blood at the beginning is just plain obsolete not to mention the whip around wind sounds my friends and i made a super low budget movie and the effects still exceeded this crap fest as for the amount of mistakes in this movie there are way too many to count i knew one of the actors believe it or not he was my theatre teacher ha final verdict don t bother with this horror flick stars out of a possible 
my wife and i watch a film every night with no distractions and mostly artsy films that require thought i have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom my wife has double the attention span that i do all that being said this film is just plain empty and boring it went nowhere never blossomed it started fairly strong with a promising plot then she bakes cookies goes to spain she sulks she stares the credits roll uneven full of holes false starts dead ends we ff d through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried zzzz it s like a beautifully shot chick flick that s pretending to be deep or artsy you never get to know nor understand morvern at all about halfway through you just don t care anymore we just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop don t waste your time on this i m shocked it scores so high 
there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning and that ignorant fools like me don t get it obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood dross it has every a hem artistic clich in the book i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense the director of the almost equally embarrassing movie ratcatcher returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers 
it was probably just my dvd but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd i had to turn up the volume on my tv to the highest possible level in order to hear about percent of the dialog some of the talking still remained sub audible if you re from scotland you might have a chance albeit a slim one peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds including unwrapping a package footsteps even puffing on a cigarette with the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard i can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment such as a disco and that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down there is art and there is art even in the field of audio mixing but this effort in a time of war would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity after about a half hour i gave up having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture either 
i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen besides the dead body in the first scenes and her disposal of him i was wrong it was a cinema verite of betty hits the beach encased for the first part by mordant morven i really don t care what young lassies from scotland do these days who thy screw what drugs they take visually the stroll through the cabo de gata in andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me the nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts that s all there is now i see why her boyfriend killed himself rename it bare bitch boredom or what i did on my trip to spain i m such a sucker for sticking these things out 
my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is but he goes on watching it none the less that is his right as an american i guess but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can t stand i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along get the pun ha ha like spielberg did it s like jesus before he became a man or thats at least what i think that would feel like any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this even though it contains little of peter falk i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo s investigation as many later episodes would do 
my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke little did we realize the joke was on her for paying for it while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles these included drinking bleach rubbing sand in my eyes writing a letter to brad sykes and garrett clancy re enacting the american civil war tax returns gcse maths sex with an old lady garrett clancy aka sgt ben draper wrote this the guy couldn t even dig a hole properly the best ting he did was kick a door down the best part of the film this was the worst film i have ever seen and i ve seen white noise the light never has a film had so many mistakes in it my girlfriend left it here so now i live with the shame of owning this piece of crap news just in owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself fact do not watch
i m a fan of arty movies but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel agonisingly slow to develop a non existent plot based on a promising premise the experience is shall we say trying even after bad movies i feel that i learn something or enjoyed some aspect but there there was nothing to appreciate the premise was not uninteresting but the movie starts and ends there the acting was ok though the characters were utterly boring for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal she is mightily empty pity i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content 
it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person not even as an extra that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general however no spoilers only a brief introductory description buddy portrays four young people living in a flat share in oslo the protagonist are two young men that don t manage to direct their life in any serious fashion and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility a sort of fear of growing up the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models quite the clich although the story is mildly funny the acting is good and as a young person one can sort of identify with the characters `crazy situations and complicated love affairs i don t find the story or the characters very believable to polished and lacking in depth this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as `friends yes that show on tv has norwegian film finally found its identity audience pleasers in well known american style how about watching lukas moodysson s tillsammans together 
since rugrats falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years obviously the tyrants at klasky csupo should be out of ideas after dumbing down all of the characters adding even stupider new ones replacing some voices though i like nancy cartwright she is not chucky finster and having no sense of continuity ex in a kimi episode i watched the other day tommy and chucky each got a new puppy but it subsequent episode the aforementioned dogs never appear you d think the creators could kill the show for mercy but noooo all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks while not as horrible as the kimi episodes everyone is even stupider than they were including grandpa my god he used to be the best character on the show but now he has no real purpose the ending is needlessly fluffy and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes is that the kids can interact with adults whoa what fun no stars at all for the rugrats all growed up klasky csupo please destroy this show before it gets any worse 
 comments contain spoilers i was barely holding on to this show as appointment tv when they started the annoying music under every scene when don epps was averaging almost a shooting per case when the very nasally diane farr was obviously pregnant but we weren t to notice and when colby was a f g triple agent but now in tonight s episode david is trapped with a paranoid nut job who is an obvious amateur with a gun in an elevator and he can t disarm him a trained experienced field agent who has been st through the door many times and is experienced in hand to hand fighting can t take out a nut job not when said nut job blinks looks away drops his head closes his eyes not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for seconds then the scene came that let me know that as much as i enjoy learning from the chubby frumpish but very charming charles epps and his sexy sidekick love interest amita my friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged don gives david the distress word that is the code for the s t is about to go down david is ready they kill the lights drop the elevator startle the nut job and david cannot disarm kill beat into submission the nut job the bad guy ends up with both guns david ends up shot i m done hope the numb rs are fun 
here let me wave my hands over the keyboard i ll tell you what salad she s going to order over and over works like a charm he s such a genius omg how does he do it my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i m scanning channels i have to be very careful these days it s useful far too often so i don t need it getting broken on idiotic crap like this careful with that remote is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of uberman control and mastery or what why does it exist this is the most inane show completely unbelievable and contrived and i cannot understand why it s still on the air so may geeks give so much better shows such a hard time sarah connor chronicles true blood but give this nonsensical drivel a pass shows like firefly if there were any like that fall away after a season but mindless stuff like this that makes zero logical sense just keeps marching on yeccch 
the math aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow although his career must have been undeservedly waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock the lame ness of the math aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co starring lou diamond phillips which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned in order to catch a fugitive the mathematician uses some theory about bubbles so he gives this long explanation that if we have seen the suspect in places a b and c then we can use bubble theory to calculate where he might be he does this all on a chalkboard or maybe with a stick in the dirt i cant remember anyway when you look at the finished product he basically took three spots and picked a point right in the middle and said ok mathematically here s where we are most likely to find the fugitive at which point one other character points out oh that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live is that math its not even connect the f k g dots this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to support points that every one else had already agreed on through either less complex analysis or basic common sense it just goes to show when you re a hammer everything looks like a nail i can t wait til they stick the numb rs team on osama they ll use calculus call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields cuz hey its all about the numbers totally ludicrous tv show 
this is really really bad lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric i got the evidence on you makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i couldn t find it on itunes talk about seeing into the future too funny for words the rest of the movie is forgettable the score and songs are more interesting than the script ditto the sequel which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies doesn t say much for the world s viewing habits 
 cia codename alexa is an absolute horrible rip off of luc besson s classic film la femme nikita the film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the cia and is forced to do a secret mission for them pretty much the same story structure of la femme nikita the acting combo of lorenzo lamas and o j simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history lamas acting is simply a bad steven segal impersonation watching orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience the writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable there are so many action movie conventions in the film it is ridiculous unnecessary car explosions people flying thru glass windows terrorists bad ponytails etc the musical score resembles david michael frank s score for hard to kill which furthers the steven segal theme of this movie there is plenty of martial arts in the film and it is pretty well done for a low budget american production the mindless action and over the top acting never lets up and i have to admit i was mildly entertained lorenzo lamas had the look of an action star back in the early s but he is certainly no action star that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters my recommendation is that you skip cia codename alexa and check out la femme nikita instead 
spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie lorenzo lamas does his usual tough guy pretty boy act and his future real life ex kathleen kinmont is ass kicking hot chick alexa oj simpson is a detective coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona translation cable tv filler there isn t enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure the script has some gaping holes best worst moment in one jarring scene oj s partner expresses his aversion to the morgue oj responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot or words to that effect this vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released it is truly appalling and therefore entertaining in an unintentional horrible way i was so startled that i laughed until champagne came out of my nose now that s a guilty pleasure bc
as an impressionable year old i liked the love conquers all philosophy of the s sitcom bridget loves bernie i did understand the controversy which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver david birney and an irish catholic school teacher meredith baxter and both sets of parents harold j stone and bibi osterwald as bernie s parents audra lindley and david doyle as bridget s parents who have issues with the young couple s interfaith marriage looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences i am amazed that the show was even a success for one albeit highly rated season created by veteran tv writer bernard slade who a few years after the show s cancellation would write the successful play same time next year bridget loves bernie was a very light superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight there was no denying the real life chemistry between birney and baxter but in later years both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects birney in his short lived role in st elsewhere and baxter in family and family ties here they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses all in the family and mary tyler moore both of those shows were smart funny and had enough of an edge more so on the former that the latter that kept my interest in the situation and the characters bridget loves bernie was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered 
this film was hard to get a hold of and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming i mean this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt with all of this built in interest how could anyone make such a lackluster talk laden flick of this true life event while williams is always interesting the screenwriters assumed that the d b cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star s what we get is a type without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction shame on this film for even existing 
as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true life tale i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been the bad i m a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage mouth from what i read there were several directors replacing each other on this film and that s too bad you can tell things aren t right with the story i couldn t get involved with treat williams portrayal of cooper either he should have been fascinating but he wasn t in this movie it s also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of folk hero but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy too not everything was disappointing i can t complain about the scenery from the lush green forests of oregon to the desert in arizona i d like to see this movie re made and done better because it is a one of a kind story 
i can t believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty disgust and stupidity there s something about mary leaves little reason to stay until the end sure cameron diaz is very pretty but that is never going to be enough to save a movie ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot and is obviously very talented but the movie is a loser not once were any of the scenes believable the shots were badly timed and poorly framed the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid the bonus is from the one time i smiled it s not like i m immune to humor or alone in my opinion my wife hated it too the next day we saw rush hour and laughed ourselves silly this movie just stunk 
to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn t mean it is a terrorist thing it also show s how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn t mean we are all bad we just try to live day at a time like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like blow up or yaser saying we ll blow away the competition and people took it the wrong way being a muslim i know that stuff like this don t usually happen but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq its not right things are not like that people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act i am glad a show like this came on the air there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name 
who likes awful comedy shows like little mosque on the prairie the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are one muslims and self proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn t even matter if the show is good or funny at all which it is not two old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable badly written stale jokes cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left i d be curious who even writes for this show do you think it s actually muslims or hip funny young people no i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the s when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are air farce was only finally just taken off the air thank goodness but we still have lame ducks like this hour has minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for not to mention this poor excuse for comedy little mosque on the prairie it is supposed to be offencive and funny only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching 
if you re looking to be either offended or amused or both you ll probably have to look elsewhere lmotp really isn t even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clich s at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it s just another lame innocuous and anti septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing and once the zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao hype wears out its welcome the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it s so shallow when judged on its merits alone unless you re obsessed with muslim culture in the west and or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don t see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural ethnic dichotomy in western multi ethnic societies lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight 
i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it s getting talked about i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true but there really wasn t anything funny about these stereotypical characters the fresh of the boat dad who doesn t understand his daughter the radical feminist muslim daughter who by the way is a terrible actress and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can he s a pretty good actor i only see him getting better it is very contrived and the dialog doesn t flow that well there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and don t really care to watch another episode i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again she s always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesn t have the same acting abilities 
little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most easily offended viewers which for cbc means year old farmers in saskatchewan the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can t believe it the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don t blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as controversial well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has minutes royal canadian air farce and rick mercer s report 
this show is a perfect example of how the cbc should stick to either news sports or satirical sketch comedy as a developer of situation comedy cbc has shown it can combine the pizazz of king of kensington with the belly laughs of the beachcombers it is an embarrassment to great shows like kids in the hall and second city that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production i have to admit that i didn t give this show much of a chance right from when i first heard of its concept to start half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip off one of the few sitcom successes in english canadian history corner gas the rest of the concept the cultural clash is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness the selection of the muslim religion as the basis for the fish out of water characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be edgy and topical but comes off as forced some of the jokes that are based around the local s reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved especially the audience this show is a perfect example of how cbc just doesn t get it when it comes to creating canadian content especially when presenting canada as a multicultural environment cultural diversity in canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy handed and forced way it would be a refreshing change to see cbc introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity i doubt that cbc has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle a comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in corner gas i e the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines more realistically their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics that being said even as a formulaic fish out of water comedy this show fails the acting is weak the comic pacing all over the map and the story premises that i saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief even for a comedy the only saving grace is the talented derek mcgrath who is horribly wasted here i doubt that even the addition of guest stars colin mochrie for example as an anglican archbishop can save this dog i decided to give the show a chance once the cbc s hype had died down but two episodes were all i could stand i could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline the time slot would be better served by airing more coronation street air farce re runs or dr who even an infomercial would be an improvement 
while i have never been a fan of the original scooby doo due to its horrid production values it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by hanna barbera without a doubt scrappy doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scooby doo characters with it whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show i think death is preferable the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny annoying and grates on the nerves and this is only in the better episodes after many years it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess i can see why in the live action scooby doo movie they made the villain scrappy doo since practically everyone hates him 
wow here it finally is the action movie without action in a real low budget setting don t miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times of a future seattle we find a no brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly matrix without having the money to do it right yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot outs secs approx but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody s attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then and yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get in fact it doesn t deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money 
awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n g find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound i rated it so high b c there aren t any negative scores in the imdb com rating system zaphoid ps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is it s called an indirect proportionality quality star power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is less z
a story of amazing disinterest kills the psychic over and over again the characters and plot are completely uninteresting as is fulci s mad camera work which is usually a redeeming factor in his films and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found it s padded out to an insufferable degree by the end you won t be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom and like me maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep jennifer o neill s performance deserves occupancy in a better movie fulci gorehounds beware there s just not much going on in the psychic 
how did mike hammer live in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace nah he d knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face that s how spillane wrote trash paperbacks for sure but how do you make it worse give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office add some over the hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw up the story line by some retard drugged out screen writer that s how 
this is one of the worst films i ve ever seen i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel and i wish i hadn t i turned it off after a little less than an hour though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes i wish i had it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last or so minutes which would be impossible i would in no way recommend this its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the th century i don t think as many people say that it is that the bell jar is necessarily unfilmable but this particular rendition could have been done without i d almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice 
jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screen s most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin larry peerce s direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy robert klein certainly think it s the former and his self centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film normally i don t like to let myself get so ascerbic but the bell jar is one of my all time favorite books and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy 
the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the s this show quack pack shouldn t even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales it s about a teen aged huey dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg there s no references of scrooge mcduck the stories are repetitive the plot is boring but the animation is good if you want lots of slapstick humor i recommend this to you if you want a better disney show watch darkwing duck or ducktales 
saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw first the adults did not age when the children did for years several parts of the film had continuity problems for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the years passed the copy i saw was missing about minutes or so at least a huge gap with black screen appeared it is too bad because even though the script left something to be desired bergman russell both did fine in the film in their roles it is a shame the large chunk is missing but what is here is watchable i just wish it was all intact the script makes little sense in that bergman s character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults some of the time lines don t make sense either there is a stock market crash that resembles but the kids grow up to fight in world war all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine just wonder what was in the gap of film i could not see as it was missing 
by columbia was a full fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm paramount or warners that s the best thing that could be said about adam had four sons a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman top billed for the first time in an american film and warner baxter bergman plays a frenchwoman this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another hired as governess to baxter s four sons and staying on with one interruption caused by the stock market crash of until the boys are grown men serving in world war i just about everyone in the movie is so goody good it s a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through she s about the only watchable person in the movie even though she s clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh it s also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted the valley of decision four years later 
you d think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better sadly the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain addled the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family everything is so very peachy and swell the family adores bergman and things couldn t be more perfect well that is until the mother fay wray dies the stock market crashes in wiping out the family s fortune and bergman is forced to go back home to france this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet but not bad later after the family s fortunes have improved bergman returns the four boys are now all grown and there isn t really a conceivable reason why they d hire her once again as a governess but briefly everything is swell once again but when wwi occurs the four all go to war gosh in the midst of this one of the sons david brings home his new wife susan hayward miss hayward s character is as black and white as the others though while they are all good and swell she s obviously a horny she devil to make things worse she comes to live in the family home while david is at war now here is where the movie gets really really dumb brain achingly dumb hayward begins an affair with one of david s brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her not hayward with jack why why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the gutter snipe once and for all this is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad and most likely did the same to the audiences back in the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for hayward s evilness to be exposed this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess as expected however the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut hayward the film suffers because of poor writing hayward s affair made no sense at least in how it was handled and having characters who are so gosh darn good or evil with nothing in between sinks this movie to the level of a second rate soap the only thing that saves it at all is the acting they tried as best they could with a turgid script suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken 
i was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever i didn t realize it was disney until it was too late i was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story it was as if someone made a movie out of a th grader s book report on the novel meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses mrs murray meg s mother was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet and that s just the beginning by halfway through the movie i found myself shouting at the screen much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn t read the book i wish i had more thumbs so i could give four thumbs down for this one the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book this movie is kinda alright 
after the success of scooby doo where are you they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show but unfortunately they added a new character that spoilt scooby doo success forever they invented a new show with a new title scooby and scrappy doo it was scrappy doo that made this show a complete failure probably for both adults and kids together scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain and they were also trying to stop him scooby doo doesn t need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews if they wanted scooby doo to be more successful they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy this was just poor maybe your kids will prefer it 
i have never read the book a wrinkle in time to be perfectly honesty after seeing the movie do i really want to well i shouldn t be reviewing this movie i ll start off with that next i ll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable do you know why i say that because i forgot what happens in it i told you it was forgettable to be perfectly honest no tv movie will ever be better than merlin how do i describe a tv movie i have never written a review for one before well i ll just say that they usually have some celebrities a wrinkle in time includes only one alfre woodard or woodward i am not sure the oscar winner the film has cheesy special effects a mildly interesting plot scenes that make you go wtf the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go wtf what did i expect it s a tv movie they usually aren t good as is this one a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster to top it off you ll most likely forget about it the second it s over well maybe not the second it s over but within a few minutes a wrinkle in time 
i have loved this book since my th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago and i have read it to every one of my rd and th grade classes over my past years of teaching supposedly a movie had been made in the past but i d never been able to locate it well my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l engle s excellent book to the screen as i watched the movie i had the highest of hopes as the film went on i became more and more despondent they had botched it badly never had i been so let down by a favorite book to film adaption i understand that films can t stick strictly to a book but they don t need to change things for the sake of it most if not all of departures from the book were totally unnecessary i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie well it wasn t just me nearly every single one felt the same way cheated out of the great story that madeline l engle had so skillfully created why they wondered did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie why couldn t calvin s hair have been red why did mrs which not have the proper witch like outfit that was such a clever play on her name basically we all wondered why did nearly every single detail have to be changed i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make i am still waiting for that movie this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses i m going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task 
i really didn t like this movie because it didn t really bring across the messages and ideas l engle brought out in her novel we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it i m afraid i can t say the same for the film there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn t do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l engle this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating don t see this movie if you are a big fan of l engle s texts because you will be sorely disappointed however if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes or educational as was my case then it is an alright movie 
i have read the whole a wrinkle in time book and then saw the movie the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was pages and the film was hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg charles wallace and calvin must team together to find meg s father and get off the island camazotz the beginning of the film is really a stinker the acting is awful the direction is laughable and so far the situations aren t necessary i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie made a great book and a terrible film the acting is worse than any straight to video acting yes i got to admit there was cool effects but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie i wish could give it a but sadly i can only give it a half could have been useful 
the wrinkle in time book series is my favorite series from childhood i have read and re read them more times than i can count over the last years the characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that i love so much to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement if you have never read the book s i imagine you will enjoy the movie the acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie and the story is interesting however if you love the books avoid this movie at all costs i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel in an interview with newsweek l engle said of the film i expected it to be bad and it is i like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind 
this abc straight to tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time ms madeleine l engle brought children and adults alike into a magical fantastical and original world like no author before her this novel the first in her time quartet is a beautiful take on life the universe and time itself yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms l engle s work of art honestly what were they thinking the effects look cheap and ridiculous the plot is mushy and uneven the dialogue is far fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent worthy director guillermo del toro david yates alfonso cuar n makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece this adaptation can only be compared to boring fake and cheap motel room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience 
awful this thriller should have buried what a piece of crap terrible writing characters are less than believable horrible schlock stick some b stars in a terribly written pos to try and give it a little credit but it fails miserably if i didn t have to write ten lines about this movie i would have given it a word word review it starts with sh and ends with it horrible ending retarded who writes this crap the ending of this film is so contrived weak it s as if they had no idea what to do with this story line or they just ran out of money most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie it s a good thing that these actors are on the way out because this would be a career killer good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it at least no one important like future investors it could have ended a thousand different ways but as it is i feel cheated out of my precious time don t bother with this one you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back 
i regret every single second of the time i lost while watching this movie really unhappily i always find it hard to switch off a movie once i started watching it especially when it s such a classic or what people use to call a classic i think that this is one of those movies every movie lover should have watched at least one time so that was why i watched it don t get me wrong i like humphrey bogart and his wife lauren bacall both as a couple and as actors but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion no really good plot neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story well not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether bogey and bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another i think to have and have not is very overrated and bogart was in many better films during the s 
this is one of those films that i could only sit through once charlotte henry is fine in fact all the actors were fine the problem was in the script the dialog the direction the editing the sets and the special effects granted this was but it really creaked part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen gary cooper w c fields and cary grant are not recognizable there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming the movie just clumped along with no cohesion much of lewis carrols spirit humor and continuity are missing what a pity it s such a great book i would recommend disney s version 
i saw this film at a pre release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills as i recall the film s producers and director were in attendance presumably to gage our reaction many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience which would have been fine if it had been a comedy but it was supposed to be a horror film if the audience wasn t scared it seems the filmmakers were they delayed release for over a year out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they d re cut it as far as i can tell they hadn t it was the same lousy movie just a year older it almost qualifies as so bad it s good but it s slow paced and boring 
film starts in japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide it s a very gory bloody sequence then it jumps to present day well to be precise ted edward albert wife laura susan george and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby s work they rent a house and surprise surprise it just happens to be the house where the murders took place the three dead people are around as ghosts the makeup is hysterically bad and make life hell for the family sounds ok but it s really hopeless there s a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious they look so fake i swear i saw the strings pulling one along and they re muttering there s a pointless sex sequence in the first minutes probably just to show off george s body another one about minutes later but that was necessary to the plot and a really silly exorcism towards the end the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed as for acting albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend but george as always is terrific in a lousy film she gives this film a much needed lift but can t save it i m giving this a just for her and the gory opening and closing that aside this is a very boring film 
i don t think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it s over if you were ever scared this doesn t really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn t tack on one of those happy endings story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto japan so that ted fletcher edward albert can write a book and he brings along his wife laura susan george and their daughter amy amy barrett their friend alex curtis doug mcclure who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted about years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher s arrive it doesn t take long before strange things start happening spoiler alert at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher s and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair meanwhile ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help unfortunately the ghosts get ted laura and alex to play out their death scene like it happened years earlier this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked first it doesn t have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons instead it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts secondly it has susan george in the cast i ve always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn t have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it s one of the reasons why she was so popular but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically this isn t a bad film but it s never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career 
the film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads kushiata kyoto japan a young japanese trainee samurai named masanori toshiya maruyama walks up the winding path to the house inside waits otami mako hattori with whom he is having an affair behind her husband shugoro s tsuiyuki sasaki as toshiyuki sasaki back who happens to be masanori s teacher shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other his honour destroyed the enraged samurai brutally murders both otami and masanori before committing suicide over a century later and ted fletcher edward albert arrives in japan on a working holiday with his wife laura susan george and their young daughter amy amy barrett their close friend alex curtis doug mcclure who works for the american consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay you don t need me to you where he jokingly says it s going so cheap because it s haunted to which both ted and laura laugh off as they obviously don t believe in ghosts at least for the time being that is almost immediately the film goes into clich mode lights turn on and off by themselves laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local zen monk henry mitowa gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it s too late which they ignore of course the spirits of otami masanori and shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a majyo witches tsuyako olajima curse put upon them but there may be a way they can break the curse unfortunately for the fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage daughter and possibly even their very lives directed by kevin connor i thought this was a pretty average film ok to watch once if you ve got nothing better to do but after a day or two you ll probably have completely forgotten it nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there s nothing particularly good about the film either the script by robert suhosky from the novel by james hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by the numbers a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn t help things there are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get amy and her babysitter noriko mayumi umeda and there is a scene where the zen monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in however that is until ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in some exorcism one more thing i think it was a bad idea to have doug mcclure who was when he made this try his hand at kung fu and oriental sword fighting george gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with mcclure although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there s no blood gore or violence to speak about the transparent ghost effects are ok but they ain t going to impress many people these days it s professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in america england or any western country without having to change a thing an ok time waster 
at the beginning of the film you might double check the dvd cover and re read the synopsis a couple of times but no worries it s not memoirs of a geisha that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara kiri ritual suicide through disembowelment cut to present day when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago from then onwards this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional let s start with the good aspects namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all time favorite british horror wench well together with britt eckland linda hayden and ingrid pitt the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan s ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress in this possessed state she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests so strictly spoken it s not really evil that dwells in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long dead hands obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the light blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ghostbusters the house where evil dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever throughout most of the running time you ll be wondering whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films motel hell and from beyond the grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over the top like motel hell maybe but then again everyone in the cast continues to speak his her lines with a straight and sincere face so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed the house where evil dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn t even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over sized spiders or are they crabs in the daughter s bedroom how totally random and irrelevant was that if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demon mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba 
from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb this movie seems to get ragged on a lot but i didn t think it was that bad i ve seen much worse actually the house where evil dwells is a ghost story about a husband and his wife ted and laura fletcher and their daughter amy who move into an old house in japan little do they know a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover and then killed himself years earlier with a samurai sword as strange things happen in the house the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living and plan on re enacting the bloody murder that took place years back i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story it was routine and it was corny but i ve seen worse in my day the ghost sequences were a little over done we get to see the translucent blue tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family and take over their bodies to be honest the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland i may be mistaken but after watching this it seemed to me that the japanese horror film ju on the grudge and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place ghostly activity curses put on the home etc but i may be wrong to sum it up this is a pretty corny ghost story don t go out of your way to see it but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot 
i just rented and watched this movie just to see what s all the fuss about so here s what my reactions to it are it s easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film however the movie doesn t shock or disturb me at all it just bored me this movie could be easily shortened to under minutes all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described below contains spoiler i find the rape scenes quite tame i don t know if i have watched the cut or uncut version if there is actually such a version i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot here s a list on top of my mind why don t the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are that would be an excellent time why don t they just gang rape her instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifer s ordeal by such a long time it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right they shouldn t send a coward imbecile to do the job why didn t jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left which should be the first thing that pops up in most people s mind especially for someone who is a writer why didn t these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alive i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him ends spoiler but hey this movie is not without its merits camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer `why me why me i didn t even c^m 
i ve seen the gator bait films and this is almost exactly the same thing as those a woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them the thing that sets this movie apart from those ones although not very far is that the sexual content is not glorified there is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film but not for a second is it ever sexy some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive but that s only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience s need to see this woman seek revenge this is a weak film it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers i spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral but i was glad to see that since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead it was not meant to pass off as a t a film b movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality and while i spit on you grave is unmistakably a b movie and contains more than its share of nudity the nudity does not drive the plot on the other hand the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists these men are evolutionary drop outs just like they were in the gator bait films and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless b movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind but instead it simply satisfies the audience s desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve the one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks oddly the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity although not by much but it is by far the most painful to watch we are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord but again this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with spoilers you know that this is all the movie means to do since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed the woman does not live happily ever after she doesn t write her book she doesn t leave and never return to that nightmare place she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks but hey what more did you expect oh and did you read the tagline if you decide to waste your time watching this try and find any man getting broken or burned i was really looking forward to those 
i m not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there s almost no plot anyway i ve seen several reviewers call isoyg an anti rape film or even a feminist statement and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims first of all what do we see on the cover of this movie that s right a shapely woman s behind whether it was zarchi s attempt to make an anti rape statement and i absolutely don t believe it was is entirely beside the point the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual penetration is shown that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it the rape s in the film is uncomfortable brutal and hard to watch there s something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly minutes none there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed mere moments before he s murdered so the scene isn t at all engaging on an emotional level really it s just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb caligula cannibal ferox etc that it attracts only the exploitation crowd finally a few reviewers have commended zarchi s so called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack but considering how inept everything else in the film is acting script etc i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn caliber actors do their thing i m not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg i m all for exploitation horror and love video nasties in fact i m giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films however it s also poorly made and after the rape occurs just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho hum mostly gore less murders and wait for the credits to roll this is probably worth watching once if you re a hardcore s exploitation fan but i m telling you the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation 
being a filmmaker myself and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour i thought i was in for a treat when i took home my wrongs not that the dvd cover gives anything away instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director chris morris a short film including scenes i should have known better really and avoided this insipid and often offensive piece of twoddle the scene in the church is repulsive to watch especially since we are all too familiar with morris s warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious tv series brass eye and serves no purpose other than to shock how this film is labelled a comedy i will never understand the runner s commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle having been a runner myself it s often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process however this is sadly not the case here instead we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs this is all very interesting but not worth a single frame of celluloid to say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement it relies far too heavily upon its heightened style at the expense of plot character and dialogue leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled its over simplified message that man should take responsibility for his actions is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated the film does have its moments of pseudo kafkaesque surrealism but ultimately it fails to convince to entertain to enlighten and just ends up being irritating if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking i strongly recommend franz kafka s it s a wonderful life by peter capaldi 
one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked one of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they the yuppies are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies 
without wishing to be a killjoy brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clich d films i ve ever seen this being one of them and camp blood being another the acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap i bought this for but remember you can t put a price on minutes of your life you d do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price 
enough is enough sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead the first tremors movie was great the second one was ridiculous the third one was nauseating the tv series was depressingly awful and this movie just drives the stake deeper basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry now we have the series set in the wild west in the s and they fight graboids like a rehash of the first one they have to learn how to beat them all over again mildly entertaining i suppose otherwise this straight to video release just like tremors and is just going way too far oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event i think something like this would be history making so our pals in the first film wouldn t be so unprepared movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy avoid this garbage 
warning this review contains minor spoilers well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas i m a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare tremors the legends begins however is a very dull movie where the heck are the graboids due to the relative lack of graboids through the first minutes i m convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a character study unfortunately there isn t one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago s character who is given too few lines too little to do and in the end too little screen time what saved the nd and rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer whenever there wasn t any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and or watch however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute on the plus side when the graboids dirt dragons in this movie are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets i was impressed when i saw that tremors was listed at minutes long pretty good for straight to video but after watching it i m sure that this movie is a good minutes too long there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn t further the plot any was there a rush to get this movie made i think not more time could have and should have been spent on the script i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors packaged for sale with tremors what luck i thought pay for get for free well after watching tremors i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free i can t imagine paying a single dime for tremors for fans of the series it s best to forget that tremors the legend begins even exists tremors the legend begins rates a out of 
i found tremors the legend begins to be dull and boring all the action scenes were stupid the so called graboids are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat if not smaller the acting was horrendous and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed the story is so dumb and useless also if you want to tell a story way back in time make sure you use the same actor michael gross to be someone in the past when he s someone in the present in the other tremor movies geez if you haven t seen this film don t waste your time stick to tremors and for a good time this film however make sure you re remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense 
there are no reasons to watch this movie should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life s every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill like that would ever happen then get this movie from the video shop if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk go figure but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie claudia udy showing her chest sadly no other reason than that 
before seeing this movie i would ve said that i loved everything kathy bates has done now it s everything minus one james woods is pathetic not his character his acting someone should ve told him that poor is not synonymous with dirty nor ignorant nor cliche ditto for randy quaid s stereotyping the only redeeming feature is henry thomas who isn t a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess if you enjoy the country you ll enjoy the scenery that s the best i can give it i m a serious fan of both independent and quirky films but this is simply terrible 
this is not a children s movie this movie is like a bad acid trip for kids under the age of for a month my year old from time to time would ask me why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth or why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits and that wasn t the worst of it we stopped it about a hour in but the damage had been done intensely morbid oppressive violent fortunately he s finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges go ahead censure me my conscience is clear 
probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this they might not have read the book they might enjoy gore and violence in a film they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here the only thing i liked about this film is the song bright eyes if perchance you happen to be one of those people who has read the book enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence you are sure not to like this otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this like in the book a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come only a few rabbits including his brother hazel believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live 
how many more of those fake slice of life movies need to be made hopefully not too many raising victor vargas is a very self conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood nothing wrong with that in general what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich in the book of supposedly edgy hollywood independent production it s supposed to be real so left shake the camera documentary style except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose it s edgy so let s not waste any time lighting the film it s hip so let s have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarface and so on and so forth all that you are left with is a very self conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that won t impress anyone outside of the rarefied indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film 
ok i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a classic and a standard part of most people s childhood but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of i must admit i really hated it we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it and many people who whimpered at the very words watership down their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams recommended it to be honest i wish i hadn t bothered i gave it the benefit of the doubt generally i don t like to stop watching a film half way through this was an exception it was really really excruciatingly sickeningly dull this film was possibly the slowest thing i ve ever watched imagine a doped up snail in space and really didn t do it for me the art was alright the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced i m not going to go into huge details about the storyline basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across for me i kind of wished that they would get gassed not because i m a horrible sadistic person but because the characters were uninspiring annoying dull and generally quite rude oh i m so terribly english i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film and it took a whole minutes or so before anything actually happened and even that was a terrible anticlimax if i were to praise it in any way i d have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well meaning maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy but the message it s trying to put forth is good in its nature the musical score was not bad too so to conclude this film is pretty poor i couldn t watch it the whole way through or i d probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom granted it isn t torque bad but it still doesn t rate highly in my eyes so i ve given it a hope this helps 
firstly i am not easily scared by anything except for my few phobias but this movie is absolutely horrific this is not appropriate for children at all i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i couldn t believe how gory it was for a children s movie bunnies being brutally murdered it s just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g i recommend being over to see this but don t get me wrong it was probably a good movie if i wasn t scarred mentally as a child i cannot believe a parent would allow a let s say year old child to watch this it s just to intense and complicated not to forget gory for young kids i m wayy over and i was shocked by the violence i don t recommend
so it s really sexist and classist and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change well he certainly changed his tune and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers the end of the movie does not make her a hero it makes the whole thing sad and its sad that people think it makes her a hero perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience yuck 
i should love this movie the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me the movie makes working class people look low and cheap the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it again the acting was very very good and worth watching i really don t like the story line just a personal preference thank you
the first half was ok but the last half really really disappointed it s funny the producers even admitted they didn t have a clue for the ending and it really showed whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this i really didn t want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn t really worth that effort when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake it didn t happen that first season border on being space porn they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama so i started watching again but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel same with baltar and six was pretty dumb 
there are many good things about the new bsg there s the multiple cylon roles for model and for example which the two actresses played superbly there s the old school feel of industrial design aboard galactica my ship will not be networked over my dead body also all the space battles the special effects even though the seasoned sci fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all the darkness of the characters their essentially flawed nature that makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish yes the first part the scenes in space the raid on the cylons and all that was very good but the mushy ending i always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden so i never know how much time is left until the end so for me it was a special kind of torture to see the end happen over and over again every time i thought oh this is the final scene the final shot i got one more every frakking character got its complete ending that wasn t really necessary what really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all the young roslin scenes why is important for us to know that a she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and b that she has a one night stand with a former pupil student what does that bring to the story where was the linkage now i m all for a more european ish style approach and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows and all that but this was just ridiculous this didn t bring anything meaningful to the story also i ve seen the last frakkin special and in it ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot he couldn t come up with a good ending for the story so he just didn t it s never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be the whole this was thousands of years in the past idea the mitochondrial eve thing was also used in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and believe you me there are a lot of bsg watchers who know that particular h g storyline and speaking of hera now there s a storyline that was not worked out well at all instead we get roslin is doing her former pupil who s years younger don t get me wrong i m all for older women with younger men the more power to them but this just made no sense all in all the writing in this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be that goes even moreso for the last episode i hope lost and do better with their series finales 
horrible ending and i can t believe moore spent a year coming up with it smacks of l ron hubbard and dianetitcs which hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first years now the first hours were action packed though absurd in the premise and then it deteriorated into a slow painful sophomoric dissolution of the series unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was were we to think more deeply if i wanted a lesson in a materialism i would reread daniel quinn s ishmael absurd to think k people would give up everything for a fresh start absurd to throw in a disappearing kara and a reappearing baltar and six absurd to throw in the mitochondrial eve just absurd 
did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak god was behind everything what has god got to do with sci fi god is only the answer when you can t think up a sensible explanation for something in fact this is exactly the problem with the series finale they obviously couldn t think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth why baltar has an imaginary in his head why has an imaginary baltar in her head etc so they explain it with angels or just don t explain it at all the plot of the last episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through for example why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl hera particularly after adama said there was no way he d attempt a rescue because they found out the location of the cylon base that s not a good reason to sacrifice the crew s lives and how did anders know the location and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters lives before the war it s like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread the word forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot the important message the writers wanted to get across is don t put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction god is your ultimate salvation tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no force instead a jedi actually gets his power from jesus then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks would this be a good ending no it frakken wouldn t 
the s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world with an emphasis on wild animals exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place and then bringing em back alive with the film footage such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features because there were no expensive sets costumes or high priced movie stars the most successful makers of such films artistically and financially were the team of martin e johnson and his wife osa who made several documentaries sometimes with blatantly staged events in africa and asia the johnsons safari films were extremely popular inspiring several parodies most notably wheeler woolsey s so this is africa in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs johnson martini instead of martin e johnson geddit although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time the johnsons films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour viewed from our own more enlightened i hope standpoint this is a serious flaw in the johnsons documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson ten years younger than her husband she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co produced with her husband congorilla is probably the best of the johnsons films the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting although these suffer from the johnsons penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look wild and alien the best and funniest scene in congorilla is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women the dance is the black bottom no less the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton the conjoined twins wearing jodhpurs riding boots and a pith helmet osa johnson starts scat singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women meanwhile they just stand there staring at her apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish it s a very funny scene but it has unpleasant undertones osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration using natural rhythm i guess because it s in their blood or something i ll rate congorilla points out of this film says a little bit about african life in the s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade 
the movie sucked it wasn t funny it wasn t exciting they tried to make it so bad that it would be good but failed and thinking it s cool to like this movie next to the hype are the only reasons that this movie is a success the fact that at this moment voted a out of for this movie seems pretty concerning to me either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes and should be dealt with anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising it s success can only be described as a marketing marvel 
i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started taking over the plane at first i thought maybe it should get a one for the comic relief but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that this movie isn t worth a trip to blockbuster be warned if you pay for it the only victim is your dumb ass if you want to be really scared i suggest the descent if you want humor go to your local stand up comedy club their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash 
all internet buzz aside this movie was god awful i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller horror movie and they completely missed there were only a few good parts and a couple good lines by samuel jackson other than that it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie now that the movie has actually come out hopefully this joke will die don t waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash if you re looking for something that s funny and entertaining then just go to snakes on a blog 
the only thing great about the movie is its title in this case snake on a plane is example of not judging the book by its cover the title says nothing about the movie when i went to the theater i wasn t expecting citizen kane i was expecting independence day a movie that s pure popcorn fun but instead i got that horrible roy liotta movie called turbulence yes this is how bad soap is the only thing make soap better is its title and it s not even the apporiate title for the movie the wasn t even a glimpse of snake or plane minutes into the movie what a false advertising if it wasn t for its title soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b grade summer movie and the r rating it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r all of the violence are kept pg level you know what s really r rated the r rated superstar edge see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake 
b movie at best sound effects are pretty good lame concept decent execution i suppose it s a rental you put some olive oil in your mouth to save you from de poison den you cut de bite and suck out de poisen you gonna be ok tommy you stay by the airphone when agent harris calls you get me give me a fire extinguisher weapons we need weapons where s the silverware all we have is this sporks dr price is the snake expert local ers can handle the occasional snakebite alert every er in the tri city area 
i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone s been fixing the score either way it was a real disappointment the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking wouldn t it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff and that s about it the plot is thin and unoriginal the snakes are bad cgi but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone the acting is poor and all people are unbelievable stereo types to sum it up it s one of the worst movies i ve ever seen stay away 
i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie rocked it is pure cg over acted crap don t send an assassin it s much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored aggressive venomous snakes on a plane the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to it is not so bad it s good it s so bad i d rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane a spoof was i wrong it s that whole it sucks get it or samuel a jackson yells snakes on the plane thing well i m sorry i don t get it it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung s cd still live in their mommies basement and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn then rush to the theater and ask for one since i doubt you have a girlfriend ticket for snakes on a stupid butt plane to hell with movies like full metal jacket pulp fiction true romance monkeys clerks etc there s no irony in watching good movies the true decline of the western civilization calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man or even orgazmo i ve said enough here 
i saw the p m showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back as i don t actually pay for movies anymore i didn t really find any redeeming qualities there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger in mind more than age as this film is rated r male audience the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well i know you all want to hear samuel l say his infamous line but let s be honest it s a whole lot of hype for very little pay off the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen now i am a reasonable man i knew going into the theater that i wasn t going to be seeing casablanka and i am at least thankful that this film is an original albiet inane idea and not some re make or franchise spin off however to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months 
when discussing a movie titled snakes on a plane we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy they crawl they slither these snakes do nothing of the sort they glide along like they would in a video game they are cartoon snakes i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures why not rely on suspense the whole less is more ethic or better still why not just make them look good in the first place and then maybe still use them sparingly take one look at john carpenters the thing here we have real slime and gore of eerie proportions years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap snakes on a plane when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee special effects are going backwards sure you could say but the movie is a joke get it sure i m with that idea but do it well in addition to the above this movie has crap dialogue and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way i could handle every other actor being part of this movie except for jackson what was he doing there the man who starred in pulp fiction years ago is this career progression are you offering people value for money no i d like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie the current generation seem to have very low expectations and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including doa dead or alive another cgi animal film called flushed away and another crap looking comedy named click in addition to that i saw some awful trailers including one for another crap british horror comedy i ve truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time expect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for in months time and if you re expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips forget it 
this film had so much promise i was very excited about this film in the end it was laughable at best painful at worst the acting styles ran the gamut from really really flat the angels the wife and daughter to over animated casper s character i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other pay special attention to the scene regarding the bug it s pretty much an insult to the audience s ability to figure things out in defense of that scene though it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations too bad they didn t make use of it i didn t feel like i was transported to exotic locations anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome however to end on a positive note i thought the sets were pretty good i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers it is my opinion and that s all it is that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased this film would have been good 
yes i admit i cried during this movie it was so incredibly disappointing that i couldn t help myself but cry tbn trinity broadcasting network has done it again first with having the million dollar man ex professional wrestler on their program and now this the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies it was quite amusing yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate the movie follows what is known as the bible code rather than following actual biblical scripture this film is extremely poorly made from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie i highly recommend you do not watch this movie even if your life depended on it 
 this movie basks too much in its own innocence it doesn t tell a story it s more a big time snooze fest while the actors are all personable the story is so trite and goes nowhere i think victor rasuk has great charisma but deserves a real film from a real storyteller 
quite honestly the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time during the first minutes i sat stunned in my seat trying to decide if i should demand a refund but since i hadn t paid to see it in the first place passes i figured i might as well stay and i didn t think it could possibly get any worse it did i will quickly run through the low points includes some spoilers the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane a motivational speaker with two phds the characterization was inconsistent for example lane despite his credentials is a complete nitwit then there s the lame o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code also terrible action sequences lane escapes from tough situations without explanation and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger it turns out to be a dream sequence that s cute for grammar school writing assignments but it s an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture the pacing was bad after a long opener the first third of the movie changes scenes every seconds later the pacing improves but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around and as someone else mentioned years pass yet no one not even lane s young daughter ages that was disconcerting there are a few good things though the quality of the film e g lack of graininess is high and very attractive the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism also there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god finally to help him this proved to be quite exhilarating even to me someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie unfortunately it was followed by major incomprehensibility the characters dialogue direction and acting were all poorly done michael ironside had nothing to do and michael york was just weird i think the producers wanted to do too much if the plot had been tighter and more focused and the characterization more fleshed out the film would have been far better in a nutshell the omega code disappoints definitely do not pay to see this i give it out of ten stars 
i m a christian i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians however as a rule they are know nothings when it comes to movie production i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen however they did a hideous job of it the acting was horrible and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong however in this critique those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into in short the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen and i would not recommend it to anyone except for comic relief from the every day grind 
i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of dominican movie industry the first minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do the movie falls becoming boring and not funny at all they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable i didn t like the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really disappointed i don t recommend this movie 
someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo gritty look is somehow seen as realistic by some people i didn t see anything realistic about the characters although the actors did their best with really bad parts or the situations instead i saw a forced self conscious effort at being edgy gritty and down and dirty sadly it takes a lot more than hand holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way it s a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies with bad cinematography non existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as art it s little wonder that films like in the bedroom or about schmidt get such raves i found them to be meandering and very average but compared to the current slew of independent clones like raising victor vargas they are outright brilliant and inspired a few years ago seeing an independent film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets nowadays it means that chances are you ll get yet another by the numbers let s shake the camera around for two hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them 
it has a great name but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money in fact the first mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone and yet the producers roberto angel salcedo calls him an actor but i don t think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting period the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it but they didn t and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad i don t buy it but hopefully this is as bad as it gets to make people accept those dvd s to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it that might work out maka
being an elvis fan i can t understand how this proyect could be done is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time totally unfunny silly and plenty of mistakes about the king come on elvis grave in a public park a mention about suspicious minds in and these are just two examples some people in the cast tries to do their best mike starr is funny specially as an impersonator the tom hanks cameo is a surprise but the guy playing the young elvis sucks overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute if you want to see an ultra cheap insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis i truly recommend you bubba ho tep instead of this mess 
darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman with odd ties to elvis presley running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevada and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own kim basinger a still attractive actress of considerable merit likes to pick quirky movies to play in but this dreadful screenplay by mitchell ganem and adam michael garber hasn t an iota of good humor the stereotypes and low ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy but even on a shambling shameful level the picture is crude and sloppy if you do watch see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac hands always in the same position and a non plussed look on her face hopefully both she and elvis were well paid no stars from 
i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if tom`s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child when i was a child i wasn`t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count judging by this film version of tom`s midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn`t have in the s so i guess there`s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere there`s also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source it`s inoffensive but i`m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were year olds who`d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy 
raising victor vargas a review you know raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big steaming bowl of oatmeal it s warm and gooey but you re not sure if it feels right try as i might no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didn t quite feel right victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director s part apparently the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof he was right but it didn t fool me raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeen year old boy called you guessed it victor vargas victor rasuk who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years they ve toured the movie starts off in `ugly fat donna s bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best friend harold kevin rivera comes a looking for him caught in the attempt by harold and his sister victor vargas runs off for damage control yet even with the embarrassing implication that he s been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat on a hot new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victor s eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy judy marte who s not just pretty but a strong and independent too the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film the story also focuses on victor s family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita altagracia guzman his brother nino also played by real life brother to victor silvestre rasuk and his sister vicky krystal rodriguez the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp daddy his feelings for judy and his grandmother s conservative catholic upbringing the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few but glaring errors throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky nino grandma judy and even judy s best friend melonie the problem is we know nothing of victor vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood we know that he knows how to lick his lips and comb his fro and carry himself for the sake of wooing girls into the sack but that s all we know that nino plays piano and quiet well you could see it by the awards on the family piano we know his sister nicki is a gossip loving girl with an invested interest in watching tv we know that grandma is a hard working traditional latina woman who s trying to raise her kids with conservatively in a world of excess corruption yet where is the titular character victor vargas he s in this movie somewhere but we only know what the movie tells us this is by far the film s biggest flaw victor vargas isn t so much a character but a ping pong ball bouncing between scenes with judy and his grandmother but we never get to know who victor vargas really is this is important because as i ve mentioned the only thing we know of victor vargas is that he s a sexually active teenager with a libido the size of manhattan he s a total alpha male victor vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all why should anyone so by the end of the movie in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow victor vargas has attained any depth and learned the errors of his ways how could such a two dimensional character have any depth if only the director had worried a little more about fleshing out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand held shot raising victor vargas brings to life the world of the latino inner city neighborhood to the big screen something that few films have done before in the past the film has been complimented for feeling so real and i won t argue with that i haven t seen this level of reality since cbs aired survivor seriously although the movie has some nice shots of the city the writer director peter sollett was way too dependent on close ups and hand held shots this problem is particularly noticed in indoor scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep breathing exercises to keep from passing out as the film continues the shots get tighter and tighter with faces cropped from brow to chin on the screen you can practically smell victor vargas s cheap cologne the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast the indoor scenes of inner city apartments make them look small and cramp which is not true i ve been in those type apartments i used to live in one they re not splendorous but they have high ceilings and they re decent living spaces by the movie s standards you d think that these apartments were x cells of brick and mortar chipped paint and cracked walls unfortunately sollett s constant use of close ups and one particularly bad shot with a zoom in on one scene come off as totally amateurish but raising victor vargas is only sollett s second film and his most well known a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films one review i read summarized the movie as `ethnicity for ethnicity s sake and i cannot agree more if victor vargas were truly a great film and story then the characters applicability wouldn t matter whether they were latino chinese etc yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle class suburbia with a bunch of teeny bopper white kids the results wouldn t be such glowing reviews and we d see the film s flaws more clearly indeed some other aspects of the use of latinos in this film bother me while some aspects of victor vargas are accurate others i have to question for example victor nino and vicky all share the same room to sleep this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe any self respecting latino family wouldn t have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen year old girl at first i was unsure perhaps i was wrong but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified considering how conservative the grandmother is you d think that vicky would have been sleeping in her room as a latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative cuban household raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full time i could relate to the movie in many ways which is why my critical viewpoints are bittersweet because i really wanted to love this movie unfortunately my lack of respect for victor vargas sabotaged my feelings for the film maybe it s because victor vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my sega genesis when i was seventeen maybe it s because without any further introspection by the film victor vargas is merely a stereotypical hot blooded latino who ll just end up shouting to girls from his car `hey bay bee ju want to get into my luv mah cheen either way i don t like him so ultimately how can i like a film about him so if you ll excuse me i m going to go stick my hands into a bowl of grits 
i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy i know i wouldn t have the nerve to go even feet away from a croc but everything in this movie is bad farting jokes people getting eaten and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time it s a really bad film that you have to stay away from all the jokes are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is years old i m surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this 
gday mates just watched croc hunter the movie it was alright but the show seems more real this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier lines and more characters a few things steve described snakes fangs like hypodermic needles yeeeowch for reals you know that hurts and cant they jump up high hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff there was two major cleavage shots in this movie when terry find that baby joey she goes like we have to nurture them just like a baby woah i thought she was gonna up breast feed that kid that woulda made it pg though while on terry did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry s knowledge on ritual mating she knows her sex stuffs movie takes place in queensland austrailia i want a koala dingo and joey steve s dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite wielding hottie oh and if anyone else watches this try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in shotgunning the croc he was eating her sheep i would be mad too 
so steve irwin you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs snakes lizards tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles and mud not only daily but with enthusiasm he was never able to make me want to do it but he managed to make his wife come close this movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category the films for people who just had their teeth drilled have a migraine or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity currently well populated by disney films it s too noisy well steve is too noisy he s just so happy all the time and would cut right through the blas teenager i can hear it now that movie was so stupid or the tylenol with codeine i d say his enthusiasm is catching but if it was i would own a room full of snakes and that hasn t happened yet i agreed they re beauties but i m still not going to pet them plot was indeed predictable bad guys were so bad for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore but the movie was filled with animals and steve and terri which is why i watched it that plot if you could call it that was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck my expectations were low and stayed that way i was hoping though that there would be a bit of a sequel where steve and terri having worked on their acting skills have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur i still can t believe we won t see steve anymore i hope that terri and the children continue to be involved in the australia zoo and the discovery channel at least i can t imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is crikey 
i caught this at a test screening all i can say is what the hell this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for scarface it s bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car the film is still so bizarre that it isn t even funny the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to save a crocodile which contains a cia probe the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back irwin mistakes them for poachers and sets out to stop them that s about all the story there is the rest is over the top lampooning of australian culture didja see dat and crikey and strangely choreographed action sequences at one point irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it yes that s right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film 
ok first of all steve irwin rest in peace you were loved by many fans now this movie wasn t a movie at all it was the crocodile hunter tv program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals he was entertaining as an animal seeker specialist millions will miss him but the whole movie idea was a big mistake the plot was so broken it was almost non existent casting was horrible the acting wasn t even worth elementary school level actors the direction must be faulted as well if you can t get a half way decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place i could have written a better script i wish i had never been to see this movie of course i watched it for for me for my son while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action my son who is not so discriminating liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again if you want fond memories of steve irwin buy his series on dvd avoid this movie like the plague if i were steve i know i wouldn t want to be remembered for this movie respect him avoid this movie 
this movie has a very broadway feel the backdrop the acting the noise and yet that s all it has some sense of a broadway without the bang the movie is slow paced the picture disjointed the singing pops up on you so that you suddenly are reminded it s a musical disappointing sinatra intolerable sinatra s fianc surely the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary tolerable mr i remember the numbers on my dice delight brando s understated singing very biased surprise how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes it s the bone structure how i would ve killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again 
en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway a female reporter runs into a strange hitch hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman s husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthology a nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short and that s not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy with joe haggerty as the tale telling ebenezer jackson giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen the locations are uninspired the script is dreary there s a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending well that beggars belief to be fair some of sykes creative camera work is effective although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused and joe castro s cheapo gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation these positives just about make the film bearable but be warned the zombie chronicles ain t a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of z grade trash i give the zombie chronicles but generously raise my rating to since i didn t get to view the film with the benefit of d although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn t have made that much of a difference 
i never was an avid viewer of crocodile hunter but did occasionally see an episode or a bit of an episode and when the news spread about steve irwin s death from a stingray attack in it certainly caught my attention this movie with steve and his wife terri playing themselves but in a fictional story was released in but i didn t hear of it until several years later and even after that it took me a while to get around to seeing it well now i have seen it and after looking here first more than once and seeing its rating i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be though it could have been a bit better apparently it s supposed to be a comedy so a major problem with it is that it isn t very funny at all a u s satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia where it is swallowed by a crocodile while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt and are unaware of what s inside it two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon the agents are assisted by jo buckley and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them on steve and terri s mission they face other types of dangerous wildlife not just the crocodile and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it when steve sees the cia agents after them he mistakes them for poachers not only did i not laugh once while watching this film the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents apart from that i don t think i found anything even mildly amusing it s also a bit of an incoherent mess switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters and it seems like clips from crocodile hunter and clips from an action thriller or something like that put together for some reason also added to that mix are the ranch scenes which also seem to be from somewhere else and as funny as brozzie drewitt played by magda szubanski is supposed to be she s not at one point we see her farting so we have a fart joke a major clich in modern comedy are they so hard to resist i also found the typical crocodile hunter scenes with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers to be tedious but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didn t help steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist and is sadly missed by them while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him no matter which side you re on the crocodile hunter collision course is not a well crafted movie i m sure it does help if you re a big steve irwin fan but even if you are there s no guarantee that you would like this movie as some fans clearly haven t been impressed in fact it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have so maybe it won t help like i said there s no guarantee i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show this movie was unnecessary the attempt to combine what is usually seen in crocodile hunter with a fictional story unfortunately failed and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes 
i saw this film yesterday i rented the dvd from blockbuster in fact i know one of the actresses from the film i won t say who that s kept under wraps but i must admit it wasn t as good as i thought it would be tom savini hats down to this guy but it s a shame he wasn t in the film for long what lacks the film is the idea the script sound etc it may look like a good movie but it wasn t that entertaining well i m glad my sister paid for renting dvd s from blockbuster i chose this one and i was disappointed anyway thumbs down for me not my cup of tea out of 
if you liked blair with you ll like this one it has the same lousy camera work and soundtrack and it has the same non existent plot and suspenseful moments it also has tom savini so if you like romero s dawn of the dead or tarantino and rodriguez from dusk till dawn you re in for a treat he is an icon and a very good actor as well no seriously this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i ve seen in a long time and i ve seen quite a few movies bad ones as well i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect but this was just a pure waste of time the only reason why i gave this movie instead of was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp looking plastic teeth no i m just kidding i must have missed before i hit submit on the vote form stay away even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover 
when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clich s that you can guarantee will follow the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens what who how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst the van will break down whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about they will find a house inhabited by a madman he will capture them the house will have a phone but it will not work it will be disturbingly decorated there will be flickering neon light spiders and maggots the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won t start here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap weak scare and will then be killed properly only a girl will be left alive from the group there will be an unnecessary twist at the end add to these elements naked sirens who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately that seduce and kill the teens throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film darkhunters which is one of the worst films i have ever seen at times the cinematography is very good the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity however the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again but amongst the dvd extras if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director s commentary it is beyond belief there is more to say about this than the film itself one staggering part of the commentary is the director s claim that the film is clich leaden because it was a preconceived idea he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clich s and openly he wonders if people will get it i m afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clich s within them then it is not wittily scripted enough acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question what was the point this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies any attempt to do something clever or different haven t worked the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use however the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary there is a simple distinction to be made here mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant the best moment is reserved for robert s comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film those who didn t like it are generalised as geeks and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn t singled out for ridicule the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers complete with hilarious accents to imply that people from norway wouldn t know a good film simply because of where they are born as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast robert s swears blind in voice over i didn t want to make a film that was like baywatch as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground there is also a simpering self indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert s says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is the best british film in years i don t know who he is trying to convince at one point in the commentary track robert s says jokingly i can see people sitting at home saying this isn t amazing its sh t he isn t wrong 
booted out of heaven a gang of horny naked female angels with big plastic fangs have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by it s not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes an independent low budget horror made in the uk forest of the damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting effects and direction i have seen in a long time director johannes roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled shock moments but for the most part the film is technically amateurish throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons tom savini and shaun hutson and you have one real bad movie on your hands some fun may be derived from the film s sheer shoddiness and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour but most will find this a chore to sit through 
nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc but the heat is on and he can t find a secure location he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can t make a prim missionary sarah brown go out to dinner with him sky takes up the challenge but both men have some surprises in store this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour with big sets loud music larger than life roles and performances to match broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing which i don t my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music i like all kinds of music from albinoni to zz top but broadway show tunes in swing time with never ending pah pah tah dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren t my cup of tea this was written by the tag team of frank loesser mankiewicz jo swerling and abe burrows based on a couple of damon runyon stories and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak blaine s two numbers for example are identical unnecessary don t advance the plot and grate on the ears and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you there are only two memorable tunes luck be a lady sung by brando not sinatra as you might expect and sit down you re rockin the boat nicely performed by kaye but you have to sit through two hours to get to them the movie s trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful laid back performance he also sings quite well and even dances a little and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise bustle and vowel murdering of noo yawk fans of musicals may dig this but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show 
note to horror fans the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted minutes of your life on a movie that s so worthless it s insulting i watched this because the premise sounded slightly promising it s not it s just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low budget slasher films that weren t good either the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful it s not it s so not the amateur cinematography makes sure the fallen angels are about as sexy as the average homeless person the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre he s the king of low budget special effects and lower budget acting come to think of it savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie it s not that he s bad but he s almost always in bad movies his only good role was in from dusk till dawn and he s been milking that at horror conventions ever since but let s focus on the positive forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie everything else is a negative obviously the writer is allergic to originality the script is terrible that s all a given after the first minutes but the clueless pacing the way the director treats plot and characterization as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway and the excruciatingly long and boring driving walking and nature sequences no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general this is another good example of the number one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad if it s written and directed by the same person expect garbage 
oh boy where do i go with this one herendous acting weak plot stupid deaths pointless nudity this isn t entertainment this is hell hell don t waste your money time or life on this pit of evil it s just god damn is this movie awful tom savini why why would you waste your life on this crap this movie not worth it i d rather snort crack and smash my head up against a wall than watch this this sinful act again please take my advice and stay the f k away from this elephant turd of a film no you know what i shouldn t even have to call this thing a film just stay away 
though frank loesser s songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer they re bollixed by joseph l mankiewicz lethargic staging and uninspired presentation when it s over it barely feels like you ve watched a musical mankiewicz doesn t seem to know how to present loesser s challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect for example one of the best numbers the showstopping `adelaide s lament concludes by having adelaide vivian blaine belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge and stubby kaye s faux spiritual `sit down you re rockin the boat has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue adapted from abe burrows stage book has none of the wit that his films like `all about eve have part of the blame has to go to the leads just about all of whom are miscast marlon brando looks bewildered as to why he s in a musical frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential the songs are not tailored to his style and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might only blaine as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide commands our attention like a broadway pro should the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets 
angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now reside in a british forest where they seduce and chop up teens talk about high concept on the plus side this little mother gives us tom savini but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen time his five minute presence seems a tad long the angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie but though they might have the body of an angel their faces sure look like joan rivers on a bad day mediocre acting and amateurish gore effects don t help and the night scenes fatally recall paris hilton s most famous movie so bad that it is really bad 
this movie is a terrible waste of time although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose this is also a horror film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight my friend and i laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared the only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries it cannot be that high in demand the supermodel nicole petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie half of the time she is british and half the time she is american 
this film actually works from a fairly original idea i ve never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway however the way that it executes this idea isn t original in the slightest we follow a bunch of kids that for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest the fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecks nutcases zombies etc but really the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme many films of this ilk don t have a single good idea and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one the only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they re beautiful women that the characters lust for rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from this is good up until a point but it soon gets boring and the almost complete lack of any back story surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the horror trash category it s been years since the evil dead made the woodlands a prime horror location and in spite of films like the blair witch project it still makes for an excellent horror setting this is one of the film s major assets as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown the only problem is that forest of the damned doesn t ever seem to have much up its sleeve the death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination and the fact that all the characters are clich d in the extreme doesn t help as you re more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away the cast is made up of kids mainly but there is a role here for tom savini who unfortunately doesn t get to have fun in the special effects department the only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves the naked ladies tend to look great and if it wasn t for them this film would get very boring very quickly there s nothing to recommend this film for really but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks you might find some enjoyment here 
for the first forty minutes empire really shapes itself up it appears to be a strong confident and relatively unknown gangster flick at the time i didn t know why i thought it was good but now i do one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful i don t mind films with psychos and things to prove a point take jackie brown for example but they re all so terribly shallow in this but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach another major problem is the protagonist he is smug arrogant yet ironically enough not that bad he doesn t seem tight enough to be a drug dealing woman killer the fact is at the end of the day this film is completely pretentious not slick not clever just dull and meaningless this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs out of out of 
i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop s and this one surely is an oop one year after the exorcist she s back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out she never became a mega star that s one of the reason s many of her films are oop she gives a good performance in this movie it s about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn t have any friends played at an age of playing a girl of that s funny the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity in most editions it s cut out why i don t know no blood is involved okay blair is butt naked but nothing is shown no t a so nothing to offend people but the movie is slow extremely slow it doesn t happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep it s just about that year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows no gore no nothing why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me if you re a fan of blair buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is 
 this review may have spoilers but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well known story the cinderella story ranks as my favorite fairy tale the world will never have enough of this wonderful tale the problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale this cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing this cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never hatches or rather is never transformed into a swan all the production value that money can buy cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development or good acting the entrance of cinderella at the ball as so poorly done there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery the writing made me very nervous too the prince charming was the most undesirable of memory why would any girl want to marry a boorish self absorbed prince who disliked women turner s turn on the stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one liners more than acting nuance even the cinderella part held little interest or sympathy perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt so cheaply s what must be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography matte work and production design it was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes sets and settings as the story unfolded for some cinderella storytelling go for two gems rodgers and hammerstein s cinderella musical with lesley ann warren even with the obvious stagey tv s look to the sets this is the best version on celluloid bar none an all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment engaging diverting and memorable writing and music this is the classic ever after this drew barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale the characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well 
disappointing musical version of margaret landon s anna and the king of siam itself filmed in with irene dunne and rex harrison has deborah kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from england to siam in to accept job as tutor to the king s many children and perhaps teach the royal one a thing or two in the process stagy picture begins well but quickly loses energy and focus yul brynner reprising his stage triumph as the king is a commanding presence but is used per the concocted story as a buffoon kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better despite having to lip synch to marni nixon s vocals perhaps having already played this part to death brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast second half with anna and the moppets staging a musical version of uncle tom s cabin is quite ridiculous and the rodgers and hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering brynner won a best actor oscar but it is feisty kerr who keeps this bauble above water overlong heavy and old fashioned in the worst sense of the term from 
madison is not too bad if you like simplistic non offensive family friendly fare and more importantly if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing if like me you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like musson muncey cantrell slovak etc prepare to be disappointed professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports clich in the book i needn t repeat what they ve said what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the glory years which many would argue were already past in yes it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast though it was clear that the restored versions hats off to the volunteers at the hydroplane and race boat museum were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed but where was the sound much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind numbing roar of six allison or rolls merlin aircraft engines wound up to rpm s never imagined by their designers hitting the starting line right in front of you you didn t hear it you felt it real hydro buffs know exactly what i m talking about there s none of that in madison instead every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a heroic musical score and then there are the close up shots of the drivers riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home town hero or in one particularly ridiculous shot taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a rocky salute from a bridge pier in reality some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock hard water at speeds above mph as one reviewer so aptly put it the sport deserves better than this finally since another user brought up anachronisms i ll add one the establishing shot of seattle shows the kingdome and safeco field neither existed in 
this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problems with this play to begin with but first the movie it s a typical tv movie version of a play which means it doesn t have the flair of the original film version with william holden what they couldn t afford to hire more than twelve people as extras why move the movie up to so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war protests why not and give her a line about the civil rights movement as for the casting some hits some misses jay o sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with josh brolin brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes he s believable as an ex bmoc jock but he doesn t have the raw sensuality of william holden i always thought brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him pardon the pun gretchen moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played she didn t project the innocence or ignorance that the character required maybe it s because she and brolin were about years older than the characters should be but then again holden was ten years too old bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and mary steenburgen can t seem to make up her mind whether she was playing blanche dubois or katharine from the taming of the shrew as for mr inge s play i always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue the twilight zone i believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode spur of the moment where a young diana hyland was being chased by a bitter older diana hyland because the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter 
perhaps it s because i am so in love with the william holden kim novak version or because i m not a gen x er but this was absolutely the worst remake i have ever seen without the original s soundtrack it just seemed like another typical tv movie yes about as bland as kraft cheese 
 according to reviewers the year is and the players are year old college kids about to enter grad school jolly joke the synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet but there it is on the bandstand the ford pony car was not invented yet but there it is playing oldies music the synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid s the pony car at best is from the mid s year old college kids josh brolin had seen birthdays when this made for tv movie was produced the plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their tv s 
william cooke and paul talbot share director writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth and a scroungy town tramp named ralph gunnar hansen of leatherface fame wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire one tale is the old retread of the hook two teens on lover s lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s t as they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas who can t wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus the fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies without a big budget for special effects campfire tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse a bit corny but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale the acting is understandably not award worthy cast members include tres holton courtney ballard h ray york johnny tamblyn walter kaufmann kevin draine david avin and paul kaufmann 
well what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation there are some amazing actors in this oliver reed sarah miles christopher plummer but they clearly are clocking up the money lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics anthony with hugh grant who looks suitably embarrassed and gilbert with helena bonham carter if you really want to see a watchable adaptation of cartland the bonham carter one is the one to go for a hazard of hearts what a title gilbert is the weak link in that but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek edward fox diana rigg 
bizarre take on the cinderella tale terribly poor script but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step mother performance visually stunning in some parts but that s about it the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the s fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full minutes of drivel if you re really in the mood for a cinderella story i suggest ever after a cinderella story or the glass slipper 
when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie it s touch and go whether you should revisit it anyway i remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by jeff kober the first power is not a very good movie sad to say it s chock full of those cop clich s and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through along with countless convenient twists that help the story run along lou diamond phillips is the over confident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case ahhh this is trash but enjoyable as such especially if you have fond memories of it it scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good as for any kind of logic here forget it just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a s demonic flick and who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillips in the lead here needless to say he s not convincing at all but he tries his best and i ve never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have as for tracy griffith as the psychic the less said the better but kober is pretty good as the killer always liked that actor the first power may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day s work and a brain switch off is needed beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and i ll definitely have loads of it the next time i give this movie a spin all in all not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids see you around buddy boy 
 i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program and i thought it was awful as i said in my tagline it was pretentious trite petty and phenomenally self important i consider myself a fan of film and all the things that film has to offer if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival i will watch a e and they would probably be alot more objective about it i dont recommend it period 
i don t remember a movie where i have cared less about where the characters have come from what happens to them or where they are going i realize that hollywood s greatest pastime is navel gazing but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with for what it s worth though the discussion that followed the showing under the auspices of the key sunday cinema series did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics i disagree 
awful awful awful no i didn t like it it was obvious what the intent of the film was to track the wheeling and dealing of the movers and shakers who produce a film in some cases these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are i didn t need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are i suppose i m at fault really because i expected something like roman holiday i m not a movie maker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of two shots in the main where the actors had been supplied with a loose plot line and they were to improvise the dialogue henry jaglon makes the claim that he along with victoria foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors cognisant of the general direction of the film extemporised the dialogue and it was not always successful such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didn t flow along the line of the conversation and i m not going back to look for it and greta scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation because silver s remark was such a non sequitur you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to wrong foot the other actor and break his her concentration another instance of this is when a producer tells silver to bring the ^ documents times silver looked literally lost for words i have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful too the fact that jaglon was able to attract greta scacchi no stranger to australia ron silver anouk ami and maximilian schell suggests it was a slow news week for them peter bogdanovich had a what the hell am i doing here look on his face at all times and i expected to hear him say look i m a director and screenwriter not an actor which would have been unnecessary to state faye dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son liam apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue the hand held camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude as i suspect the natural dialogue was and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot that at least approached cinema verite so that along with the irritating french singing during which i used the mute button made for a generally disappointing odd minutes i think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided there was really nothing avant garde about it it didn t come across as a work of art and yet it wasn t a documentary either i know it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining i was bored out of my skull it did have one redeeming feature it pronounced cannes correctly so i gave it 
movie industry is tricky business because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life too that s the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an insightful film about film and indeed no better proof of the industry s trickiness than seeing anouk aim e and maximilian schell trapped in this inanity the insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like should i make a studio movie that pays a lot or should i make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self do the latter please or our relationship is not only professional it s private as well it s a rather complex situation to handle isn t it yes it is my dear between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees hotel lobbies and american movie posters no sign of non american film presence on the croisette recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable making the minutes of the film feel like ages jenny gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame 
rural family drama with perhaps a nod to ordinary people concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap despite downbeat subject matter given mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring unfortunately the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience what with robert duvall glenn close and wilford brimley in the cast the movie is nearly a small scaled reunion of the natural too bad this project didn t get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping memorable picture from 
after being a big fan of the ten minute t v episodes of stella street i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t v episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing as if the actors had said them once and couldn t be bothered to say them again i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again spoilers the plot of the film starts with stella street a normal english street in surrey gradually being populated by some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years including michael caine al pacino jack nicholson and the rolling stones all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people there are some nice moments but on the whole the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring end of spoilers in the t v episodes all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell including females but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast i think this was a mistake her impersonations weren t funny and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street you may find this film entertaining but if you were a fan i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated 
apparently the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood i use the word apparently because without listening to a director andy copp s commentary which i didn t have available to me or reading up on the film prior to watching viewers won t have a clue what it is about gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real life footage but unless they re also fond of pretentious headache inducing experimental art house cinema they ll find this one a real chore to sit through minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis chordant sound terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue this mind numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one s sanity if you ve still got all your marbles you ll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead i watched the whole thing but am well aware that i m completely barking 
this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production poor film making aside the story is vile just sick evil sh t if you like rape murder and self harm this is right up your alley and if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen someones brains blown out never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty 
this is a good example of how not to make a film there is very little meaningful dialog no context for the events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes the result is a confused clueless viewer the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director s commentary this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is with an emphasis on child abuse it includes some stock footage of real horrible acts of violence including war time executions although it works in the context of the movie i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors the climax is anti climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie if you re not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it the director s commentary was a one shot sit the guy down and let him talk no cuts type of commentary while this isn t necessarily bad the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college filming conditions co producers bad film and a dozen other things the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie the movie was shot many years ago on mm and super film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget because of this the video and audio quality is poor that alone does not make it a bad movie but it does make a bad movie worse 
it s a hideous little production apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches it s an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop motion animation it s weird but it s not the kind of fun weird trip anyone optimistic might expect it s the cold inhuman unfriendly sickening even creepy kind of weird there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie after all disney did a fantastic job with the same source material and cosgrove hall did far more attractive things with stop motion interestingly this is a french production as such it re enforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary 
i don t know why this has the fans it does and i don t know why i have even given it the score i have this is preposterous there are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen but this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack even by italian standards not a giallo this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring klaus kinski in one his most blatant phoned in performances i reckon he turned up did a day s work and cleared off leaving mr d amato to get others to fill in ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle maybe i just wasn t in the right mood 
 i don t understand none of this makes any sense exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of death smiles at murder having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie i know exactly how he feels the story by the film s director aristide massacessi good old joe d amato using his real name for a change is a clumsy mix of the supernatural murder mystery and pretentious arty rubbish the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy s garbage such as jess franco s more bizarre efforts but which had me struggling to remain conscious opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister with whom he had been having an incestuous affair before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman played by ewa aulin who stars in the equally strange death laid an egg is seen alive and kicking the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbr ck after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home where she is tended to by creepy dr sturges klaus kinski in a throwaway role the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr and mrs ravensbr ck meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin so far so good i thought to myself at this point we ve had hunchbacks incest some blood and guts and gratuitous female nudity all ingredients of a great trashy euro horror what follows however is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings ghostly goings on and even elements from edgar allan poe s the black cat to tell a very silly utterly bewildering and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb but given the choice i would much rather watch one of the director s sleazier movies from later in his career i guess incomprehensible meandering surreal s gothic horror just ain t my thing out of purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness rounded up to for imdb 
i saw this movie in its own time period when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life but stamped your child as a bastard in these days of single mothers that may seem very far fetched but it was very true and i m not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering either between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny at that time i didn t know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had i did know who betty hutton was and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic i loved bringing up baby but i find this movie just embarrassing i m sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to get married and get pregnant just added to the misery an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part of course shoot me i don t like it s a wonderful life either 
this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid chase scenes are uniformly boring and most of the on screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film s last five minutes a briefly glimpsed port a potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film s chief villain no prop is here without a purpose the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger corman s studio when he d give a first time director a few bucks and a camera but without the discipline corman would impose 
you can give jms and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget but the movie is still sub par dont get me wrong b the series is by far the best tv series ever but if i was an exec seeing this movie i wouldnt have ordered the series i dont like o hare as an actor the costumes are silly and there are tons of cliches the same can be said for most of the first season with the exception of babylon squared and survivors bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle if you are a b fan and havent seen this movie see it if you arent a b fan dont you wont want to watch the series 
i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission and let me tell you you ll watch anything under those circumstances not this piece of sh t though the first five minutes set the tone by weak porn movie quality acting weird out of the blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior it gets worse after that this movie does not have one single saving grace and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch it s just horrible i ve seen quite many movies in my life and i m not one of those snobby know all critics i mean i ll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they re bad this one man steer _well_ clear of this one my friend 
my wife is a fanatic as regards this show that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy embrace of the vampire to name a few the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals i ve seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don t know if it was their own choosing or not please please don t renew for another season as enough is enough bob
 slight spoilers a hunchback year old boy kisses a very cute year old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time after the act he lays in the bed with her not touching her the next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years this is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality or perhaps a medical drama about a post pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency however as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a year old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother at one point his mother preaches to her co workers who are not as understanding as they might be every step of the way in this my son has been amazing i have never been more proud of him the young father s older sister who otherwise is cold towards her brother begins to show pride in her sibling you have been cool about this as she gives him an encouraging warm hug the year old father wants to be a father he wants to be a parent why not we see the new baby a few minutes after birth it appears to be a healthy happy month old infant just as babies were born on tv in the s and s once the young father is a parent he has found happiness he insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper we see the year old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen s busy body mother is peaking over his shoulder fade to black 
with the exception of family this new season is worse than season one i can t imagine what they are thinking as a fan of horror can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem but this series gets worse with each outing i can t imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day toiling to churn out such crap story is that too much to ask for character how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories if we are not engaged who cares if they get carved up or whatever almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting even dante s effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion ironically the production values and performances tend to be up to speed while the content is utter crap i have great hopes for exec producer s garris s valarie under the stairs but we shall see 
i was very excited when this series premiered in the premise was very simple and appealing each episode would be a one hour mini movie directed by a famous noteworthy horror director then when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown some good episodes emerged from that first season but all in all it was a mixed bag i attributed it to the learning curve and figured that season would be a whole lot better boy was i in for a shock at least season one had a few good stories here and there season with the exception of the black cat starring the excellent jeffrey combs was a complete and total loss to me the episode sounds like may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last years and most of the other episodes aren t much better i really hope that season turns this around next year but i m not holding my breath 
according to imdb takashi miike s master of horror segment imprint was banned in the us so i figured i d translate the swedish review i just wrote for it it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killer director takashi miike s episode in the masters of horror series and the dvd cover of imprint did in deed look very promising the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello some time during the th century and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey it turns out that one of the prostitutes a deformed and quiet girl know about komomo and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent american english but i will leave it at that it s not that big a deal what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was miike s tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldn t help looking at my watch several times during the minutes the extended torure scene that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie felt so unmotivated and pornographically intrusive that not even that scene became interesting i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself with no sense of style or purpose the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water and in all honesty the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago for me most memorable as frank nitti al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables i ve always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy and i mean that in a good way and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible not in a good way in this one his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago i m grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh memoirs of a geisha who plays the deformed prostitute the finale is probably supposed to be chocking maybe even revolting and horrid but i just found it to be kind of you know blah and i looked at my watch again for the umptieth time just wishing the crappy episode would end maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit but that s only because i couldn t help thinking of an episode of red dwarf and the upside down chins of craig charles and danny john jules with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens lucky you if you ve seen that episode and now decide to see imprint i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you my first thought when imprint finally ended was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it was hearing the main title theme by edward shearmur the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series and that if anything is a big friggin warning don t you think one might point to the costume design by michiko kitamura and say that there at least is something not lacking in style and refinement but there are so many other films and tv shows that is so much better at showing off the japanese geisha fashion this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed takashi miike s masters of horror episode is boring uninspiring and pointless in other words it s really really bad 
i m sorry i had high hopes for this movie unfortunately it was too long too thin and too weak to hold my attention when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream i felt cheated surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper something more meaningful so don t buy a large drink or you ll be running to the rest room my kids didn t enjoy it either ah well 
i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap i had wanted to see it for ages finding the plot outline very intriguing so my disappointment was great to say the least i thought the lead actor was very flat this kind of part required a performance like johny depp s in the ninth gate of which this is almost a complete rip off but i guess tv budgets don t always stretch to this kind of acting ability i also the thought the direction was confused and dull serving only to remind me that carpenter hasn t done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness as for the story well i was disappointed there as well there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor and the way he finally got the film anti climactic to say the least this was written by one of the main contributors to aicn and you can tell he does love his cinema but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise i took the dvd back to the store the same day 
the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out i have actually seen better acting in low budget porn i though i had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene jim watch your ass nick you watch yours together i wont leave you behind the first action sequence shows how awful the production is but its really kind of funny good guys have transformer weapons in one scene they all have fake hk mp sub machine guns next scene ak replicas and then to top it all off they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of m s i think they had a budget shortage for guns not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell you have to remove the pin spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own you can t fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter weapons that you throw away don t suddenly re appear when a gun is out of bullets throwing it away is still pretty stupid unless you have no idea how to reload them big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes i really cant believe movies like this are actually produced this movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk 
early heavy war time propaganda short urging people to be careful with their spending practices in effort to prevent any runaway inflation using scare guilt and patriotic jingoistic rhetoric which was normal for the time the government was concern that the sudden war time production and therefore wage increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the war it truly is a window into the past historically and culturally 
this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline the problem is frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l paul bremer in to tell his side of the story more troubling is the fact that the director of the film charles ferguson a former think tank wonk was a war supporter until the occupation went south what did he think would happen the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis and that is what this film feels like an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better as if any war can be better 
this movie was so bad that my i q went down about points after seeing it it made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it it must of been some kind of personal favor to van damme 
universal soldier the return is not the worst movie ever made no that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner however perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier the return this film is a sci fi action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it the acting is as bad as any movie i ve ever seen the plot is terrible and predictable the special effects are pathetic in short anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves us the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces some movies are so bad they re good believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them i m really not sure what else to say here i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn t already but just in case don t 
no fireworks despite violent action science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention and unfortunately for its producers this work is lacking on both counts woefully so in the case of the latter with essentially no budget with which to operate it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and in particular special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish while seeds from the scriptors imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility the plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to earth with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first timer paolo mazzucato whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus 
this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie cheap looking and worst of all boring action scenes the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence only minutes but it feels like it goes on forever even die hard van damme fans like myself should avoid this one 
we open with colonel luc deveraux van damme the original universal soldier and his buxom asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be universal soldiers they almost kill the two then oh wait it was just a field test deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of universal soldiers why he would want to be involved in this if you know anything about the original is never explained and well beyond me it s after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going the united states government has cut the universal soldier s project budget and in the process angered seth the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the universal soldiers naturally he won t be shut down without a fight so that means van damme has to go around and take all the new breed of universal soldiers out which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel but that doesn t stop it from becoming stupid as hell for instance one of the new universal soldiers is played by bill goldberg seems you can t go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie he s big he s tough right wrong van damme doesn t seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him once twice three times the point here lost on me then there s the breaking of glass a rudimentary part of any action movie but someone involved must have a glass fetish you have to see the fight scenes in particular let s not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck they have seth the computer secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black michael jai white nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem potentially offensive and just downright lame he s no replacement for dolph either universal soldier is a lousy sequel it s loud it s dumb and it doesn t care the original wasn t anything poetic but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level the sequel doesn t they do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence so give credit where credit is due 
the infamous ed wood classic plan from outer space features an indignant alien calling the human race stupid stupid stupid stupid i d have to say exhibit a in that trial would probably this movie a ridiculously silly sci fi film falling action star jean claude van damme returns to a hit role for him from the original movie luke a former universal soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers while van damme was too big to reprise the role in the first two sequels he was too small to do much of anything else by the time the fourth film in the universal soldier series came around so probably cursing under his breath the whole way he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks you ll find plenty of mindless violence but i d advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing otherwise you are liable to forget where you left it by the time it s over luke is called into action against more universal soldiers after a really really really evil computer named seth makes hal look like ghandi turns all the other universal soldiers into evil remorseless killers of course this is what these things are programmed to do but in this case they are killing their creators not the enemy so that s a problem i love the dumb logic of this movie logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as michael jai white does to be in this movie logic that dictates that the creator of seth be a blue haired cyber stereotype geek who spouts cliches more regularly than old faithful does steam logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate panes of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time the film also features a daughter in peril character wrestler bill goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier and a romance so tacked on i have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a good thing and when this movie ends it ends not a minute after a gigantic towering finale style explosion are the credits running no epilogue no where are they now no final kiss just explosion hug over even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible while it s no plan us tr is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy van damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths not to be seen on a serious stomach 
i m sorry for jean after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career this movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by goldbeg romeo and whatever that computers name was also some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary truly bad movie 
this movie was absolutly awful i can t think of one thing good about it the plot holes were so huge you could drive a hummer through them the acting was soo stuningly bad that even jean claude should be ashamed and that is saying alot and dialogue what dialogue to think that i was a fan of the first one i use that comment loosely its more like a guilty pleasure than anything else this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud nothing good can come of this movie what makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can t even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time because it is soo hard for me to give a 
i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony they fly to the moon in a space age dustbin carrier when there they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbase it strikes me that rubbish low budget sci fi films often involve either desert planets or like this movie criminals escaping from penal colonies why this is i have no idea but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical this one is really no exception it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half way alright dance music soundtrack it then degenerates into a boring sci fi thriller so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review so if you re reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film s subtleties and nuances for the record i recall a tedious bunch of baddies a tedious bunch of goodies some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman other than that i m struggling if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets 
this is the official sequel to the sci fi action thriller in the original van damme was among several dead vietnam war vets revived to be the perfect soldiers unisols in this one it s i guess about a dozen years later since van damme has a daughter about that age now he s working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest unisols codenamed unisol for some reason as usual something goes wrong the on site super computer named seth like the snake in king cobra the same year goes power crazy takes command of the unisols and even downloads its computer brain into a new super unisol body jai white we re lookin at the next step in evolution folks most of van damme s fights are with one particularly mean unisol pro wrestler goldberg who just keeps on comin drop him off a building no good run him down with a truck no go shoot him burn him forgetaboutit much of the humor is traced to how van damme is now outmoded and out classed he s even going grey around the edges but though he takes a lickin he keeps on kickin most sequels of this sort are pretty lame pale imitations of the originals and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius it manages to be consistently entertaining especially if you re a pro wrestling fan 
this movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jean claud vam damme stars in this movie there are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the actors bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at all and this movie by far has to be one of jean claud vam dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sport kickboxer or sudden death over all this movie is crap ok and my rating is out of 
this was an atrocious waste of my time no plot the acting was so far below par it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do it is merely a commercial rip off of the earlier universal soldier which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name by comparison it makes segall norris and arnold look almost talented perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send ups of his genre at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him 
after seeing the low budget shittier versions of the universal soldier franchise i hoped and prayed that van damme reprised his role as luc devoreaux in a second unisol movie well it seemed this prayer was answered but not the way i hoped universial soldier is just intense as poetry reading at your local library no even that would be more intriguing the fight sequences are top notch bruce lee quality which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture that and having former wcw tough guy legend goldberg playing the villain however placing goldberg as seth s sidekick lieutenant would ve been better we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself it s like some film school students slapped it together the plot holes are that bigger than kanye west s ego is what really did this movie in for example luc s daughter hillary looks like she s at least years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago how is that possible tell me that the part in which luc s partner was killed off and turned into a unisol is just re goddamn diculous you mean to tell me that there was an experimental unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie c mon the director could ve spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut but oooh nooo speaking of the plot it sucks compared to the first movie universal soldier s plot watered down and worthless where s the gritty thrills in which a unisol goes berserk an re enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something this was the dawn of the millennium you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia orwellian type of future cesspit corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad sad sad sequel from what i seen double impact under siege robocop and hell even the cheap ass no class terminator knock off class of is more entertaining than this 
i don t think any movie of van damme s will ever beat universal soldier but u never know this movie was good but not as good as st vd returns a luc must do battle again he tries b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle vd has a kid this time from ally w good it showed a pic of them goldberg was cool he does his famous move forgot what its called cause i don t watch wrestling sucks vd goldberg had some good fights it was the ending like the st but just not that good vd does his best move in his career like always the helicopter kick even though the final ending should ve been longer anyway it is worth seeing but it will never top the original 
dire just dire the script is contrived the acting painful and the story just drags along it is without a doubt a celebration of sally potter and little else this wouldn t be so bad but she s the director writer and star of the film and so is just self glorification i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters and the ending came not a moment too soon it has two redeeming features first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely particularly in paris and look rather good in black and white secondly whether you re a fan of tango or not the music is by and large excellent except where sally starts singing watch this film at your own risk or if you need an unintentional laugh i am sure it appeals to someone statistically it has to 
probably encouraged by admirers of her much better orlando potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way she writes directs stars and actually co writes the music including a mawkish love song the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her but potter s character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango perhaps if she hadn t cast herself it might have worked she just can t act whether playing herself or not pretentious over ambitious dull and silly 
the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims on the surface it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface what lies is a not so positive message about rape aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman she needs a man to help her when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her she does not stand up for herself it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying the director satish kaushik went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way the director is famous for being chauvinistic his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial it does not mean that the character herself is strong the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya cleans herself after just being raped she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light what he does not show us is whether ash s father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing thus we are left with a confusing message about rape the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this even more so the comedy is simply not funny ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout the music is mediocre except for the title track which is beautifully picturised the only bright point of this film sonali bendre s role is disappointing and pointless overall what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion 
in spite of having some exciting and daring sequences nbtn just never gets going there are exploding boats hat pin murders mass suicides pathologists with body parts and all sorts of classic mystery horror scenes but they re interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition everybody in the movie looks bored this is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed add to this the too proper brit characters and you feel like you ve drifted into a sherlock holmes movie finally the cinematography is very ordinary there are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull definitely only for lee and cushing fans 
i actually have a fondness for christopher lee but this just wasn t up to his other performances and he was one of the better actors the film does not live up to its premise it s not that scary it s overly melodramatic and it draaaaaags every time i thought oh here comes the good part the good part never quite arrived the evil ones aren t at all convincing most of the other characters were also lacking in depth perhaps if i d been in the proper frame of mind i might have enjoyed some mstie fication at this film s expense but naaahhh didn t really seem to be worth the effort it wasn t really very good it wasn t really very bad it was just mediocre 
in an otherwise good review loleralacartelort says the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy it is not that well known and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation this is completely incorrect there is and was no secret to radiation protection in apollo the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available it uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel the entire outer surface except the windows of course is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re entry these materials are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space charged particles than lead which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x rays and gamma rays space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big solar flares but it simply wasn t a serious threat to the apollo astronauts the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief hour or so passage through the van allen belts they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than rem and usually much less of the men who flew to the moon of whom landed are still alive only two have died from cancer alan shepard leukemia and jack swigert bone cancer the rest died from heart attacks pancreatitis roosa and a motorcycle accident conrad these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late s shepard would be 
i notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings or not old enough to appreciate them i think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it i was a youngster at the time of apollo but i was old enough to understand what was going on the entire world followed the moon landings our families gathered around the tv to watch the launch newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings on each day from launch to landing from moonwalks to moon liftoff all the way to splashdown in a multitude of languages in school some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on tv during apollo the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate you couldn t go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was the world was truly one community now with a buffer of odd years after the fact it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down we are left with our history books and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to prove it with a bunch of lies and made up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days 
when i was i saw the documentary a funny thing happened on the way to the moon i actually liked and believed in it for a couple of years but then i grew up and began to think and when i had sought more information this is more info from reel sources and non biased sources when i started at university not so long ago i asked an assistant professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories what he said shocked me he said that all those theories where lies that baffled me i did not believe it first but then he presented evidence for his claims he quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject humans did not go to the moon the most outrages claim was that the apollo craft could not travel through the van allen radiation belt without the crew perishing from radiation the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy it is not that well known and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation and then there is the biggest evidence of all the moon stones when the apollo missions did go to the moon they brought back many rocks from the moon to give to geologists and similar scientists who are documenting all things about the moon these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon because the internal basic elements which all matter consist of are also made of special isotopes that are different from quarry to quarry land to land and especially planet from planet the isotopes of these rocks and stones have been proved that they do not come from earth the astronauts brought home hundreds of kilogram s of these rocks all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth and from the same planet ergo the moon landings where not fake nasa did go to another planet the moon though it is not a planet but a satellite to a planet a moon duuh these rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world it has been proved humans did go to the moon it is a fact pronto but i do not worry most conspiracy theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts the fact remains humans did walk on the moon 
writer director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film unfortunately sibrel s research is so slipshod that he doesn t realize his backstage footage is really taken in large part from the minute live telecast also on that reel that was seen by millions not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts audio in the footage because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera not faking footage finally anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel s hacked up version of it he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk s assassination than of his smoking gun sibrel thinks he s the only one who s seen it what s more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth as with most films of this type sibrel relies on innuendo inexpert assumption misleading commentary and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence 
i do regret that i have bought this series i expected more action more objective picture and more consistency this is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself i find the actors work quite weak as well o donnell might seem charming as robin with batman but in this picture he lacks any charm probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up it comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands 
proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold this is most definitely plastic all the way its easy to see that without quentin s involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years that s assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes angela jones is unconvincing in this role william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in employment all in all pretty poor 
thoughtless ignorant ill conceived career killing where is the talented angela jones now deeply unfunny garbage it s no wonder reb braddock hasn t directed anything else since anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules based on his own script with the help of quentin tarantino himself and creates something like this anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world doesn t deserve a second break under the circumstances the performances are good the actors do what they re told to do and they do it well it s just that they shouldn t have done it in the first place out of 
from it s uninspiring title to the flat acting performances curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin tarantino s name is attached to it and the silly and out of place nod to the rodriguez tarantino flick from dusk till dawn these things do not make a great movie however and this is more than evident all the way through curdled the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool but it s becomes annoying very quickly especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican it doesn t fit with the tone of the movie the film s plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who because of her obsession with grisly murders takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes it sounds boring and it is william baldwin is the only name on the cast list and even he doesn t make an impression he hasn t been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing he s pretty much wasted angela jones or rather the taxi driver from pulp fiction takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman and it is always clear that it s her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role not her acting ability she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantino s masterpiece but she doesn t have the talent to lead a film by herself she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film and if it weren t for her latino accent she wouldn t convince the audience that she s a weirdo on any level curdled is a one hundred percent proof piece of forgettable trash films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics but this one fails on all levels whether you re a tarantino fan william baldwin fan horror fan or just a movie buff this is one to miss 
excruciatingly slow paced over scripted black comedy with a too clever premise and bad acting maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode but by the last half you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already 
usually i m a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has beens but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so pathetically corey haim s performance was abysmal as usual nicole eggert was not much better this has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number fan of an actor actress in this piece of trash stay away 
i d never seen a tarzan movie before so when i saw it on the tele i thought i d give it a shot unfortunately i have to say i was disappointed tarzan was over years old and somewhat overweight not how i d imagined tarzan would look and unless i missed it while making myself a cup of tea tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell also missing was tarzan swinging through the trees leaping from vine to vine oh well so much for expectations anyway jane was there the monkey cheeta was there there was some guy with a guitar there there were villains and good guys and a romance all very harmless and predictable nothing bad you understand but equally nothing good probably not the best movie to introduce tarzan 
be warned this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways each story has only a few minutes so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot just an sketchy idea of a plot the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer however that just didn t work out because you didn t get to know the characters in before or these jokes were just silly this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart a dozen times or even more i don t know and i don t care 
you know jason you know freddy and you know leatherface now get ready for the safety pin killer that s right in killer workout a dumb slasher movie if i ve ever seen one the unseen murderer dispatches his or her victims with an oversized novelty safety pin it is an odd choice to be sure the kind of thing that deserves an explanation naturally the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing as the title suggests an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect in fact the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed and since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead it s really just process of elimination oddly while the entire name cast is killed off the aerobics classes continue in earnest in fact nothing is capable of stopping the dancing while three men are murdered in the next room the workout goes on death isn t even a factor one character dies but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions director david prior knew what he was doing when named the movie killer workout and not logical workout cop chases explosive tanning beds and hundreds of shots of women s exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure much like the woman caught in the tanning bed i felt very uncomfortable by the end of killer workout finally thankfully the end flashed on the screen what happened next you got it shots of the women working out not even the end of the movie can stop them 
i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations basically because of kamal hassan he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better the protagonist raghavan is a very daring police officer who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives these two psycho killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly which the movie could have survived without to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty the director gautham should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience certainly i am never going to the movies looking like gautham s name on the production list 
on the way back from imc san jose california all five mind you three of us hardcore kamal fans of us had reached a unanimous verdict vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday not to mention we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year i won t blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan on vijay tv he said something like tamizh cinema la photography editing la namba munnera na maadri screenplay direction acting la innum namba munnera la tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing but we have hardly improved when it comes to screenplay direction and acting while you re watching vv those words ring very true now here are the reasons to hate this movie harris jeyaraj harris jeyaraj harris jeyaraj i m barely holding myself from using expletives here but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his remember anniyan ghajini with the jarring cacophony he bills as background music the next time i have an eardrum transplant he s paying for it songs neither do the songs help move the movie s narration spatially temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice the film feels like it s made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them a short gone too far vv at best is fit to be a short story not a hour plus thriller to use a clich here like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on only in this case you don t want it to the later part of a movie feels like a big drag kamal jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together could ve produced more sparks than this lead pairing there s no reason you would root for them to make it together in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie they make a good irritant to the narration hate to say this but kamalini mukerjhee s minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus thenali kamal haasan s accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us and it isn t new either he s been doing it since thoongadae thambi thoongadae it s simply gets on the nerve imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us he doesn t leave it at the immigration either he offers doses of advice to his men bewildered tn cops from keeranor sathoor and beyond in chaste kamanglish wha we hav here is plain bad police wok of course with nauseating effect logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense which d c p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after the scene inside the theatre was so bad towards the climax we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero s iq is he stupid can t he just use his siren or lights on a busy madras road kamal the cop on a police jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude can t he just use his gun the guy on a bike starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time i m not voting in favour of the later but i m just trying to explain the mood inside gore violence if i wanted to watch women being raped their throats getting slashed more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity i would sit at home and rather watch a police report or kuttram the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story not overwhelm it somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions rapes murders are and what the mainstay story is even a double shot espresso couldn t get the pain out of the head 
based upon the recommendation of a friend my wife and i invited another couple to this film i really apologized to them all of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end half the vignettes are bizarre with very little entertainment value there were few scenes of paris for example i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter but i couldn t really recognize anything most of the scene was inside a bar no one in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way if you like bizarre pretentious pseudo intellectual films don t miss this if you are down to earth like me you will be sorry you saw it 
about three minutes into this thing i started fast forwarding pausing only during the nudity why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women in ten minutes i was done and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store the people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the mpaa come on writers the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy s remote control that s the way its been done since the days of the ottoman empire also to add insult to injury the twist at the end was so formulaic that it could have come from any action movie written in the past years burt reynolds was fine but he should concentrate on real movies this movie is just a waste of time run away run away 
don t get fooled with all the big names like burt reynolds james woods and anne archer they are just glorified extra s their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so whatever their motives for being in this movie if you have an actor like james woods you better make good use of him to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through the plot itself wasn t that bad and the acting from most of the actors was above average cuba gooding jr however was terrible he was so unbelievable that i almost laughed at his dramatic scenes and since this was meant as a serious movie that can t be a good thing the action scenes were not bad but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting again better direction was needed also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this it took the main character almost half an hour to get in action for an action thriller of only minutes that is far too slow the only redeeming factor is angie harmon she does her best to make it all work too bad the director left her hanging yes this movie could have been much better with a great director andy cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off and for an action stunt coordinator of his caliber you d expect at least more exciting action scenes don t waste your time with this one avoid 
an ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting if only you could bring yourself to care this twisting and turning i speak of refers not to the story which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole but to the director s inability to keep the characters faces even remotely centered in the frame on the other hand angie harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear the only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it when you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all star cast you might be inclined to think something stinks and indeed it does 
mst should do this movie it is the worst acted movie i have ever seen first of all you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in and pays his rent in cash there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job also the head of security for the pothus would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot this movie sucked i cannot express the extremite that this movie was every single actor was terrible even the chick at the trailer park i crap on this garbage what a waste of time 
this ranks as one of the worst movies i ve seen in years besides cuba and angie the acting is actually embarrassing wasn t archer once a decent actress what happened to her the action is decent but completely implausible the make up is so bad it s worth mentioning i mean who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film someone should tell the make up artist and the dop that you re not supposed to actually see it the ending is a massive disappointment along the lines of and then they realized it was all a dream don t waste your time or your money you re better off just staring into space for hours 
i rented end game having never heard of it but i m fond of political thrillers so i thought i d give it a shot after doing some research on the movie i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release but instead had gone strait to dvd after seeing it i m thinking no wonder the movie is shocking in its unoriginality the plot and the characters are perfunctory i figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball i have to say i didn t expect it to end quite the way it did but that s not a point in its favor the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist even one that made the movie even worse stay away i want the and my minutes back 
this movie looked good good cast evergreen topic and an explosive opening it went downhill from there why was it filmed by hand held camera it shakes judders part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer a poor choice indeed as if this was not enough the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all and then it commits the worst sin of all after leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion they roll credits without revealing the denouement the ending the payoff like what the heck was the motive how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending doh this movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud what a waste of effort poor effort by writer and director 
only a handful of the segments are engaging here a segment with a garage attendant from nigeria is heartbreaking one with fanny ardent bob hoskins makes its point twist by twist until the final shot overplays things the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke paris the others are so scatter shot in theme tone volition production that you may as well be watching the years best commercials it s really all over the place it doesn t develop over it s running time and nothing reigns the directors in no construct successfully joins the pieces tedium sets in i m at the one hour twenty minute point and elijah wood is in some dumb over commercial overproduced vampire shtick it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies knitting in the antartic fantasy shows up i think first in the coen brothers segment uh thanks j e for ruining another movie and then makes way too many appearances the point of being in paris is that you don t need make believe crap to make your days extraordinary why divide it by neighborhood if quartier de la madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director has there ever been a genre more over represented than the vampire film every three years we get the same lame vampire clich s making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless the transitions get lost this doesn t feel intentional it feels sloppy 
spoilers ahead this is one of the worst movies ever made it s that simple there is not one redeeming quality about this movie the first minutes are quite tricky they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat instead you will spend minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization the lake was ridiculous looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed characters show their advanced teleportation powers for example alex thomas who falls into the lake drunk and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position angie harmon put up a pitiful performance as kate made worse by the space time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader an example of this would be when she said flashlight in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half finally the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that i have ever seen it was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists an example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on alex s car i would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie the ending was absolutely pathetic the writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say oh yeah instead we re left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line unfortunately there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap i give this a out of the being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book 
so i m looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called end game it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller well worth a look then or so i thought boy was i wrong end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring now being something of a whodunnit i can t really tear into it as i would like without ruining it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity but questions such as why has he she they done this and where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off are all too abundant following the film s unintentionally hilarious conclusion as for the acting you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor s realised that they ve made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie and this then shows in their performance this is one of those accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison of course this didn t make it to the cinema and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room it is appalling 
predictable hackneyed poorly written foolishly i reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit i guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days and will only get worse that one cannot pick and choose much any more early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since the movie lacked intrigue giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder some of the discourse was frankly embarrassing it s hard to believe anyone would even consider let alone commit to the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe 
please help the economy spend your money elsewhere the synopsis of the movie is the first lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her that s it undetected by anyone except cuba and angie she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about and gets away completely free some specific points are particularly hilarious while standing in front of the president cuba a deflects the assassin s bullet which then enters the back of the president s head cuba and angie watch film from a news camera and they see a clue they go to great lengths to protect the film believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film cuba speaks with a presidential staff member the psm comments that there was no conspiracy cuba claims there was more than one person involved the psm then rants that the conspiracy includes the fbi the cia and the nsa gosh i wonder is the psm is involved ms archer the first lady is a craptacular artist cuba can t make out a painting and she says you re too close stand back look from a different perspective look from my perspective can anyone miss that clue 
end game started well the least said about the end the better it seemed like things we re happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no reason for this apart from the next scene wouldn t make sense without it the whole story could have been told in about minutes it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job considering the end game was honestly one of the worst films i ve ever seen and that s saying something i ve seen gigli 
my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory however of the pages of reviews only a handful are negative i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future i admit i m more inspired to write reviews when i don t like a movie than as to when i do so my handful of reviews are all negative still that doesn t mean i m biased towards not enjoying a movie but i often find more eloquent reviews of movies i do enjoy paris je t aime is the most pretentious movie i ve seen in years by using an intelligent concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories the movie ends up the worst of all worlds it is art for arts sake but something that a year old could dream up and accomplish giving the director free reign of minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment directors can t write writers can t direct i d like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated but that is because he s an actor turn director which rarely works either what ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that don t make any sense are not completed in minutes and in total spoil paris to me why call it paris je t aime when a more apropos title is cluster f ck there are only a couple stories that are watchable most notably the piece by alfonso cuar n but everything else will fall into obscurity the coen brothers short is passable but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar it s as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it as we all love paris present company included we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks in fact i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their minutes seriously seriously people natalie portman is not a good actress she is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours and maggie gyllenhaal why are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies i m looking at you natalie portman garden state closer elijah wood sin city and catalina sandino moreno maria full of grace one final comment on the acting i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again find his short on youtube as his minutes are quite enjoyable writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right i m thinking of ernst hemingway raymond carver f scott fitzgerald and john cheever just to name a few it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this the same can be said about short films it appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history if you uphold paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story then don t expect to enjoy this movie at all the directors either didn t care or were lazy in either scenario by the time you are reading this it means you rented it praise be that you didn t pay dollars a head in theaters for it 
 ok i have read about this film somewhere in the internet and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was and i couldn t have been more agree about it then after that i saw this film on dvd i was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on tv luckily i spared my money for this pieces of crap i was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn t make me satisfy so i can t be judging on how the film was made but anyway it still sucks as for those who liked this film i would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is i don t know what do you think about this film 
on the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self by embracing the so called dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully however if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from grace is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once lost now found famous race car and is warned by the salesman lesson just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced in addition there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubin s own personal greed for more profit lesson thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and more importantly rubin s car the main character s assessment of the car s qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room lesson a car is not just to be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collector s car this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson there are numerous other examples in the movie of the car person theme and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and i guess this is what i m really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or if you re a car devotee 
first of all i thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by preston sturges sturges was one of the better hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired however it wasn t the preston sturges it was preston sturges jr the story was essentially based on robert louis stevenson s short story the bottle imp a good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell that s fine nobody said screenwriters had to be original the actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen my biggest complaint comes with the ending the hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person at first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film this is a stupid convention the older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end there is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think you can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end in fact i think it s preferable 
yes i sat through the whole thing god knows why it was a long afternoon i had nothing to do it was bitterly cold outside okay those are all lame excuses but they re the only ones i have i gave the darkling stars out of a possible i have seen worse films but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom poor script poor acting bad lighting and cheesy special effects the storyline which never completely makes sense revolves around this simple little family daddy mommy and little girl that i assume the viewer is supposed to be identifying with all three of them were tedious and annoying you just want the dark side to get every one of them daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars daddy meets a rich man named rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the mysterious orient rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as the darkling during the course of the film the darkling is explained as being about or different things a shadow without a person the inner darkness that exists in all of us and the devil so take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy because trust me it doesn t really matter the darkling s main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion it gets a human companion and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being this of course leads to immense wealth followed by disaster for the human who hooks up with the darkling and for the rest of us it just leads to a very long tedious movie 
 st watched out of dir brad sykes mindless d movie about flesh eating zombies in a story within a movie chronicle and yes we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in d wow not that has been done time and time again in d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh eating that s what made the original zombie classics good the flesh eating was just thrown in as an extra we re actually bored throughout most of this part chronicle because of the lame twilight zone like easily understood and slow pacingly revealed finale s the last story is actually the story the movie started with having a reporter investigating a so called ghost town and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie s in that one as well well i think i ve said enough watch the classics not this d bore feast 
merry madcaps in london stage a treasure hunt with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong independent lady flier who s never been in love intriguing early vehicle for katharine hepburn playing an amelia earhart like aviatrix who s been too self involved to give herself over to any man the director dorothy arzner and the screenwriter zoe akins who adapted gilbert frankau s book were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view but why are all the old clich s kept intact like frozen artifacts billie burke plays the type of simpering weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong and hepburn s final scene is another bummer a curious artifact but not a classic for kate watchers from 
dialogue stilted clich d acting hammy clich d plot predictable clich d just what are christopher plummer nastassia kinski doing in this b rubbish plummer was well established decades before this movie was made kinski had masterpieces like tess and cat people behind her must have been desperate the bad guys all have bad guy accents bad bad guy accents plummer especially where did he learn to do german and most of them have bad guy sneers as well the innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh the good guy survives amongst other things a throwing knife buried hilt deep in his shoulder just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all marines machine gun fire i think someone referred to a in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp several fist fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium first into a door frame a fall backwards from what looks like the third floor onto paving without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience the script has exactly clever lines the rest of the time it s all so dull and boring ok it s not all bad plummer does bring a certain class to his part and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick of course that doesn t say much but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here he delivers his ve haff vays and meance type lines with some menace but you are always aware you are watching christopher plummer acting the villain this movie is truly an awful waste of time the acting such as it is is sort of s movies wooden line delivery meets bruce lee s very obviously faked fight scenes but it s not even anywhere near as good as either a roger moore or a bruce lee film don t bother 
but thomas ian griffith just doesn t have the polish that a big bucks actor has granted this was made years ago some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action but comedy and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow plummer s character was so corny he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon personally if action flicks are going to show skin i d have liked to have seen equal time between female male otherwise don t show any 
maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun check isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen check tasty looking love interest check assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy european accents check german sounding bad guy played by an english actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion check corny one liners check deary me does this film take the wee wee or what the clich s come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is in a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of die hard only set on a mountain complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid we have all the usual action move clich s ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off jack wild is the cop in full on john mcclane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point in amidst this mess there are a few well known recognisable faces who i can only assume needed the cash and or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects looking up this three quid from the supermarket bargain bin effort on imdb i am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels i have got to find these gems on dvd it looks like the first sequel is a rip off of under siege and the second sequel well goodness knows one thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing jack changes with each film and even the character s name seems to change for the third instalment still blind purchases of cheap dvd s just would not be the same if studios didn t keep trotting out material of this awful quality 
this movie had the potential to be really good considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci fi actioner the hidden and dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles but someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one dolph plays a butt kicking monk who travels to new york to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for years he must battle the minion who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like the hidden and jason goes to hell the minion naturally wants the key so it can let the antichrist out along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and dolph are chased by the minion possessed bodies if i m making this sound entertaining forget it the pacing is very awkward and sluggish the acting subpar at best and the fight scenes staged poorly dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career the cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine gun wielding monks at the monastery but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest too bad i really wanted to like this 
dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the anti christ is found by an archaeologist of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isn t killed so easily as he transfers from body to body like fallen without the suspense of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren like steven seagal and jean claude van damme i try to watch his movies whenever they re on tv i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed this movie is utterly terrible with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena worst of all is lundgren s woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen which was good and end of days which was bad but better than this overall this movie is the worst movie i ve seen from dolph lundgren it literally has nothing to recommend it it s awful and it s the lowest point in lundgren s career and i saw cover up the last warrior and masters of the universe out of awful 
what happened what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never really got going there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it steve martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot 
near the closing stages of baby mama one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it was all just a mess i really couldn t say it any better than that and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone s time a lacklustre cast mundane script and vague caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isn t taxing on the ol noggin but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour consisting mainly of very routine clich jokes based around an odd couple rich and poor trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic as a story on finding love it s not that bad but playing this plot line as a side story of sorts to work alongside the comedy orientated odd couple tangent characterisation is notably weak resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles as characters themselves both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness so while we may eventually come to find the character s interactions with each other amusing at times the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles we don t feel for the characters and don t find them inherently interesting but rather their dynamic unfortunately however although this dynamic works best or at least better than the individual personas as mentioned above it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd couple formula kate tina fey is a successful business woman who has hired working class dumb blonde angie amy poehler to be her unlikely surrogate and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl dax shepard both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences yes it s the typical odd couple premise and one that we have already seen in this year s what happens in vegas yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi layered characters kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air in fact the movie s only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door man of the few times that i laughed during baby mama most of those moments were because of this man and the remainder usually fell to shepard it s a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script s themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough yet for a film about babies multi million dollar business and cultural stereotyping this isn t necessarily a good thing baby mama is grade a hammy plastic tinsel town with capital bore topped with sugar so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two dimensional nature but i simply didn t care for the world they inhabited the dialogue along with sets costumes and the script s general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director s incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy these aren t characters and that isn t our world in any way so why should i care at the end of the day however a romantic comedy s ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests and the frequency of its laughs baby mama has little going on in any of these departments of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair i m sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch baby mama is too light headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining a review by jamie robert ward http www invocus net 
i wouldn t say this totally sucked but if it wasn t for netflix i wouldn t even have this in my house steve martin s eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat he s just not funny he s another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn t get pregnant the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple simmer along not really entertaining or creating laughs 
i agree with the previous comment the beginning of the movie is quite good and get s you wandering about what is to come which is nothing all open story lines remain open two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture save for or very short scenes i wander if ilya wouldn t have done better to just completely leave them out as for the one remaining character nothing is done with her either she just visits some god awful place and suddenly the movie isn t about her anymore but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread drinking homemade vodka and apparently flashing each other some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling like the judges of the iffr but for me it is just bad taste bad camera work a lousy script and frightfully bad direction therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading 
the first hour of the movie was boring as hell there is no suspense no action not even a plot the movie went no where i mean they could have made the movie in min short film overall the movie wasn t good at all and i don t recommend it 
film starts with people meeting each other in the bar ok they re talking about their imaginary lives lying all the time with no reason still ok from time to time they even make you laugh interesting first minutes you actually enjoy it but then things become worse nothing s happening for a long time and then when something happen all you can see are naked old ladies touching each other not ok disgusting by the way this part should be the top of the movie but it s everything except that movie has no point it s boring and sick the strangest thing is that here belgrade serbia on fest film festival this movie was the most popular according to researches of course before people watched it i even thought before watching hay this might be interesting although it s a russian movie but god no 
the russian movie follows the lives of three not four strangers who meet one night in a local bar one is a musician one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl i gather is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post soviet russia the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes operating secret cloning facilities selling decades old frozen meat etc but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody s really up to here despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes is a two hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs 
i m starting to think that there s a conspiracy all right one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film despite its obscurity will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a universal acclaim or something within that range thus ensuring unsuspecting folk like me will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing expecting a surprise only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck this movie is one of them it has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article i come across because it s rather clear that two things might have happened either i didn t get the message that is so hidden beneath this film s inner realms as to be impossible to access or they and i watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name is a dirty trick on the audience it s no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say smorsgabord and that despite the rating it got on metacritic no one had heard of it it s terrible with sugar on top firstly there is the ever present number four from start to finish while having a little symbolism here and there is okay and it s been done with various degrees of success in many well known movies this movie is panting with it four dogs at the start of the movie looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt four people in a bar although one of them is a non entity three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless not only to each other but to what their lives are not while this concept may work the movie meanders so much particularly with the story of the would be model played by marina vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre and not in a good way that the initial theme gets lost in translation or maybe like i said before i just didn t get it the problem also lies in that so much time is spent on marina s story which revolves on the death of her sister from bread chewing no less and the subsequent shrill mourning which follows that any interest in the inherent surrealism dissipates without a trace so what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own the director doesn t invest much time in truly tying them together or weaving a tighter story that could in a david lynchian way intersect either with the past present or within alternate dimensions or even as a straightforward mundane science fiction story this is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint or someone into the weird for weird s sake could endure 
i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie i guess i must have missed something the beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories that s the best part after the three go their separate ways the film splits into three threads that s when boredom sets in certainly the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity unfortunately the director beat this one to death even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular bottom line a two hour plot thin listlessness if you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep 
the movie starts quite with an intriguing scene three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar all of them are making up a bit outrageous stories as the movie unfolds it turns out that the most outrageous story is true however beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed this revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly not much is left to be seen the rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies sure these are fascinating and a bit shocking images but admiring them goes on way too long sacrificing any possible plot or character development i found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie making where instead of trying to make an interesting story movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories case in point meat trader s story to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends on a surface it has artsy appearance but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent 
i can t believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i ve ever wasted my time on it s just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh s character around by his nose the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer which has been left out in the sun too long the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham movie ever and this isn t changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie don t waste your time here 
mabel at the wheel is one of those movies with a behind the scenes story that s more interesting than the movie itself this was chaplin s tenth comedy for keystone during his year of apprenticeship and his first two reeler here he played one of his last out and out villain roles although the feature length tillie s punctured romance was yet to come and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself in fact chaplin s conflicts with director and co star mabel normand almost got him fired from the studio chaplin hadn t gotten along with his earlier directors henry lehrman and george nichols but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere girl was the last straw charlie and mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film chaplin was still a newcomer at keystone and his colleagues didn t know what to make of him but everyone loved mabel producer mack sennett was on the verge of firing chaplin when he learned that the newcomer s films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them a s a p so chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way mabel wanted it unfortunately none of that drama is visible on screen in mabel at the wheel which looks like typical keystone chaos the story concerns an auto race in which mabel s beau harry mccoy is scheduled to compete but wicked charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad and mabel must take the wheel in his place for all the racing around brick hurling and finger biting the film is frankly short on laughs but there are a few points of interest there s some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence though there aren t really any gags just lots of frantic activity chaplin himself looks odd sporting a goat like beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance making a living but the outfit suits the old fashioned villainy he displays throughout at least it s novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role visible in the stands at the race track are such keystone stalwarts as chester conklin edgar kennedy in a strangely dandified get up and a more characteristic mack sennett spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine as a performer sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced but you have to give the guy credit he knew what people liked these films were hugely popular in their day mack s performance doesn t add much to mabel at the wheel but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didn t kill each other 
i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago what a disaster the acting was atrocious there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn t ring true supposedly a modern reworking of the hitchcock original lifeboat i think hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it from what i was able to suffer through there is nothing compelling in this movie it boasts a few semi big names but they put no effort into their characters but you know to be fair it was nobody s fault really i mean i m pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion lol it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along but for me i m not willing to spend at least three days to find out so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon avoid this stinker 
boring predictable by the numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of mindless mayhem and gore to satisfy mindless genre fans mostly it s about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we don t care an iota about if that s your thing tune in 
who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordon s legendary bad trash film food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late s location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the s this script hangs together by clich s awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielberg s jaws started there s an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new sport complex gnaw food of the gods is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know it s infested with rats the acting is atrocious and there s a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth serum i wonder what freud s theory would be on that there s a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and it has to be said the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just can t get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creature features revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest s cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent rat movies by once famous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts 
nothing to say but wow has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field well this happens about times in this movie clearly the directors favorite scare tactic in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film shortly after he arrives to the field the contestants show up and although it is clearly at latest in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute after about minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown s history in which we see some of his previous victims if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest her ribs go all the way to her neck it was flat out disgusting most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically definitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field signed the answer
why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance i want a refund can i have my back while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen nothing did happen the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really like the film why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out it was not very artistic why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading or was that the point i felt like phantom love had no story at all and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film 
del you are the dumbest smart person i ve ever met calvin well i had a brain but they lost it in the re writes i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimov s work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed in the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists able to think her way through a problem here she s just a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued by wil smith there are passing references to asimov s laws of robotics but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenes smith is likable as he is in most of his films but honestly the story isn t that good you figure it out long before these genius characters do 
waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand i expected an interesting sci fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot technology instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it once more proving that stunning special effects can t help a boring plot which by my opinion was the worse in this year acting in this movie also dissatisfied me will smith didn t show anything new in this movie yet i never saw his acting to change since men in black which was his only success by my opinion he had to retire since than not spoiling his name with titles like i robot and men in black 
in spite of the great future design touches the clever asimov premise and will smith s dependable cool performance this movie doesn t live up to expectations the clich s come thick and fast waking from a recurring nightmare maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant to list more would be spoiling it you can see the end a mile off this movie is also stagebound you never feel that you have travelled anywhere what s supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago the robots themselves are good in closeup but the crowd scenes look more like bad disney the cgi is overdone again and again and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them why do they need to inject nanites you know it s a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax it could have been great but it s less than the sum of its parts mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years 
this film is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film unnecessary slow motion unnecessary flipping jumping somersaults unnecessary characters unnecessary dialogue basically unnecessity is that a word well it s just been invented by i robot what happened to practicality i e the car garage the skin spray the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop what happened to showing respect for women i e smith s character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film and yet she still wants him where is the tension i ll tell you where good looks and not admiration or common ground what happened to a detective that detects smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself complaining to other people and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off this is such a lame way to get the story from point b c d etc it was ok once but not several times in a row speaking of several times in a row what was the i m snoring and not listening to you joke twice in one scene what happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes shia labeouf the kid is in the movie for a total of two scenes we know that a he degrades women and b he knows smith so of course we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm what happened to hero s let s just forget that there are people women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that i have an acquaintance with and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air showing off while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot don t get me wrong i m all for spectacle but i m also all for a shred of realism and meaning i have to say i ve never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time so thanks alex i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques simpler stories and simpler everything else in films but mainly simpler techniques big budget action films you so have to die 
this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store don t make the same mistake i did this movie is tedious unconvincingly acted and generally boring the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered i cringed at every scene they shared dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo irish accents odd anyway when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store keep walking 
first of all what is good in the movie some pretty actress the exotic background the fact that the actors don t laugh while acting i would have if i had been in their situation i don t know the storyline is simple a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who another abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute raped by another priest when he was young i m afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion dennis hopper is not very good here this is the worst episode of the worst season of profiler the serie with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences the uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another victim s house could have a baby with the priest etc etc 
not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc but easily the worst never seeing the light of day the director is not even canadian but british and boy does it show we are all made out to be a bunch of over sexed dope fiends and morons the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk of course the british character is normal the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype can you say norm the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes the actors always seem to be fidgetting are they as bored as the viewer or is this the directors idea of cinema avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically you won t be compelled to walk out on his films after minutes 
this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine moronic idiots the men get stoned drunk and then they yell beat each other up in almost every scene the women are superfluous to the story i do not understand what they are there for they spend every scene causing a ruckus or worse milling around like mesmerized cattle apparently canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks it s the standard knocked up girlfriend her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before every character here is a carping infantile stereotype not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt shudder is enough to make anyone gag i watched the movie because samuel west was in it but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this maybe he needed the money ian tracey is a superb actor the only one with a vague redeeming moment but his talent is wasted here as for the rest of the plot the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back yawn or karl who is dead but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock s masterpiece although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films why even bother karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying by the end of this wretched movie i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat 
i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored how can people possibly give this a it s not just that it s supposed to be a feel good redemption film i think because it doesn t work on that level either weak plot bad dialogue terrible acting there s just nothing there harvey keitel is decent but has nothing to work with and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible the plot progression especially the relationship between byron and ashley makes no sense it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow it s only an hour and a half but that s minutes of your life you ll never get back 
might contain possible spoilers not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion sure it s cheaper for them but after a while wouldn t you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are the voices don t even remotely match up and iago is evil again since when i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films even the movie s musical number which had been disney s specialty for years stunk i wouldn t recommend this film to anyone even the very young all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released it s only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality 
have not watched kids films for some years so i missed here come the tigers when it first came out never even saw bad news bears even though in the s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie warriors man who would be king and rocky horror picture show among others now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things at least watching for his her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren t doing the job lo and behold i spied wes craven s name in the credits as an electrical gaffer he d already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the scream movies maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic more surprising was fred j lincoln in the cast credits as aesop a wacky character in the movie f j lincoln from the s to just a few years ago appeared in and produced adult films he was associated with the adult spoof the ozporns and just that title is funnier than all of tigers attempts at humor combined let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel 
the saddest part of this is the fact that these are minutes i ll never get back i knew this was terrible from the get go with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof see if they could get away with that in my year old boy is really into baseball right now so we decided to rent it on a rainy day even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language bad bad movie this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears completely shameless and completely predictable i don t mind a predictable movie if it s done well but this one absolutely was not 
what a stinkeroo this turned out to be at one time much earlier in her career linda darnell was one of my favorites no great shakes as an actress but very beautiful and pleasant particularly in films like the mark of zorro and blood and sand but when i saw this monstrosity the memories of her golden days faded quickly the story is unbelievable and farcical the acting second rate the supporting cast insufferable i cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to tab hunter and donald gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked added to this was the terrible photography and i am not just referring to the color everyone associated with this must have shuddered whenever it was shown 
this movie is horrible it rivals ishtar in the number of embarrassingly bad moments i would have rated it lower than a save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was crap it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever 
when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn t fail i love billy crystal my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it we were misled in spades on my part i felt billy crystal s character was extremely one dimensional and did very little for the film sure he cracked a couple of good jokes but as a character he did nothing but take up space and poor julia roberts in past shows she plays well as a strong willed self determined lady in this flick she seems completely repressed and had very little fire this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching ok if i were to find one good thing it would have to be christopher walken now that s entertainment but just like billy crystal hardly anything is shown of his character if you re looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value go see it but if you re looking for a smart romantic comedy this is not your film it s none of the above 
characters you don t care about relationships you don t care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start julia roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other she was actually somewhat endearing in this role 
have you ever heard the saying that people telegraph their intentions well in this movie the characters actions do more than telegraph future plans they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced embeth davidtz s character is not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesn t succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have the bottom line obvious plot one note performances unlikeable characters and grotesque southern accents employed by british actors 
billy crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face or perhaps just one they call it comedy i say it s a waste of my time 
wow what a great cast julia roberts john cusack christopher walken catherine zeta jones hank azaria what s that a script you say now you re just being greedy surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary you d think so but no america s sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another it s like everyone involved woke up before each day s writing shooting editing and though you know what i ve been working pretty hard lately and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names right i m just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can so much potential yet so painful to sit through there isn t a single aspect of this thing that doesn t suck even julia s fat suit is lame 
how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me this is a terrible clich ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film what s even worse is the fact that is made almost million here in the states it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks even if the film is terrible i felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore fest billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions whatever you do don t fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this 
let me put it another way balls or how about bollo ks this is truly awful more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise julia roberts is a skilled actress and usually her work is of the highest standard this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient normally she is the consummate professional yet i swear that in her eyes there were signs of bewilderment and despair the one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director chris walken turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors unfortunately that theme wasn t explored to it s full potential too little too late zeta jones was wooden cusack was cusack and crystal should stick to acting the two talented ex buffy stars had different experiences green hopelessly mis cast and balfour under used well done to julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made 
and i mean ultra light this film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that there really isn t too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isn t very funny nor does it work at all as a romance how about as a romantic comedy not on your life most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusing what s really ashame is the premise is not bad at all this movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics the film uncovers the un mined territory of the press junket those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film s lame romance the same with catherine zeta jones character the whinny self centered movie star zeta jones does a good job with what she s given but she s given practically nothing it s all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we ve heard about stars over the years in the end it is hard to understand what made zeta jones julia roberts john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a rerun of the love boat in fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal it would probably make a better story so go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this

first of all i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema which is because the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos as the director and marketing ads imply in my mere opinion the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant however the acting is near perfect in fact most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked talent all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job even the less experienced ones like janset at least altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation just because he knows well how to choose the cast other than that he is just a media monkey who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent come on art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked half naked women and just because media boasts off no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema just close your ears and o something real artistic i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work hope this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach in short pros good acting hot women just kidding cons each and every single thing other than the cast
terrible movie if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in that should be banyo what a waste of time other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing nada zilch nil the dialog is cheap and sexual clich s are all over it the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting the only good thing i can say about the movie is wait wait there is nothing good i can say about it i must have really disliked it to write about it this much jeez 
i saw this film at the toronto international film festival based on a novella by science fiction author brian aldiss this film attempts to tell the story of tom and barry howe conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band almost deliberately gimmicky the film is also too clever by half if you ll pardon the pun by mixing genres styles and moods the directors whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha lose their way pretty quickly i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not flashbacks dream sequences it was all just a bit much plus the promised rock and roll just didn t move me i was reminded a bit too much at times of hedwig and the angry inch a film i found original and moving but in this case the songs just weren t as good nor were the main characters sympathetic a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine 
would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it 
yes kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies but with humanity here we have shaq as a rapping genie yes a rapping genie where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits all ending in him in a christ like pose with lots of light surrounding him so yeah expect really cheesy bits including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky and regrettably not knocking out the two main characters particularly the kid what might not be expected is that a film with a kid and shaquille o neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy the main plot of the film involves this kid played in that all too typical and annoying kid fashion by the great grandson of frank capra where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily who comes upon a genie who s been trapped in a boom box then hiarity ensues as the kid makes the shaq genie his quasi slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady gang type absentee father this really sappy contrived son and father story would be bad enough as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies i e the two chances in life speech from father to son but it s shaquille o neill who is both the reason to watch the film ironically and the obvious sinking crux of it all his plot line involves him when not getting the over talky treatment from capra to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career on top of this he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom box so is there a camp factor to the movie up to a point but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and heart felt moments that have really no business with the rest of the material one might ask if the people making the movie who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a basketball player who wanted to go on the michael jordan acting bandwagon if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing i d hope that they too knew they were just getting paid but i d hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the shaq machine so if you want to have a fun night of shaq as genie turned rapper turned wisecracker all the more fun to you hell it might even be interesting to have a shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort steel but if you re hoping to keep a few brain cells stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of and a candidate among many others for worst of the s 
if the crew behind zombie chronicles ever read this here s some advice guys in a twist ending type movie it s not a good idea to insert close ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits that tends to spoil the twists y know i know you produced this on a shoestring and to be fair you worked miracles with your budget but please hire people who can actually act or at least walk talk and gesture at the same time joe haggerty i m looking at you if you re going to set a part of your movie in the past only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time twist endings are supposed to be a surprise sure we don t want twists that make no sense but signposting the reveal as soon as you introduce a character that s not a great idea kudos to the guys for trying but in all honesty i d rather they hadn t only for zombie completists 
reviewing kazaam and saying it s a bad movie isn t hard at all after all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film saying it was among the worst films of the decade so the fact that i say it s bad or anyone else says it s bad is certainly no surprise it s like someone talking about wwii practically no one says that was a good thing right the question i have and no place on imdb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place after all it s obvious to anyone who isn t severely brain injured that the film would be horrible but movies like ed a baseball playing chimp cool as ice starring the ever popular vanilla ice troll which doesn t even have any trolls in it baby geniuses einstain like superhero babies and pinocchio in outer space huh prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen so the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright normal the film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school like the punk from free willy this kid is somehow misunderstood in other words a total brat and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is by the end of the film he ll have learned something and grown just once i want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film eventually while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him the genie kazaam shaquille o neal is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes but the kid doesn t believe him and the genie s magic seems a tad rusty eventually the brat does realize that kazaam is for real however unlike most kids he withholds making his wishes so in the meantime kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere like his own personal servant and according to the clich you know that by the end of the film max and kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed oh and max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom s fianc i m gonna gag apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes as for kazaam shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap very poorly i m a middle aged white guy and i think i could probably rap at least as well he s an amazing basketball player and i ve heard he s a nice guy but a rapper no way as far as his acting goes he wasn t great but had such a nice personality in the film that it s hard to hate him even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things so is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you ve probably heard through the first two thirds of the movie i would have said no shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script however later in the film the bad becomes horrid as kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he s really needed and out of nowhere the plot gets really really weird as the guy who wants to make kazaam a rap star turns out to be an evil mobster and oddly this guy seems to accept that kazaam is a genie with no hesitation in addition the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill max and his dad i know that the kid was annoying but this is supposed to be a kids film what part of trying to kill the kid didn t the writers not understand then in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug induced hallucination this ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in the black hole and boy did it make my brain hurt uggghh the horrible dialog was just too much to bear overall it s a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane yes folks with a messed up message bizarre non kid friendly material and horrible characters this is one wretched film sadly given the idea and actors it s hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse by the way if you want to see a genie in a modern world film that is good try the british made for tv film bernard and the genie a charming and exceptionally well written film from start to finish 
the only reason i dvrd this movie was because i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and i ve always heard how awful it was the movie did not disappoint the best parts were shaq s outfits the worst parts were well just about everything else my year old son and i just squirmed and couldn t look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didn t wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his but for all it s terribleness we just couldn t stop watching it the story sucked you in like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit it was hypnotic but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched kazzam 
this movie has successfully proved what we all already know that professional basket ball players suck at everything besides playing basket ball especially rapping and acting i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is first of all is it just me or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen i mean his teeth could be used as a can opener secondly why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when even though he has magical powers he sucks horribly at making music third i have read the bible in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made genies fourth what was the deal with all the crappy special effects i assure you that any acne addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that fifth why did the ending suck so badly and what the hell is a djin and finally whoever created the nightmare known as kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower because this movie take the word suck to an entirely new level 
i was given the book version of kazaam for my th birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong at least with the movie it s over soon the acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor he s bullied by neighborhood kids which i don t blame them because he s a little douche bag the story is just plain stupid and extremely clich about a boy who s father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father even at years old i thought this was a stupid idea it s a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it s an embarrassment and should have never been made i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot 
how a director of altman s experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with or to care about what happens to a lead character who is neurotic a whiner a jerk with no redeeming qualities that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work a monstrous piece of trash in addition to this crippling flaw the plot line requires serious concentration to follow the setup that the branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience this latter issue is at the core of the film it represents directorial self indulgence with profound contempt for the taste values and intelligence of the viewer very unusual for mr altman patrick watson
there s only one thing i need to say about this movie the scene where shaq is in a musical number with francis capra s character about wanting to be a genie never see this movie the story is horrible the acting is terrible c mon it s shaq and i d rather see capra in free willy equally horrible twice before ever seeing this movie 
i love the book jane eyre and have seen many versions of it all have their strong points and their faults however this was one of the worst i have seen i didn t care about jane or mr rochester charlotte gainsbourg jane was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part but she had no emotion in any of her lines i couldn t imagine what mr rochester saw in her that brings us to mr rochester william hurt had even less emotion than jane if that were possible how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery but it certainly didn t hold my attention perhaps the director zeffrelli fell asleep during the production the timothy dalton too handsome for mr rochester version is far more faithful to the book but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr rochester in the a e version which is not all that true to the book trying to find something positive about this movie geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role 
this movie was the first adaptation of jane eyre that i ever watched and when i did so i was appalled by it so much of the novel had been left out and i considered william hurt to be terribly miscast as rochester since then i have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel the three short versions of and and the three mini series of and and i have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse rochesters this is without doubt the most exquisite jane eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned director franco zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky of lonely rochester standing on a rock and of jane looking out of the window but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life in addition his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes as a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between jane and rochester and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse there are a number of short conversations between rochester and jane each of them beautifully staged but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other we know that they are supposed to fall in love but we never see it actually happen the scene in which rochester wants to find out jane s reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded mason has left the house is completely missing and the farewell scene the most important scene the climax of the novel is reduced to four sentences zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for bront s superb lines neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out what remains is just a glimpse of the novel which does no justice to charlotte bront s masterpiece the cast is a mixed bag while fiona shaw is an excellent mrs reed anna paquin s young jane is more an ill mannered pout lolita than a lonely little girl longing for love the ever reliable joan plowright makes a very likable but far too shrewd mrs fairfaix and one cannot help feeling that billie whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain looking hard working grace poole charlotte gainsbourgh as the grown up heroine however is physically a perfect choice for playing jane eyre looking every bit like thin and frail with irregular strong features she comes closest to my inner vision of jane than any other actress in that role and during the first minutes of her screen time i was enchanted by her performance gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask but unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of jane s character any further as a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues gainsbourgh s portrayal of jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory this is a pity as with a better script charlotte gainsbourgh might have been as good a jane as zelah clarke in the version but while it is still obvious that gainsbourgh is trying to play jane there is no trace whatsoever of rochester in the character that william hurt portrays hurt who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies must have been aware that he was physically and type wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the rochester of the novel his rochester besides being blond and blue eyed is a soft spoken well mannered nobleman shy and quiet slightly queer and eccentric but basically good natured and mild he is so far from being irascible moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous additionally during many moments of the movie hurt s facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open if you compare his rochester to the strong willed and charming protagonist of the novel simply bursting with energy and temperament it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in hurt s performance still he offends me less than the rochesters in the and versions and i would in general rank this jane eyre higher than these three other ones hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so whereas george c scott ciar n hinds and toby stephens thought they could but failed miserably and i d rather watch a character other than rochester than a rochester who is badly played and i d rather watch a jane eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today s couple in a starbucks caf of course this jane eyre is a failure but at least it is an inoffensive one which is more than one can say of the and adaptations i would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation you will not find jane eyre but at least you will find a beautifully made movie 
i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story good actors but mismatched and i would also say rushed it has been about years since i read the book as it was in school but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out therefore it doesn t fully make sense for example jane mr rochester have hardly spoken suddenly he is proposing marriage the actors don t have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story the actors are good but aren t given enough time to do this story justice i m sorry to say it but i didn t really enjoy this version the version with susanna york george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the bbc mini series version with zelah clarke timothy dalton in the main roles i love it so much i watch it regularly there is an abridged version which goes for mins or the full version for mins 
jane eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book the whole red room is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in in the book the red room is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane s life helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i m sure she was happy to die and leave early in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it 
i don t like using the word awful to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time effort talent and money is spent in its creation but zefferelli s attempt to adapt charlotte bront s novel jane eyre is a total waste of time the script is lacking in finesse and power everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms leaving little to the imagination the lead actors are woefully miscast clearly hired for their star names and the musical score drippy and dull charlotte gainsbourg and william hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all she is like a wet noodle worse even than joan fontaine who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion and william hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick joan plowright s mrs fairfax is like some disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out there is no mystery surrounding the story of rochester s first wife the role of the would be second wife played like a barbie doll by elle macphearson is an empty cipher fiona shaw a very great actress is completely wasted as jane s aunt mrs reed she would have been better cast as mrs fairfax only amanda root as jane s beloved school teacher evokes any authentic sympathy or believability i saw this version of jane eyre after viewing robert young s for british television made in starring ciaran hinds samantha morgan and gemma jones there is no comparison young s vital romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to zefferelli s wet squib i will be interested now to see the version with timothy dalton about which i ve read some very good things on this web site i am amazed at how many people liked zefferelli s yorkshire picture book about all i can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored beyond that it is a complete dud 
this version is pretty insipid i m afraid jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood but william hurt s weary throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt i also can t believe that they eliminated edward s great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book one of the most moving moments in literature i do appreciate that they finally used such a young plain woman to play jane a character who is supposed to be a worldly but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel please see the s version with george c scott and susannah york york was too old tall and pretty to play jane but no one has touched rochester s character the way that scott did 
what made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to charlotte bronte s brilliance of the original classic story i was deeply disappointed to find that this movie which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful much of the witty back and forth between the main characters jane eyre and mr rochester seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor also missing was jane eyre s charismatic sense of self which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all the original jane eyre was a hero the woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over including one of the greatest parts of the story when jane runs away from thornfield and mr rochester her struggle to find food and shelter her shame at having to beg for bread the threat of freezing to death in the cold all to get away from a man she loved were in my opinion poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie the title character seemed dry and uninspired the story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book i cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting the screenplay and direction did little if any credit to the classic story 
i can t say this is the worst film of all time but only because there are still some movies i haven t seen yet this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time the director suffers from the same issues he had with there will be blood though he wasn t quite as bad in that film the whole movie it feels like you re watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities it s like he sits in his little director s chair and thinks how would a great filmmaker handle this scene he just doesn t have it in him i don t know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished but nothing was brought to ripen the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history one by one as we see the characters singing and i squirmed in my seat i kept saying please please just don t have the guy on the brink of death singing too sure enough massive failure 
this ambitious film suffers most from writer director paul thomas anderson s delusions of grandeur highly derivative of much better material altman s nashville lumet s network this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere a couple of misguided detours along the way an embarrassing musical interlude a biblical plague don t help matters neither does the uneven level of performances especially bad william h macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore for her unconvincing angst and how many times must we see john c reilly s sad sack shtick chicago and the hours will suffice tom cruise comes off well by comparison his misogynist foul mouthed holy roller was rather amusing speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with f bombs they lost their impact in no time don t even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann her extended rendition of one a maudlin number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time i d been pushed to the brink of hell one redeeming feature which i haven t seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia the damaged coke fiend bent on self destruction her credibility exceeded all others by far this film took itself way too seriously and just didn t know when to end 
 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray first they sent us to eyes wide shut then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year what is it about who the heck knows its full of self indulgence and loaded with bad acting i always like to stay and watch the credits but when this thing was over i couldn t get out of the movie theatre fast enough most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at felt pretty much the same way dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers it s an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful 
sorry did i miss something did i walk out early the first ten minutes of unusual and untrue stories had me thinking this is going to be a classic but it was all down hill from there the acting was brilliant for what it s worth william h macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in but it never seemed to connect i was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly it rains frog it was if the writer said i ve gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely oh sod it i ll just have it raining frogs i like clever movies i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring 
i can t tell you how angry i was after seing this movie the characters are not the slightest bit interesting and the plot is non existant so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other hoping that the past and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish what do we get a storm of frogs now yes i understand the references to the bible exodus and the underlying theme but first of all it was presented with absolutely no resolution and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible a significant portion of the population or charles fort a still larger portion as a somewhat well read person i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode don t waste your time it would be better spent reading well anything to be honest
this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children s comic i gave it out of for it s attention to detail because for the most part it had a s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make up was good this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally usually seen in one of their biographies no interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any biographers of those people in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the supposedly biographical book as for actually learning something that no one knew about the program and wasn t common knowledge well that never happened 
this movie is like real life by which i mean not a lot happens in the available hours or so and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast their invisibility being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers a big bore no big surprise that altman helms this he is a very variable performer yes we all loved gosford park but pret a porter anyone kansas city dr t and the women aaargh but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film and no it is not so bad it s good it s just bad 
i happened to love the show growing up along with millions of others so i tuned in to this movie thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun wrong i just have to wonder at the end of this was charlie s angels really that boring i don t seem to remember it as such but this movie as bad as movies of this type can be bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show i did see it all in spite of the negatives it wasn t unwatchable but it was very bland which i do not fault the performers for at all particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them the movie just wasn t that interesting it tried to make each angel a character one angel is to feisty one is the good girl one is to into her husband all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes the excitement of the show was missing and the dialog was dialog that s pretty much it not awful not the worst of tv movies but missable 
sadly this is not the best british gore film since hellraiser though the dvd cover claims this which is what tricked me into buying it it is however an homage to many of the great horrors of old films from most notably the amicus stable cradle is shot on mini dv which though we all know has more of a tv feel than a movie can be done so much better every scene set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way standard key fill rear setup which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece the gore content is quite frankly laughable from the opening shots where we see a man s obviously foam rubber head torn apart through to tacky cheap prop hammers the creature effects and the terrible cg there was nothing in there that impressed me at all the acting is abominable from the near comatose detective to the brummie dwarf via dani filth the least convincing horror movie bad guy i have ever witnessed each of the substories is more formulaic than the last and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs look out for the mental asylum a georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside and the most bizarre and not in a good way padded cell i have seen it took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering nay running away at any available opportunity i actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running it does however mark one of the last known appearances of emily booth s breasts which i guess is one um two things it has going for it once that s out of the way though it is all downhill i ve heard people say good things about alex chandon and i would love to believe them but on this evidence i m not likely to if you want a decent homage to amicus avoid this and go for the league of gentlemen christmas special instead currently battling it out with blair witch book of shadows for the title of worst film i have ever seen 
it surprisingly had a plot i ve seen movies with less plot i don t wanna mention asian movies but i thought the camera wasn t bad at all for a cheap movie like this and also the atmosphere wasn t too bad there is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens although i do think that about a lot of movies in this case it was horrible of course it ripped off some movies so badly just for single scenes the acting was bad but i ve seen worse the movie was bad but i ve seen worse watching this film is an experience between boredom laughing fits death wish sadism horniness and entertainment on a low level so if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you i gave it because it can be entertaining if you don t expect to see a good movie and you re in the right mood 
the directors cut version which was the one i saw was very long for this type of movie almost two hours is way too long if you have the choice definitely go for the non directors cut the main plot is almost not taken up at all the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes which are connected but the feeling is that they re only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there as a horror movie it doesn t work you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition character is presented minutes later character is dead this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part 
this movie has a few things going for it right off the bat having dani filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie admittedly i love cradle of filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before i watched it dani filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead the independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor there are some gorgeous actresses in this movie for being low budget the special effects weren t bad either the ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish now on to the cons there is very little talking throughout this whole movie thus making for very little as far as character development it s hard to fear for the lives of limp static characters when there was a little talking the f bomb was abundant popping up in random places yes i understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language the storyline what i could make out of it was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what s happening in the end cradle of fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline it just doesn t work too well rent it though if you re a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite 
this movie was made for fans of dani and cradle of filth i am not one of them i think he s just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon still i m generally not a fan of black metal but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it i convinced myself that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing thus i assumed i m in for a roller coaster ride of rubber gore and do it yourself splatter with a sinister background now that is what i do like i got home and popped it in my patience lasted minutes awful camera work and disgusting quality and that was then that it looked like it was shot using a hi camcorder i left it on the shelf maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this picture after a couple of months i got back to it in mentioned surroundings and saw half then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me my disliking evolved i noticed how funny dani m height looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart yes ripping his head apparently had no skull i also found that this movie may have no sense still i haven t finished it yet so i wasn t positive after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick a couple of months back yes it took me years so dani in fact was funny as satan manson super evil man s helper and the movie did not make sense see our bad person employs dani to do bad things he delivers why well i guess he s just very very bad as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it we have a couple of short stories joined by dani s character my favourite was about a guy who steals someone s leg because he wants to use it as his own yeah exactly the acting s rock bottom the cgi is the worst ever i mean stinger beats it and boy is stinger s cgi baaaaad the story has no sense and the quality is let s just say it is not satisfying the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore blood and guts are made pretty well why you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on example dani the man filth takes a stuffed cat fake as can be and guts it and then eats what fell out why we never know we do know however that this cat must have been on illegal substances as his heart is almost half his size you might think after my comment that this movie is so bad it s good but it s just bad cradle of filth fans can add points i added one for gore 
this film is a very funny film the violence is bad the acting is well dani stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually frustrated goth lads in personally i think this movie really does suck the story and characters could be very good if say the directing the actors and other little nibby things were made better but the film is just bad the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it this film is possibly the worst b rate film ever and believe me that s hard to achieve especially when you re competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for serious horror movies i m not a cof fan and so i just see this as another rubbish movie a really bad one if dani made this as a comedy then good going him very well done over than that though i rate it low for it s crappiness watch it when you re in a happy happy joy joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you re high on multiple different types of drugs 
check out the film s website more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie it couldn t be more off in it s boasting original story original they must have found the script tucked away between the old testament or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn tooting high end special effects come on i could do better with an atari and a jug of earwax stylish cinematography oh yes the america s funniest home video look is still a classic i m sure they had little money available for this title so of course the sf aren t really that good or a bit bad now and then or just plain hilarious but it s the story that makes this film a waste of time and money stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen befores and done already s 
i didn t know if i would laugh or cry seeing this only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this this is supposed to be a horror movie but there s only filth in this the most cool scene is the car accident with real special effects from the best of hollywood avoid this movie at all costs see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie 
lage raho munnabhai is really a disappointing movie i have seen the first part of munnabhai and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u this movie really waste yours time and money i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema hall role of circuit was very small n useless n this movie i think sanjay dutt cut down the role of arshad varshi character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one this movie show u the result of over confidence the ideas of mahatma is also not define and confusing a really very big disappointment
the reason i intended to give this movie a chance to take hours of my life actually it was only minutes was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema all i have ever seen were few older movies of s ray browsing through imdb i came across this one and after seeing rating of i concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment oh my how wrong i was the only logical explanation for this rating of is that most of people who voted are indian and their only venture outside bolliwood production were adam sandler movies with this rating this movie would be ranked on th place on imdb list of best movies above citizen cane goodfellas of psycho i am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that i find worth remembering from this painful experience my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu who like me find this movie as is plain stupid with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music 
let s see where to begin bad acting i m not sure if i d even call it that as it more along the lines of a no effort script read the actors didn t even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless sure there was a scene or two with nudity but that couldn t save this movie from it s lifeless characters to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants budget did this movie even have a budget it seemed like they used less money than i ve seen in a home shot youtube video bad lighting props poor sound post production bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so but there was no life to this flick i don t care who directed it i ve seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom don t waste your time or you ll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review check the ratings you ll see the s are rapidly outpacing the fluffed s with hardly anything in between wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time what a suck fest 
this is a film that makes you say things i can do much better than this acting writing and directing this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others looks as if it was shot with my flip video i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film one of the worst movies i have ever seen hopefully the writers and director leave the business not even talented enough to do commercials 
a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of james hetfield s slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think `why am i watching this that question will be coursing through your minds in minutes after you hit play i gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or watching just my opinion 
i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel so invariably my expectations were crushed but they were crushed more than should be expected the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand which perhaps ruined it for me in any event for some reason they changed the labor camp at toulon to a ship full of galley slaves the scene at bishop myriel s was fine in fact other than the galleys things survived up until the dismissal of fantine because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman she does not cut her hair sell her teeth or become a prostitute the worst she does is run into the mayor s office and spit on his face bamatabois is entirely eliminated because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about tholomyes is fantine s dead husband rather than an irresponsible dandy valjean is able to fetch cosette for fantine before the champmathieu affair so they reunite happily yet another change then comes the convent which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up thankfully it was saved after this three minutes of accuracy however the movie again begins to hurtle towards classic novel butchering as cosette and valjean are riding through the park they come across marius giving a speech at a meeting about prison reform when he comes to hand out fliers to valjean and cosette he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set we aren t revolutionaries i could hear victor hugo thrashing in his grave of course they are revolutionaries they want to revolt against the pseudo monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic you dumb screenwriters it s a historical fact that there was an insurrection against the government in at one point cosette goes to give marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets eponine except not eponine or at least not the eponine of the book this eponine appears to be a well to do secretary girl working for the prison reformers who are working out of the cafe universal as opposed to the cafe musain not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not period low cut tight fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms the prison reformers lead by the most poorly cast enjolras that i have ever seen decide that handing out pamphlets isn t good enough anymore so they re going to build barricades i don t know about you but i have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops about three hundred people it was not supposed to be so many start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of barricades etc eponine does die for marius thankfully the rest of the movie is sort of accurate except that javert s suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation the movie ends with valjean watching javert jump into the river this is again inaccurate because valjean would never have let javert drown he saved the man s life earlier why let him die now then there s the whole skipping of valjean s confession to marius his deterioration and his redemption on his deathbed with marius and cosette by his side overall i can blame the script mostly for the problems while i am glad enjolras and eponine were at least present in the film they were terribly misinterpreted as was the entire barricade scene the elimination of fantine s suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her that cosette knows valjean s past from the start messes with the plot a good deal i did not even see thenardier and mme thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time the same with gavroche i did like frederich march s interpretation of valjean a lot however which was one of the redeeming features of the movie on the other hand charles laughton for all his great acting in other movies seems to have missed the mark with javert the lip tremble the unnecessary shouting and his acting in general all just felt very wrong he also like many javerts i have seen did not appear at all menacing something required of the character again this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book i would not recommend it to book purists though i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate french version come out the year before 
i just finished a marathon of this series and it became agonising to watch as it progressed from the fictionalising of the historical elements to o herlihy s awful accent in later episodes the show just slumps the further it goes if you are looking for some low quality production generalised ww fluff then i could recommend season but avoid anything after that it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility the old b w film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name attached to it and even that is not what one could hope for 
what the hell of a d movie was that bad acting bad special effects and the worst dialogues storyline i ever came across the only cool thing here was coolio who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop however the rest of the film is awful and boring it s not even so bad you can laugh about it just plain crap and whoever compares this to the evil dead series might as well compare tomb raider to indiana jones well ok at least there was angelina jolie in tomb raider out of 
this movie is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen from the very first scene i knew it would be a smash crash it starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission as it turns out the people in it were possessed by some random zombies well some years later some college kids are pulling some pledge prank horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non chalonte manner with pledge over reacting and over doing the whole eager to be popular role what really took the cake with this one is the final battle absolutely horrible special effects with the guns for example guns making a noise with no muzzle flash and vice versa this is accompanied by stop animation zombies why they move in stop motion is a mystery cheesy music and about guns that come out of nowhere overall this movie is crap just like so many others you can rent for cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place 
this film wasn t programmed in italian cinemas i have seen it at a manifestation called fantafestival i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there s no suspence in the film music is completely out of the story and i don t have words to describe the visual effects if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busy the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review 
in fact these young people were so distasteful that i couldn t wait for all of em to get slaughtered and that includes clarissa joanna canton since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background it had nowhere to go but down even the prosthetics looked fake and the blood looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch although later on it took on red day glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing i m sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh t since it ll appeal to that bunch it sure didn t appeal to me blah and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself she still looks hot though i m glad she takes care of herself since we don t get to see too much of her nowadays however it is a step up from dante tomaselli s meandering horror in that it has a somewhat coherent plot so i ll give it that much that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film lion s gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up out of 
when i tell people that i review movies as a hobby the first thing they say is what do you think of such and such movie there are a couple of problems here firstly there is the probable chance that i ve not seen it and thus i ruin my reputation secondly i could trash the movie in question without realising that it s actually their favourite lastly i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion thus i find myself sat before the convent which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here more s the pity because this frankly dreadful horror is about as scary as a box of kittens following well worn clich s the convent focuses on a bunch of american high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned laid and mildly spooked but you ll never guess what happens next a group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition will any of them survive and more importantly haven t you got better things to worry about the only thing that saves the convent from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of coolio s bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger it s far too amusing to be properly frightening the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason the day glo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered but even if they were trying i still doubt that it would work demonic nuns wearing the sort of make up you d see in the buffy the vampire slayer tv show aren t really that scary the scariest thing about this movie really is that over of voters gave this a maximum score i mean i know it s funny but i hardly split my sides to be honest i ve had more fun in a dentist the convent isn t really a horror movie as such it s more of a comedy horror like scary movie or shaun of the dead but you re laughing at it instead of with it i honestly can t recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then i doubt very much they d enjoy it i don t enjoy the so bad that it s good genre i personally feel that if the film makers can t be bothered to salvage a turkey then i shouldn t bust a gut trying to watch it yes it s a bad film and yes they really should have gone home and done something more constructive a rubik s cube for example the dvd box has two price stickers one for and a reduced price of but it was sold for and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy cheap awesomely bad flick sorry if you do like it but the convent really is a pile of unholy crap 
i thought that this movie was pretty lame if you re looking for cheesey you may like this i myself don t mind a fair amount of cheese but this was ridiculous the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak the only thing entertaining about this movie was the day glo zombies but even that isn t reason enough to see this flick 
i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great so i went out and bought it what a mistake the acting is a shambles the special effects if you could call them that look like something that wouldn t be out of place at a school play some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen which unfortunately is all to often as for a story forget it this is a warning don t waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen if for some reason you like this film watch troll you will probably enjoy that as well 
this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be i dread to think what the blockbuster approved edit must have looked like because the director s cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions naturally you don t expect it to be the godfather but an acting class or two might have come in handy also there were so many cute guys in this movie but they were woefully under exploited i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy but even i have a right to expect a little more it wasn t a total loss though at least we got a peek a drew fuller s covered junk and truly upsetting haircut and there s huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in bring it on and acting about as well there s always a silver lining kids you just have to look really hard for it and occasionally you have to make use of your pause button 
this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous and i have never seen such bad acting in my life the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys especially drew fuller i don t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie i didn t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch i was very disappointed the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion 
if you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one a setting and acting as in a porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind which actually becomes very boring after minutes of touchy feely but no action a few of the actors i ve seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better all the special effects are done by the great rondo whom performs all the magic whit his mind a cult movie is written on the box does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving 
pros nothing cons everything plot summary a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies review never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles filmed on a budget of what looks to be about bucks tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame forgetable actors whom couldn t act to save their lives and gore that s more gross than frightening how does a movie like this even get made simply put avoid tzc like a sexually transmitted disease my last cents humorously enough this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films they re brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this my rating out of if it were up to me this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion 
you can t hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days and i had expected it to be campy anyway it s not all that campy in reality with the exception of kevin kalisher and huntley ritter who don t take themselves seriously the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight riley smith is exceptionally bad the ridiculous story is actually paid attention to which kind of shocked me i assumed the whole purpose with these ultra low budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story but they use lots of words like technological and physicality in the script to get their point across although it s possible that the story is important only to explain why there s so few cast members nobody cares about this stupid storyline and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft core homoeroticisms which aren t all that edgy i would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason the film is grainy with a tv quality look and acting level there are a few sexy scenes that are alright the boys writhing in bed in their boxers feeling themselves up or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them and some of them are kinda funny and i liked the digs at l ron hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones but it still isn t any good 
i have been reading the reviews for this movie and now i wanna kill my self i don t wanna live in a world where people find this move or rob schneider funny what is wrong with these people i m not angry at rob schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat i watched this film in disbelief who would pay money to make this this film is so bad that its painful most bad films are funny because they are crap the animal is just disgusting watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self we don t need you i want to raise money to get rob scheider off all movies if someone killed rob schneider they should be given a nobel peace prize 
guy is a loser can t get girls needs to build up is picked on by stronger more successful guys etc seen it saw it moved on i d have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life and get out of the adam sandler plots there are two funny parts in the whole movie i couldn t even finish the last minutes i was getting bored the animal is an alright film i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot but this was trying too hard to impress the jokes are very old so trust me this is not a film that most people could really get into but some did so i ll be nice 
redundant but again the case if you enjoy the former snl comedian and his antics in this case schneider then you should go basic comedy man s life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him unfortunately he takes on each animal s characteristics former survivor colleen looks pretty good here now that she doesn t have open sores on her legs and a little makeup on her face d
i was expecting a movie similar to deuce bigalow which i enjoyed however this dud seemed to last forever it s one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg while not being kid appropriate the jokes aren t just low brow or f t jokes they re crude lewd and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg rating too bad it might have made a bigger splash as an r rated film if the funny was left in overstatement probably i do not recommend this movie it is a full on waste of time and i m a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot at minutes in the movie felt like it should be winding down and boy were we ready for it to the ending is quaint but doesn t salvage the rest of this quagmire tourist trap of a rental star glad i saw it as a freebie would have been sickened to pay hard earned greenbacks for this tripe 
ain t it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way that formula never gets old does it it s such a sure fire way to make a classic film just look at major hits like liar liar and big this must have been rob schneider s line of thinking when he made semi successful deuce bigalow male gigolo and followed it with the animal since i ve already traced the plot through sarcasm allow me to color it in more schneider plays a loser cop who s suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times run like a cheetah etc this movie is slightly more likable than other schneider starring flicks such as another lame same plot follow up the hot chick but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality tv star as the romantic lead colleen haskell from survivor and inserting a cameo by norm macdonald my favorite scene just does not exist sorry nothing memorably good except the production value i just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way you can do it there s a word for that milking actually here s another word cheap 
i believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles zvezda barely does the first zvezda being a russian war film i was expecting patriotism sentimentality beautiful poetic pictures a lush score slavic cheekbones and cruel germans what i didn t need was the naive love non affair the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references stalinism nazism holocaust only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about liberating poland a missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently 
dreary schlocky just plain dreadful and awful let s be honest when you sit down to watch something called the double d avenger you aren t expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts you don t get really either of these in the video the story as it consistent with most of these types is inane kitten natividad runs a local pub finds out she has breast cancer flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super human abilities giver returns and fights dressed as the double d avenger a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition as stories go i have seen a lot worse but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous the action sequences lack zip drive motivation and are tissue thin the acting isn t even properly campy and the dialog is the pits nothing and i mean nothing is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy handed boob references all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it but they all fall way short kitten haji and raven de la croix are all quite older still lovely in their own ways yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be older campy caricatures of their former selves instead they look so lame and desperate more because of the vehicle they are starring in rather than their own abilities there are some other lovely ladies but you really do not see much of anything pg definitely could be an appropriate rating for this the material the actresses and director are all tired tiresome and dated and again not funny it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun the guy playing bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me not that he was good at all mind you but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr sci fi himself forrest j ackerman play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax frankenstein affectionately called frankie other than that this is a complete bust now how is that for another tired dreadful trite pun 
this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen i have to disagree with another commenter who said the special effects were okay i found them pretty bad it just wasn t realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story the archaeologists are looking for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt if you re shooting a movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert the beginning the ancient ceremony looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert the action level was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax it made the movie look short and that s certainly a pro for this particular movie 
i make a point out of watching bad movies frequently and the sci fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find as such i m sure you can imagine my disappointment when i saw sands of oblivion the acting was uncharacteristically sub par as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci fi usually has in store for us there are a few cameos made by people you d most likely recognize although you may not know their names by heart the cgi special effects are minimal and as such one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci fi feature is lacking sure there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he s known for a couple of days but overall it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter and i consider that a major disappointment if i was rating it on a star scale made specifically to judge made for tv movies i d probably give it a maybe even a a real shame that i may have to wait till the next sci fi original movie to get a good laugh and i really hope that this movie isn t part of some overall quality increase in sci fi original movies 
tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the s during the filming of demille s first version of the commandments and which is reawakened when demille s sets are unearthed in the desert one of the worst films i ve seen in a long time the question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons you will laugh long and hard at this film probably more than many other hollywood comedies 
watching the first minutes of sands of oblivion gave me high hopes it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy the setup was promising in the s cecil b demille makes his opus of the ten commandments it seems in using real egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil don t they always aware of what had been unleashed demille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site the movie s first mistake but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a sci fi channel movie the first sightings we get of the anubis monster are well done and it s a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy cg effect then the body counts starts this is were the movie went south for me the reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do they make the usual stop to the guy who knows the truth but never told anyone after getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site no they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk really i m not the most motivated person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me i d put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the anubis monster in the usual way by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it s standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades for a sci fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out which isn t saying much at all what disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it 
while the idea is more original than most sci fi movies the execution is as usual lacking while the practical mummy effects are not bad and the gun nut character is over the top giggle inducing the only real draw is to see morena baccarin and adam baldwin reunited on the small screen i suspect that was the idea all along they do the best they can with what they have but the must see moments for me were in the first minutes or so when morena s character sported some tomb raider style shorts not high brow cinema i know but you can t deny true beauty when you see it and adam baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate if you just want to watch a couple of your favorite firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you if you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere 
reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high a big budget tons of popular faces a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves the end result is a disaster alice tremblay s supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it s audience i didn t hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation going through it s page thin story line and one dimensional characters without a single spark not a sign of the magic it wished it had the minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn t seem that great an idea on the set let alone on paper l odyss e d alice tremblay is a collage of comic sketches linked together with a very thin layer of good ideas avoid or boredom will haunt you 
this movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet it made the rm sons of provo look like well done films it was supposed to be funny from what i was told the best part was the best actor in the movie travis eberhard if he wasn t in the movie it probably wouldn t have been made he ruled it wasn t funny it was beat it had thurl big t bailey who s character made no sense it was made in provo it didn t make fun of brokeback it had larry h miller in it it was the st movie clint howard wasn t funny in gary coleman chose the perfect movie a comeback they should have cast at surreal life auditions it was made by halestorm entertainment 
well i suppose the good news concerning william winckler s opus the double d avenger is that it manages to unite three of russ meyer s mammarian marvels kitten natividad haji and raven de la croix in one picture i can only assume that lorna maitland tura satana and babette bardot were busy the week they shot this thing or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance the bad news though and there s plenty of it is that this film if it can even be called that having been shot straight to video is a complete misfire a total abortion an out and out atrocity an absolute abomination and truly one of the worst pictures that i have ever seen look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made the plot here such as it is deals with kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in south america to cure her breast cancer oy and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in l a too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely you should pardon the expression flat that there is zero actual nudity in the film at all other than some old photos of kitten in her heyday and that some shaving cream and a papier mache boulder are the sum total of the special fx the meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth saggy in the chest to put it kindly although sheri dawn thomas as bikini girl ooga boobies does manage to uh stand out nicely so why have i given this juvenile unfunny failed embarrassment of a movie stars instead of to be succinct joe bob briggs his voice over commentary in the special features of the dvd i just watched is absolutely hilarious especially when he pulls out around synonyms for the word breast from the on his web site s canonical hooters list the man is a national treasure and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status 
this movie is a total dog i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn t feel like i d totally wasted my money and my time the writing in this film is absolutely terrible it s a shame it s not up to the standards of other hale storm movies they should have saved the money on getting d list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right even gary coleman wasn t properly utilized for his role this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was including the subplots after viewing this movie i m left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite like humor where it s not so much the lines as the character and the delivery unfortunately this movie fails to deliver the lines the characters the delivery or the humor i should have gone to the dentist instead 
first of all let me say the i am lds or rather i am a mormon so when i watched this film i automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt i can usually find something redeeming in every movie i watch and this one was no exception it does have its redeeming moments but they are few and far between one of the first things i noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though halestorm was ashamed of our church in the lds church congregations are called wards and the basketball court is in the cultural hall never once are either of these two names mentioned the church is never referred to by name and the standards is as far as it goes in mentioning what our church believes it makes me wonder if the directors are really lds or lds wannabes this film had so much potential it could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer but also what we believe instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired if i were not already lds i d be left thinking mormons are stupid idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs it is not a film i will recommend to my nonlds friends sorry halestorm you can do better than this 
every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie how great will be my joy where to begin my discussion of pain for starters there was a musical montage every five minutes there was no character development every character was a stereotype we had swearing guy fat guy who eats donuts goofy foreign guy etc the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation have the directors producers etc ever even seen a movie before halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry the concept for this movie sounded so funny how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors but trust me when i say this things went wrong very wrong 
i was not expecting much going in to this but still came away disappointed this was my least favorite halestorm production i have seen i thought it was supposed to be a comedy but i only snickered at or jokes is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over what was up with the janitor in heaven scene fred willard has been hilarious with some of his christopher guest collaborations but this did not work they must have spent all the budget on getting known actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget it looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket i try not to be too critical of low budget comedies but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie 
wow what can i say i like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance lorenzo lamas pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy has as much acting ability as bill clinton has self control it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse crazed hillbilles yep needless tit shot with a real weird scar yep crappy soundtrack yep i wish i could give the movie stars but is as low as it goes seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real the worse thing there is more snake eater movies guess its in demand 
first of all i became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes cause of the bas screenplay i don t think this movie has any purpose it s boring from the first minute to the last i don t understand why this movie scores so high i gave it but actually it s not more wurth then 
i go to the cinema to be entertained there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film from beginning to end there is no respite from the gray grinding reality of this woman s life it is one paced with no change of mood i remained until the end only because i was convinced that things must get better they don t and i don t think i was the only one as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close honestly depicting social depravation is no crime but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public a dreadful film 
hard to describe this one if you were a fan of russ meyer films back in the day you will surely be pleased to see that haji is still looking really hot though forry ackerman has not fared so well what is he doing still making these movies anyway if i go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie it was a pretty fun premise a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length and the jokes were on a level with your average joe e brown comedy or abbott and costello if that s your thing basically just bad puns still i found this movie fascinating to watch and for more than reasons good job but still a fundamentally flimsy production 
if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease inducing dogme style i would never have rented it nevertheless i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot i lasted a very very very long forty minutes before giving up it s just boring pretentious twaddle the last french movie i saw was romance and it too was pretty dismal but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme overseas it ll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy it s called dogme because that s the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera 
i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm d or at the cannes film festival because it was atrocious i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldn t believe that someone would make such a worthless film there is nothing interesting about the plot the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects also if you do decide to waste hours of your life by watching this film be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand held camcorder and half the time you can t even see the main subjects this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as blair witch because it creates suspense in rosetta there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything i should have known better when it came on at o clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible 
i hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input i know they re going for realism but to be frank i just don t want realism realism is boring if i want to see daily life i ll uhm live tell me an interesting story and we ll talk i can deal with the low production values hell i m a sucker for low production values but at least work in some good ideas the direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit but obviously i m supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out i can only conclude this is not drama not by a long shot we get to see rosetta walking to someplace rosetta working in a bakery rosetta eating a waffle rosetta carrying around bags of far rosetta walking back home rosetta walking someplace it s just not that entertaining there isn t really a deeper meaning either i got so bored i started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it s just plain realism the most overrated quality in the business i guess i m supposed to love this but come on there s nothing in there 
this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television the house mates are dull uninteresting ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain dead morons whatever happened to television that didn t target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience this cannot be classified as entertainment i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul it happened to rove mcmanus who was once a respectable comedian and once moving to channel become horribly unfunny with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made 
if there was a stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste the fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse the basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine but wheres the experiment all i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i don t know or want to know about the challenges are pathetic and silly the whole point of reality tv is to show reality if you set a challenge don t make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in friday night games make them do an actual challenge and as for earning prize money thats fine if they actually earnt it these people are nuts if only they would make the show better the actual idea would be glorious but that ain t gonna happen 
i bought this movie from gamestop s discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so i bought it for cents the movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey the director more than likely committed a murder suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent warner bros film and he ended up owing money to the studio it also doesn t help that he wasn t even infamous for the terrible job he did he wasn t even known for producing a poop chute film why was this movie ever made 
i watched this a few days ago so details are getting hazy the film is shot on hand held cameras and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally since we hadn t had many studio pictures made in this way i can t help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn t had all the compromises that come with a big budget and so was more real however what we have here isn t much more than a not as good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket so anyone who has seen that or any one of the other rip offs there of will know what to expect the main problem i had was the stereotyped characters with the weedy soft kids out of their depth close harmony singing ebonics spouting black dudes world weary sergeants bitter and twisted psychos etc etc all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation maybe it was laziness or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience all i know is it was annoying one novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it this seems to be the main pivot of the plot with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way the other big bug i had was how all the characters with the exception of the psychos and the real softies would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence faced with farrell s ubiquitous stoicism immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads which was strong and very convincing tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters this wasn t too hard in my imagination bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duty and for my money episodes of that would be more fun to watch 
ouch they don t come much worse than this horrid adaptation of c s lewis s beloved novel while the adaptation is very true to the novel the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play i ve read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the bbc has ever given at the time but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the that it looks like this was filmed for the worst effect of all is mr beaver i know computer effects weren t at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role avoid this at all costs 
this movie is terrible but it has some good effects 
i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin being a devout fan of lewis carroll s alice books i was very excited about this movie s premier which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch normally i m enthusiastic about modern re tellings if they are treated well usually it s interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion the adaptation of the original s characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying it probably didn t help that the actors weren t very good either most performances were ridiculously over the top which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by really the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfman s work also i d have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance off was awful it was with out a doubt the low point of the film what a joke don t see this movie after its conclusion i was genuinely angry 
a friend once told me that an art house independent film ran in a cinema when upon the closing of the film audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats of course my imagination ran amok trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work well now my imagination can be put to rest i am a lifelong andrei tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work i have come across many people who thought tarkovsky s films are slow moving and inert opinions being what they are i found this not to be true of the late director s wonderful works which are wrought with meaning beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions upon hearing aleksandr sokurov called the heir to tarkovsky i was excited to experience his films with the exception of the open air ride through the fields stalker this movie has no kinship to anything tarkovsky has done it does not seem to possess the slightest meaning even on a completely mindless level it s supposedly gorgeously stark cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft there is a no balance no proportion and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow the main character is so inept and indecisive it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner i am also not adverse to non plots or story lines that progress on multiple non linear fashion but there isn t even a non story here one must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost as hair pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a tarkosky time sculpture look as if jerry bruckheimer had filmed a charlie chaplin short i won t rule out that this may be one of sokurov s stinkers tarkovsky s solaris but to conclude that he is one of tarkovsky s heir based on this film would be to call paris hilton the successor to aristotle c mon guys don t be afraid to say it no amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life i don t profess to fully understand russian culture and i probably don t have russian values but i immediately picked up on tarkovsky s work as something magical a treasure and a gift to viewers if it didn t have sokurov s name on it and it aired on say saturday night live i m pretty sure nobody would read all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick 
 this contains many many spoilers not that it matters since everything is so patently obvious oh my god where do i start well here this is the first time i have ever come home from a movie and said i have to get on imdb and write a review of this now it is my civic duty such is the badness of this flick begin digression but let me just state one thing before i start i m not some harvard art major film noir weenie in fact i went to the college at the other end of mass ave in cambridge the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go which should put me squarely in the nerd who would obsessively love comic book films census group and still i hated this film my viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the die hards bond flicks clerks and the grail i wish the titanic had never sunk not so much for the lives lost but so we wouldn t have been subjected to that dung heap of a film and the single and only reason i will watch a snooty french art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed emmanuelle beart in it i even gave maximum overdrive one of its precious few s here on imdb for god s sake so i m as shallow as they come therefore i m not criticizing this film because i m looking for some standard of cinematic excellence it s because elektra stinks like a three week old dead goat end digression ok there s so much badness here that i have to try to categorize it here goes ms garner one of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot jgar i have no idea why my wife wanted to i think that between this and finding nemo the latter was the sexier film you know the red outfit she s advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see you see her in it twice once at the beginning once at the end bummer in the rest she basically looks like what morrissey would look like if he were a female lots of pouting and black clothes which brings me to the incredible range of expression jgar shows in her acting ranging from pouting all the way to pouting and crying oh my god you d think she was being forced to date ben affleck or something horrible like that um wait the bad guys gal they show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you d expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit at least next to jgar s performance it doesn t stand out too badly one guy s role is to stand there and be huge another s is to stand there and have stuff come out of him and the woman s role is to stand there and breathe on and or kiss people they manage to pull these incredible feats off the main bad guy has the most difficult role of all he has to simultaneously a appear angry and b appear asian he does a fine job at this i think there was a fifth bad guy gal but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self defense plot twists this movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the democratic national convention let s just put it this way my wife who has only been in the u s for half a year and speaks only a small amount of english whispered this to me when the girl first appears in jg s pad and i swear to god i am not making this up she go to house to kill girl and father too and this is before the father has even appeared on the screen now my wife isn t stupid but she isn t being courted by mensa for her gifts either and she s had zero exposure to daredevil or the comic book genre and she figured this out in seconds with no prodding and no prior information such is the blatant obviousness of this film rarely before seen stupidity ok so there s this big dude in the film he can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it s lint and he can take a vicious electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal or melt it or something more defenses kicking in thank god but jg jumps on his head and he explodes an achilles noggin ok such is the mind numbing stupidity of this film ack i m starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on so i have to stop but you have been warned if you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie do it and if armageddon is going to come please let it be before this comes out on dvd 
perhaps i m out of date or just don t know what electra is like in current publications but the electra that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way this movie was fairly weak on the dialog the acting wasn t particularly convincing and the action was spotty i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank miller s book electra assassin which is much darker than anything in this movie special effect where cool action was interesting at times but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical tha hand was not menacing enough and electra was not bitchy enough she s the girl you love to hate but in this story i just didn t care either way 
this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film it was a big wannabee it wanted to be an edgy nervous laughter urban life affirming film but it s more of a camera jerky mess it s a lot easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters from the beginning i couldn t care less about the characters or what they were involved in they were always always hitting pissing or crying on each other only there wasn t any substance to what they were doing the dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so i could be wrong 
i m irish and i ve been living in denmark for a while so i was looking forward to going home last week so i could see intermission and i will go on record as saying this film is awful it is not quite as bad a something like the most fertile man in ireland but it definitely does not stand up there with other irish films such as the commitments i went down or michael collins some aspects of the film are actually quite funny such as colm meaneys american style garda but the film itself is shot completely wrong the bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom in zoom out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama but it isn t this is an irish lock stock and two smoking barrels and it should be shot like this it should have smooth movement from one shot to the next the film just looks sloppy and thrown together the performances are okay given the awful script a friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed colin farrell around dublin for a week he gives a decent display as a dublin dirtbag but it no way compares to his performances in minority report tigerland or phone booth the best performance was from dierdre o kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman i think she should leave her god awful stand up and focus more on her acting all in all its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best irish films ever i m expecting a backlash from these comments because most people i have spoken to have said it was great but before you reply ask yourself would think so highly of this movie if it was set in england or america 
a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one it needed some dependence on something this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people were they trying to imitate the wonderful film crash if so this film crashed entirely there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem the film is just too choppy to work one woman loses her husband after years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance then we have losers who purchase masks to rob a bank obviously the robbery goes awry but there doesn t seem to be any punishment for the crooks perhaps the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film 
i live in ottawa where this film was made and i really wish it hadn t been this is one god awful flick i really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is indie films blow well this film does nothing to shed this curse the actor writer director brett kelly does little to contribute to the genre rather he re hashes tired clich s from movies past i am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting it s way too overdone i can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie as well for a movie that dares to call itself horror a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring the biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back not that this concept bugs me but i didn t really find it believable that when the two main characters both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other this is done in such a short time span that it s inconceivable my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her the last point that i have is and i won t hold this against kelly but the movie is shot entirely on boring emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat my only hope is that something happens to prevent brett kelly from making a sequel which has been reported on his website a sequel that was half written in one sitting lord help us all 
usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn t have a lower rating and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating this is not the case here bonesetter is a perfect example of a film it does nothing right and it doesn t have the chance to because it doesn t really attempt to do anything there are strands of a bad d d novel kind of plot which doesn t hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort because even a completely patently untalented persons hard work would amount to more a truly awful film 
i realise that the us army was demoralised by but this film was unbelievable it was supposed to be a training camp not the ss punishment battalion in a sven hassell novel the writer must be a real army hater the psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell and the useless black top sergeant should have been sacked as well these men were going overseas the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from and an investigation would have ensued the scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one farrell the alleged barrack room lawyer would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order to torture pows in contravention to the geneva convention actual assault on an enlisted man sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer intead he just walks away after this discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable i don t know how it ended i went to bed 
movie had some good acting and good moments though obviously pretty low budget but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed the main point of conflict between the two leads doesn t play out in a realistic manner at all there are a few scenes where they disagree because of it but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently especially since the employment of glenn is so wound up in this part of his life and adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money also several times glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is apologizing to adam for his past while adam is shown to be upstanding and traditional which the film proclaims to be the good way in the end i don t like being preached to like that i attended a discussion session with the director after viewing ltr and he said that he presented this conflict between them because if he was in glenn s shoes and he said he does in real life relate to glenn s view that he could never date someone with adam s views well then i think he should have done a much better job explaining how glenn could do it in the film also director said he directed this his first movie only after reading directing for dummies directing was not that bad but far from a top notch effort i ve seen worse but i rarely leave films feeling this frustrated 
when i saw that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film i was intrigued being a fan of the book i assumed she d be playing tony roz or charis but more so i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head y almost psychological but not psychological thriller novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn t read the novel and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had the book is a complex reflection of society women and modern life and i was interested to see how they used the different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film what they actually did was a crime the biggest error and confusing issue is why would oxygen a network that advertises as being for women take an amazing book about how complex wonderful and terrible women are and can be and change the protagonist from women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask roz tony and charis about how they knew zenia and in doing that they rushed through bulk of the book in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with in the film these women aren t people they are characters in the book zenia does fake her death but the book mentions it to get this point across while the film wastes minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or csi it turns out that mary louise parker played zenia which was so wrong zenia is a catherine zeta jones angelina jolie or maybe even a scarlett johnasson type she is a woman men can t not adore and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by but in a keep your enemies closer kind of way and once she gets closer she seems totally genuine and trust worthy despite your better judgment she s the kind of woman who even when she loses she wins she s always still beautiful still rich and there are always still people out there who don t know her game in the film zenia didn t take charis s man the blonde american draft dodger who was using charis in the first place but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies and zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with august but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed it s was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book but i think had i not read the book i would have spent the whole movie confused if i had bothered to stick with it at all and roz s husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture which was weird since zenia took roz s business and home life in the book which is why roz hated her so much and she and zenia had conspired to kill roz s husband years and years back and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever even at the party where zenia and west in the book had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it and evil bitchy person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it tony s character was so wrong in this film she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book the film basically implied smart women are evil beautiful women are evil powerful women are evil and women who teach yoga are off their rockers they basically tried to make it so zenia wasn t necessarily as awful as she was in the book and then in the end the three women convince this former cop who of course in the process of researching this meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to barbados or something ridiculous which of course zenia bails on to hide zenia s body which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony or they conspired together to do it and then zenia also managed to take all of roz s money in the process by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been if you aren t confused by this breakdown of the film then maybe you would like it because i have read the book and seen the movie and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused it was terrible i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task but if you are going to take on the task you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland are there really no fluffier books that oxygen could be making at least half decent tv movies of 
i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood s novel the robber bride and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder and his buddy an ex cop journalist tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman s crazy female friends it s fortunate that the movie script fixes ms atwood s clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men victims of scheming women heh okay you got me if these guys are mentioned in the book and i m pretty sure they re entirely made up for the movie i ll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy apparently the three main female characters of the novel aren t enough to carry the movie zenia s manipulations aren t interesting unless we see them happen to a man and a man s life is screwed up roz charis and toni tell their stories to a man because it s not important if a man doesn t hear them i liked the characters in the book it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man s story i normally do not look for feminist angles on media and i tried to enjoy the movie as is if i hadn t read the book i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more so if you like the cop and the ex cop and you want to read more about them you re out of luck read the novel if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot it s the same plot the movie excavated it ironed it and sprinkled it with male angst it s like zenia s revenge on margaret atwood 
my brother is an avid dvd collector he took one look at the cover two models on toilets and had to add it to his collection i stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie i use that term loosely i ve felt obligated to sit through i dared not make eye contact with my brother quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist the biggest name in the whole movie is michael clark duncan who appears in one scene which the filmmaker decided to show every take of about four total throughout the movie in fact the whole movie pretty much follows this suit the fact that the dvd contained deleted footage was a shock i went to bed without viewing it however to no surprise at all i found this disc without its case behind the tv about a week later 
imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something times worse got that ok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever ucm is the single worst movie i ve ever seen there were a few cheap laughs very few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funny the only reason i m not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasn t written or directed anything else and it s not surprise why 
i think i will make a movie next weekend oh wait i m working oh i m sure i can fit it in it looks like whoever made this film fit it in i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked it looks like someones home movie and i don t think more than was spent making it total crap who let s this stuff be released 
words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is it is a series of random unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady really disturbing the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco the best actor in this movie also it is rated nc shunning away the only people that might tolerate it 
hawked as the most offensive movie ever guaranteed to offend everyone guess what it worked i m offended that we shelled out money to rent this two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us it was by far the worst movie i ve seen since hollow man i generally avoid the crappy ones but got sucked into this one we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it and his movie picking privileges have been revoked there is nothing remotely funny about this movie even the adventures of dickman scene was sophomoric at best color me p ed thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason no it just sucked never watch this for any reason whatsoever not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny that s saying alot please for the love of all that is holy if you cherish your sanity never view this movie it s many things stupid pointless and worthless to name a few but the main thing it was aiming for offensively funny it failed miserably crash and burn 
how do i begin this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen it has no redeemable qualities i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle it failed to get even a single smile on my face i find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack i m pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap i will leave you with this warning do not watch this film it sucks 
it really impresses me that it got made the director writer actor must be really charismatic in reality i can think of no other way itd pass script stage what i want you to consider is this while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there not enjoying it just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying id really like to know what the budget is guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor i want to write the jokes didn t appeal to me but the reality is for them to appeal to you you d have to be the man who wrote them or a retard so imagine that in script form and this guy got that green lit thats impressive isn t it 
this movie shows a row of sketches which partly pass over into one another i realized the passing over late in the movie at first it only irritated me many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact using absurdity and obscenity the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails my personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie my god it hurts in my head every time i call it movie a bold attempt to turn nothing into something great but it failed at least the director made something out of nothing but it isn t something good many movies didn t turn out as funny as they were planned but this one tops them all it s the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making no to correct myself it s even worse than that a movie with gags so bad that they aren t funny at all it s not even fun to watch the lead actor writer and director all three the same guy by the way perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies the movie is too bad for that 
a series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day not as mind numbingly awful as say freddy got fingered or lost reality but that in no way is an endorsement in any way sense or form features the worst rhyming clown ever any most if it isn t offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct it also has the worst song parody ever put on film the worst arnold impersonation ever not just the worst put on film literally the worst ever i have no clue why karen black micheal clarke duncan or slash would star in this the reasons i watched this in the first place the only thing mildly amusing was dickman in conclusion i would t recommend this film to anyone but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the bottom on this site are pathetic do something notable with you lives people plus if it s true the church of scientalogy hates him he can t be all bad my grade d
i m into bad movies but this has nothing going for it despite what the morons above have said it is not funny i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director writer should be prohibited from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again to love movies and comedy is to despise this film i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was if you like this movie you are a pothead as sober there is nothing here zero if you need to compare underground movies see kentucky fried movie or early john waters the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire the rule for comedy is this if it s funny you can say or do anything but if it s not funny you are not satirical you are not edgy you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny zero 
this is the worst movie i ve ever seen in my life this is saying quite a bit considering some of the choices i ve made in film rentals i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it the topless scene lasted all of about seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spender the skits are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker room gags and it s such a blatant and poor rip off of the kentucky fried movie that you ll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of vince offer whoever that is unless you are a masochist avoid this pile of rubbish 
this bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie this installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny there s almost a half hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert and lots of people watching on free tv since when does that happen surely the script writer could have done something more creative look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation not in this film which pretty much ended the bill ted franchise the joke was over the grim reaper is tossed into the mix for whatever reason this infusion like the whole plot is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement there s a zz top impression hammered in for no reason there s lights smoke mirrors noise but nothing really creative or funny skip this bogus thing 
hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward it is something like minutes long but would be better in ten there s like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops and habits in a church tower like quasimodo only he is much less sympathetic there s a strange love story involved which doesn t have anything to do with anything she happens to look like his mother yes so what we know he misses his mother that s what the first ten minutes were about they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o k short film now it s a portrait of a character who doesn t change he is a guy that stuff happens to the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job there s this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character he paints his face dresses in women s clothing and wears a dead badger on his head a badger you ve got to see the ending he returns to his home with the badger on his head and it is shot like a tacky horror film to kill his dad s new wife which he had sex with in the beginning and somehow they thought this wouldn t be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background i ve got to admit though i m kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose it feels like this mackenzie director guy whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school you are so smart thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories you really dug what a wallraff okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book but anyway photowise it is boring a lot of talking heads plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene you know cold and warm etc why maybe hallam foe is both a feature and a test film for color blind people or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn t be enough to tell us that he feels lonely so they increased blue so that we really get it i m not even gonna comment on the clich indie oh how how how cute drawings they have made in the presentation and all the cute sex stuff going on this whole film is an independent clich but i do recommend it i laughed more than a few times though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine 
in its way mister foe originally and more appropriately titled hallam foe i can t see addressing its title character as mister is a tribute to good acting both jamie bell as hallam a physically attractive voyeur creep and sophia myles as kate his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance are convincing the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life a young man who spies on the intimate details of people s lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp and a woman in kate s situation would be repulsed and frightened she would probably call the police these things are not however what happens in the movie poor hallam s mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he s been having an affair hallam of course hates his stepmother and lets he know it she has sex with him kate s some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games she looks like his birth mother it all ends happily with hallam resolving his issues forty some years ago the play and brilliantly acted movie who s afraid of virginia woolf had a similarly optimistic ending with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart the trouble is it doesn t always work that way especially when nobody really cares in virginia woolf the ending s plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation in mister foe the emotional revelation never really happens 
proof why hollywood conventions are in place stale dialogue underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn s bonnie and clyde and george roy hill s butch cassidy and the sundance kid truly innovative filmmakers and films but falling well below the bar problems with storylines being self explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor stills black white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can t transition well or to replace scenes that just didn t work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid overly dramatic pauses between sentences random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn t needed for storytelling plus over the top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late s i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post production the playing of music in most two shots and close ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots doors footsteps and dialogue a style used in the late s through the mid s by new directors but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no likeable characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the hero a necessity for any story to work for me we know from penn s and hill s movies who the heroes are even though they are criminals we like them and want to see them get away i could care less who was on the screen in this film i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger s life from june to july his death to be fair there are some moments of good solid storytelling which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn t seem to try to copy other filmmakers dillinger isn t a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial big budget debut but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy 
anyone who visited drive ins in the s s and s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled s giant cannon films wherever movie goers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the s came horror movies like voodoo woman and the undead in the s were frankie avalon annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like the glory stompers and into the s aip churned out grindhouse level trash like cannibal girls and sugar hill dillinger released in is one of the more highbrow aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriter director john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career the minute dillinger epic for aip s scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in dillinger is basically a chase film with purvis s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover dillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillinger s strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn t there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including s bonnie and clyde but we simply don t get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shoot em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail aside from this the picture s main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger is just a film it s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as milius s screenplay and the film s documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldn t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them warren oates s performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it s really too bad that milius s screenplay didn t flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a briefly appearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talent as a piece of s exploitation dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgm s dvd release for the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts the film doesn t really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre it s certainly worth checking out out of roving reviewer www geocities com paul_johnr
i recently watched this film at the th gothenburg film festival and to be honest it was on of the worst films i ve ever had the misfortune to watch don t get me wrong there are the funny and entertaining bad films e g manos hands of fate and then there are the awful bad films this one falls into the latter category the cinematography was unbelievable and not in a good way it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot the lighting was something between one guy running around with a light bulb and non existing the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer a classic look a la jason vorhees from friday the th the plot was extremely poor and the ending even worse i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like or maybe an insomniac needing sleep 
the latest rumor going around is that vh is starting casting calls for i love new york mid so does this mean budah or tailor made dumped new york or does this mean new york dumped the winner i know flavor of love is coming up to it s rd season so now with a flavor of love and a i love new york will there ever be a true winner i ve also heard a few rumors that chance will be brought back for the rd season of i love new york i have also heard rumors that new york will be specially featured on flavor of love hopefully this was not too much of a spoiler for the ending of i love new york i m just stating the latest rumor 
the show is average it doesn t make me laugh particularly however i think courtney really brings it down she doesn t look natural she has these three ways to talk all robotic she talks quietly with no intonation she talks normally with no intonation or she does that thing where she starts talking normally and starts yelling gradually however her yelling is like let s pretend i m yelling because i shouldn t be too loud on the set she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing it s annoying you can t really get her personality because she doesn t really produce emotion and doesn t get upset she has this husband who s doing all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her very dry and plain acting 
shown in australia as hydrosphere this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get any worse and it does the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures and the acting is wooden the infant muppet seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of total recall there didn t seem to be a single original idea in the whole movie i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame he obviously needed the money 
there are two reasons why i did not give a to this movie one reason are some of the actors like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh work who tried to play at their usually good level of acting however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg which is quite different to most other such roles i ve seen so far everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be boring scenes useless and boring dialogs bad script work and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors it could have been an interesting story though but they failed completely 
this is one of the worst written movies i ve ever had to sit through the story s nothing new but it s a cartoon so who cares as long as it s pretty and fun i m not going to go as deep as the characterisations or i ll be here all day except to say that there aren t any the characters change personality whenever it s convenient to the plot but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper thumbs down i d vote to cut their thumbs off narrow in on an object prop cut back to character close up character gives a knowing look which the audience will not even remotely understand repeat that several times with different objects props make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around crashing into each other generally raining destruction all over and which could kill them all at any moment but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless looking almost pastoral green rock in the distance the whole thing is a long succession of events actions and behaviour that are only there for the convenience of the writer to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the story properly this is the plan of cg cartoons except that it doesn t have ed wood groan factor to make it fun to watch do yourselves a favour spend your cartoon budget on pixar movies 
terrible use of scene cuts all continuity is lost either by awful scripting or lethargic direction that villainous robot musta been a jazz dancer also one of the worst sound tracks i ve ever heard monologues usually drowned out by music and where d they get their props that ship looks like a milk carton i did better special effects on mm at the age of i d recommend any film student should watch this flick minutes at a time so as to learn how not to produce a film or was it the editors fault it s really too bad because the scenario was actually a good concept just poorly executed all the way around sorry malcom you should have sent a stunt double you re too good an actor for such a stink bomb 
this is one of those so bad it is good films that you always hear about but never see unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy and i am not amused this one is pure serious however with features such as a supposedly super lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining watcheable enough because of that 
disappointing and undeniably dull true crime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer who was easily one of the last century s most recognizable degenerates serial killers released straight to video back in early dahmer is an overtly talky boring badly acted and virtually bloodless snore fest of a true crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do what it does however attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was overall s dahmer is one that true crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because i m not kidding when i say that it s one of the worst serial killer biopics ever done it s even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight to video trash like gacy bundy ed gein and the night stalker turkey zero stars 
oh my how can they make movies of such beauty but that are so terribly bad i mean even uwe boll doesn t make crap like this there is not even a hint of a decent story multi layered characters or attraction it s just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a movie i suppose only children up to years of age could enjoy it given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent that anyone older would be annoyed by it but then again it s far too scary for anyone under years of age that there s probably no one that should watch this movie at all take my advice and stay far far away from this movie your little daughter can make a better storyline and though she probably isn t able to draw pictures this pretty her tales are much more worth listening to and please in the name of whoever you believe in do not expose your children to this piece of i ll give it out of and that s exclusively for the graphics because the story and character development are so awful they d deserve a negative rating and if you decide to watch it anyways remember that i warned you 
way to go ace you just made a chilling grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft mellow drama obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds horror or documentary right this was neither it wasn t close to any detailed facts in fact it barely had any substance at all it wasn t really morbid or scary or didn t even try to be very disturbing as if you would ve had to try what the hell was this writer director thinking here s one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent s house i think jacobson was actually trying to present or invent the soft side of j dahmer 
well it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but i feel i must say something i wasn t exactly looking for a splatterfest as someone puts it or even blood and guts gore i have some respect for the victims relatives although i really felt the filmaker didn t they were nameless faceless and meaningless just a vessel for dahmers sexual antics i watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think what makes a guy be a serial killer as well as wondering the specifics about the dahmer story of which i know very little people here seem to think that the movie didn t have to cover the events of the dahmer story i e his history what happened when he got caught the aftermath etc but it is important you see i assume if you are american you will know all of this we do not all live in america to tell this story about such a man as he obviously was requires that at least some of the history and actual events are told shown this doesn t mean blood and guts there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to gore without even touching upon some of what he did i found out more about him reading the user comments on this site the movie felt like a void a moment in time with very little substance i would like to know if there is a film about the real dahmer because with its lack of direction very slow pace that never changes strange portrayal of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of any attempt at an ending this movie is poor i would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it a definite out of for the acting 
i m a big fan of the true crime genre but i couldn t sit through this putrid piece it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica down to the porn flic soundtrack there was no look at what made dahmer tick no exploration of who his victims were nothing but look at how creepy this guy is and i have to give the filmmakers this much their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen 
the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to de commercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing 
taped this late night movie when i was in grade watched it on fast forward i sugest you do the same i though it would be and action film but went to a cort tv type movie in the end it fits in with the early s social activest type films glad i missed that era 
skullduggery is a strange strange film based on the novel ye shall know them by vercors to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well meaning tone skullduggery simply isn t a very good film for me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can t make its mind up how best to convey its message the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk later it teeters into sci fi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you re watching a muddled disorganised movie an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple burt reynolds one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame susan clark after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape like creatures these primitive long lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics the archaeologists call the tribe the tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen paul hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers he questions whether the tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued this was a very early film in reynolds career and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he s in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously not that reynolds can be blamed he has an impossible role asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick his character and the film are not relevant to each other clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox alexander knox and wilfrid hyde white a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids the stuck on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical and that s just not the right idea we re meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures but that s awfully hard when they look so unconvincing skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant philosophical and stimulating the honourable intentions are there for all to see but the end result doesn t do them justice a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless 
over several years of looking for half decent films to rent for my kids i ve developed a sixth sense for spotting the really cheesy direct to video efforts that are really painful to sit through for anyone over the age of eight i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me what did she say that for and why did he do that and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply bringing realism to a film please run them through with a dull butter knife prehysteria was head and shoulders above this arrgh 
i read the back of the box and it talked about mary shelley and percy shelley and lord byron i thought wonderful this will be great i was so wrong the story was all screwed up in fact i still don t get it it just seems to me that all the characters did was drink smoke opium and have sex not that those aren t good movie qualities but please where was the story i made myself finish the movie and yes it did pick up towards the end but by then the movie was almost over rent it if you really want to just don t trust the back of the box 
i know it s a power rangers gimmick and catered to year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie if they are going to write a plot with crayons at least have the decency to make it silly it s kind of hilarious if you watch this we have a typical family filled with cliched characters father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself lolol air head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space funny stuff however the real great moment comes near the end when war dad and bad acting villain try to work a sword fight but then they realize none of them know how to probably because no room in budget for choreographers so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in lol rating because they try to treat this seriously 
this film was on late at night when i saw it it was interesting at start but it didn t convince me as a whole i am no tyson fan in fact i don t like boxing at all it s barbaric obscene and double faced by society that some get money for beating each other up nevertheless i felt the start of the film was ok actors alright especially george c scott as cus d amato i don t know how reliable the flick is i haven t read books and books about boxing or tyson i don t know anything about the man but it was quite entertaining as the movie went on i felt it lost a little of it s charm and i also lost interest i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough 
as far as spaghetti westerns go i d put this man can t die on the dull side of the genre it s not that the movie is particularly bad but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i ve seen guy madison does his best in the lead role but lacks the on screen charisma necessary to pull it off with one notable exception the rest of the cast isn t particularly good the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven t seen before there s just not much to get very excited about the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri she s the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film unfortunately her screen time is limited to less than minutes note the imdb page for this man can t die is wrong rosalba neri does not play jenny benson instead she is the character melin i m not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb s credits for the movie 
second tier american leading man guy madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this spaghetti western which having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine though featuring a nice enough score the plot offers some mild interest the title incidentally refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun runners on a ranch the property of the family of their pursuer cavalry agent madison the latter s younger siblings are determined that the injured party now in their charge lead them to the gang boss responsible ultimately the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise and both ironically become involved with one of madison s sisters another is raped during the raid euro cult starlet rosalba neri appears unremarkably as a saloon hostess and madison s ex flame 
when i saw this movie i heard all the hype and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent i was wrong i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community if they are not african americans themselves i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won sometimes this is true not as much nowadays because whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was is because people see a movie about the semi spoiler hardships of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece denzel washington is an outstanding actor but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever i was bored with him in the movie and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good the audience is supposed to leave believing this man rubin carter is a saint people left the movies worshipping this man this hero and they went out and bought his book making this hero of a man rich spoilers this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit of course the crimes he did commit stealing mostly was only to survive nothing more people felt sorry for him even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife but why wouldn t it after all it is his point of view i do not like movies especially hollywood interpretations that are based on true stories because they usually distort the true parts into something else something not so true this was his point of view and a hollywood construction yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably well i researched his past a bit before making any assumptions and he was a very violent man not only that there is still a possibility that he did murder those people if you do not believe me search for him on the internet and read the articles some people have of him the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily was actually won by his opponent joey giardello and there are tapes to prove it besides that there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully denzel s acting is stale and the supporting cast s mickey mouse attitudes are annoying the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring 
this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with saw it years ago as an adolescent stayed up late to do so was very annoyed to find that it was about romance everything else history if that it s what i call a bait and switch movie one with an interesting title the actual movie is a scam this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment this movie is almost an insult to those who served the actual members of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help france and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunter s character flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn t have lasted two days it would have either been the stockade or the infantry discipline in the french army was often rather fierce in short another hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment 
probably the worst film i ve ever seen the acting and story were terrible and i almost fell asleep the only good actor was colm meaney i had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end no emotion no charisma nothing 
i had high hopes for this film because i thought clean shaven kerrigan s first feature was absolutely terrific the most assuredly cinematic low budget film i d ever seen but much of claire dolan is utterly pointless and flat scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix without much thought for narrative or character is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not hard to tell why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color why does claire accept some johns and not others the filmmaker doesn t seem to know it feels as if everything is improvised though i understand this wasn t the case and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary after the screening i saw kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative it sounded like learned rhetoric i think it was a cop out i am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as clean shaven would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old political cliches 
this is exactly the sort of saturday matinee serial i loved during world war ii i was under ten years of age and that s the audience this serial is designed for looking at it now one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity the budget must have been next to nothing given the shortcuts and repeats the acting well this is republic pictures they read the lines and no doubt had one take to make them convincing one and half stars 
i heard and read many praising things about midnight meat train which is based on a short story written by no less than clive barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original hellraiser that he directed himself but so far i can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience the most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is nauseating the violence is sadistic and extreme which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts but it s also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative normally speaking i m very pro violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose the butchering literally depicted in midnight meat train is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs and even that isn t fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects there are more shortcomings some even bigger than the pointless gore but perhaps i should focus on the good elements first the basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences like the chase in the freezer room for example are literally oozing with nail biting suspense and macabre atmosphere unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities but i honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by vinnie jones the plot introduces leon an aspiring photographer in new york whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train leon s right as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer but the killer s motivations and behavior suggest there s something far more substantial going on the rails at night midnight meat train takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood but director ry hei kitamura versus godzilla final wars doesn t take full advantage of it all the ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and even if clive barker meant to have like this i still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale midnight meat train is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film but not without defaults it s not intended for easily offended viewers but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well 
i don t know why but i thought i ve seen this movie before maybe it was the name maybe it was the way poster looked i don t know anyway it was quite promising in the beginning and even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments maybe its because i m not a huge fan of the horrors and i don t watch them a lot but this one actually looked fresh sometimes but the rest of it is not so good laughable at times the movie is slow paced sometimes you will get so bored you d forget what was the story about characters are not great either all of them the butcher is ok seems creepy and crazy enough although i didn t get what were those weird looking things on his chest that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out of the blue and why he was collecting those in jars at home the main lead is plain his character is really hard to believe in and very undeveloped but i guess thats scenarists fault like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend side cast is bad too but the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl my god when will women in horror movies have any brains its ridiculous the girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera tries going to police that fails and then she thinks of the best idea ever why don t we just go and take it i know where the maniac lives yup thats swell and then look for the camera in the bathroom why not and then walk in the room see a bag that was not there before and just have a look inside maybe camera is there not there but loads of interesting stuff shiny mmmm to realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain then of course the never ending falling while running away trick that really made it look bad then to put the final nail into the character in the end of the movie she walks into the wagon full with dead bodies hanging feet up screams noooo like she just ripped her gucci bag and walks further into the wagon jeez come on no one else thinks its just well stupid just awful if her character wasn t so bad maybe the movie would get another star or two from me and i would even forgive mmt characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer that dude in the train who the conductor killed butcher vests that can protect from bullets weird and cheap looking monsters in the end i didn t read clive barkers novel so i have no idea where those monsters came from the fact that no one cared that hundreds judging on the skeletons in the dungeon disappeared in the city and main character that didn t bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out he barely noticed it i guess oh and the predictable ending damn i knew the ending half way in its just disappointing the only reason i m still giving some credit to the makers is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i ve watched past few months visual style is nice some shots were really nice and good cgi that made the killings look really brutal although blood didn t look real at all i guess some people will enjoy it some like me will watch it if there is nothing else to watch some will absolutely hate it 
i have heard a lot about this film with people writing me telling me i should see it as i am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies i got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now i would have been better off not remembering i even had it this movie was atrocious the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was i know it was a story by clive barker and all and no i have not read that story but it appears to me that if you haven t then you will be as i was completely clueless and utterly disappointed the film begins good enough the actors are convincing the story interesting the first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention i thought the blood looked a bit bad but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on i was wrong the blood and effects are so horrible it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a person s head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use any real blood at all my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film unbelievable acts of dismemberment eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies too dark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadows it just gets worse and worse i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake there s just too much add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial killer movie turns into some demonic supernatural monster movie at the end no thank you it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway ok with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant plausible doable and a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you and unless you read the book well you just won t ever understand it fiasco tragic what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential if you like mindless fake blood and gore you ll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it stay away far far away 
one hour eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame that was right after hopalong chris lybbert drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy great bar gimmick which didn t translate into anything at all obviously the name coppola in the credits couldn t do anything to guarantee success here even with more than one listed if you make it to the end of the film you ll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did what exactly was the hook with the gloves what s up with the rodeo scenario who was the stranger supposed to represent why did they make this film i could probably go on but my energy s been drained look there s already a western called the gunfighter from with a guy named gregory peck as the title character watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad that one i can recommend 
i would just like it to be known that i do not often rate movies below a i was originally very excited to see this movie its numerous trailer bumps on tv for several months made me reaally want to see this movie so the other night when i saw that it was available on fearnet on demand i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film the storyline seemed intriguing enough some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway there s a photographer obsessed with the missing people where are they going what s happening to them one day the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher following him around yada yada the film had a way of sucking you in even though the plot was highly predictable oh no it s dark look out behind you i say quite bored with the cheap thrills the plot even though predictable was intriguing that is until the end this was good until the end then it just got silly says jack_skellington_freke on the message boards and i fully agree and here come the spoilers see i was hoping it was some mad killer some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism no it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries woo how original how unrealistic how dull come on lionsgate you ve had amazing films but this one sunk 
do not bother to waste your money on this movie do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you if you must see a movie this weekend go see batman again the script was horrible perfectly written from the random horror movie format given a place in confined spaces a madman with various weapons a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together and an innocent and overly curious yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend mix together add much poorly executed gore and what the hell let s put some freaks in there for a little spin to the plot the acting was horrible and the characters unbelievable borat was more believable than this spoiler and can someone please tell me how a butcher s vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch i m in the army we need that kind of stuff for ourselves out of and i would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score i can 
i often feel like scrooge slamming movies that others are raving about or i write the review to balance unwarranted raves i found this movie almost unwatchable and unusual for me was fast forwarding not only through dull clich d dialog but even dull clich d musical numbers whatever originality exists in this film unusual domestic setting for a musical lots of fantasy some animation is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought provoking plot development individually june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people but can t carry a movie as a team neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal they re both bland i like billy gray but his character is pretty one note the best part of the film to me are june haver s beautiful costumes and great body 
i was never so bored in my life hours of pretentious self obsessed heroin addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems it s like watching lizards molt even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy if you have insomnia rent this 
one previous reviewer called this film pure visual joy i am wondering if s he saw the same film that i did high art had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since seven one can almost forgive sheedy and mitchell for the clich of going to a b b for their first time of course before they do that one has to watch opium den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types the girlfriend boyfriend at start who are well aware they re going to be thrown over sometime in the next minutes or so the movie also states that the sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now what did she do retire at age twenty 
this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fast moving story an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths etc funny thing is you probably couldn t make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police nonetheless woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes snipes had a lot of funny put down lines providing much of the humor the bad part of the film which doesn t bother a lot of people is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters that includes woody s girlfriend played by rosie perez there are no really clean nice people in this movie for that reason i can t honestly recommend the film at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity
you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of jeopardy the saddest thing about white men can t jump is that it had tremendous potential for several years i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film racial tensions were high and basketball meant everything to everyone a film about the members of this basketball culture could have been very interesting but the mediocre acting and poor script in white men can t job left something to be desired the movie s sequence of events is cyclical first billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball he then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend and the process is repeated most stories build up to a climax of some kind but the climax i saw was just another sequence in this repetition this case being billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball in order for a plot to develop some dilemma must be resolved and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well apparently the writers of white men can t jump forgot this rule as the plot can be summarized as billy needs to pay the bills i appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies but i m sorry this was just plain awful i could have cared less if billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment despite all this white men can t jump is a successful film apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them others i m sure were lured by the big names playing the leading roles this leaves me to wonder if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse would anyone have bothered watching this movie i really don t think so i ll give this movie two stars out of ten the extra star is for the jeopardy scene which kept me awake for a few minutes thanks trebek 
is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant life spanning testimonial of spring summer fall winter and spring the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite nearly silent heartbreaking longing of iron the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of the coast guard and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all characters and viewers alike to experience redemption in samaritan girl i just cannot seem to find him in this film oh sure kim s nature motif is still present the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters yes it s kim ki duk all right kim even describes the film as beautiful in an interview included in the dvd s special features but i m not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation what is beautiful about angry potty mouthed prostitutes lustful violent and potty mouthed fishermen a covetous mute merchant explicit animal torture sequences of self mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material it has been favorably compared to audition by japanese director takashi miike much to kim s satisfaction but aside from some astonishingly good performances especially given what they had to work with by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk i find little reason to recommend this film i have not seen audition but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of the isle its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic its sex is not pornographic but passionless and masochistic characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot its point is either non existent or i will admit lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand the only beauty is in the cinematography which is classic kim fog shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake mountainous terrain dominating the background and an imaginative and playful use of color at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room some touches like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes are intriguing but as a film this effort is downright confusing and in the end offensive to the senses not necessarily to sensibilities one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film making in the trash heap of his past for we know he is capable of so much more 
i generally don t give worry much about violence in films or a vast amount of philosophy symbolism or psychology all this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us there is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature a good setting of characters a good direction this film could be voted for as a good film however it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting first of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film not movie violence i am talking about real violence this violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women not that we all don t have some real twists with women respectively men but the conclusion of the film ruins it all spoiler our heroine finally dies by here own hand if i remember correctly i saw this film years ago and it enraged me now the guy is out with a new film witch i am certainly not going to watch and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon nature growing over her in particular her sex of course it is the director who kills the women heroine women have to die especially if men are attracted by their sexuality that seems to be the final conclusion end spoiler well well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself but to use big pictures artsy directions cruelty to living creatures just to say men can be frightened of women and men are cruel to women thats just not enough i knew when i saw this film it would achieve good critics for the philosophical eastern and artistic and whatever approach but to me this film is just totally marred 
i m not sure what diane silver was thinking when she was making this movie but it obviously had nothing to do with richard wright s novel which the movie is based on we read the novel this past summer for ap english and just watched the film during periodic note taking and checking of the clock i contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning of course the sky was completely clear and i was forced to watch the rest of the movie and then write a paragraph essay on it wright s novel discussed very real themes of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it silver s movie turned a murderer into a victim which is not what wright wanted see how bigger was born i m going to make this short and sweet if you want to leave your consciousness in raphael lambert s words unsullied skip the movie and read the book the adaptation is not thought provoking material sigh now i have to write the essay 
watch the version as personally annoying i find charles boyer s voice he s more of a match to pay cosmopolitan depressed rudolf i mean omar sharif tries but no too cute and vibrant catherine denueve sp besides being too old looks nothing like marie nothing she looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion the only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they re playing is ava gardner whose appearance as empress elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief and look up pictures of the empress there s more than a passing resemblance as historically empress elisabeth wasn t involved that much in rudolf s life 
i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit the script and dialogue is laughable the acting was awful where did they get them from music was ok i have to say luckily i didn t buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of i was geared up at the beginning when the stranger martin sheen started to tell his story i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot tex s finger off and told him to practise for years to reach his league but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better never did 
despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky or think he s a tired relic from the s i really had no opinion of the man save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist although i could not elucidate any of his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings so stumbling across the dvd of the documentary noam chomsky rebel without a pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a book tour for his book i decided to get it just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him while glad i got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was so what s all the fuss about for a man with so many degrees lauded as the most important intellectual alive by the new york times according to the dvd s case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and i wouldn t even want to watch what a william f buckley could do to him granted the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he d say rather than being on linguistics so maybe that s the reason he came off so badly but again if he is a linguist and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise even worse are his acolytes who seem to further insulate the man from reality by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film this much i knew he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the soviet empire the film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that it s difficult to separate all of the jumble his wife carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film she seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life the lone interesting thing she says is that was a great thing for the chomskys for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then not surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no biographical background it s assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this great man bears chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one stylistically there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that and slack jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him this is really poor film making by director and editor will pascoe who in the dvd s filmmaker statement shows he s yet another uncritical acolyte of chomsky s other than that one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere agitprop and a vanity piece of agitprop at that is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomsky s lectures at mcmaster university in ontario canada prior to the american invasion of iraq in much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era yes he makes some good points here and there on american media complicity before the war but he follows them up with sheer lunacy for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not fully plotted out cabals as example he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled similarly he claims trilateralists run the world and that people s fear of crime is yet another cabal s result of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district attorneys offices consume he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when castro and company were great sponsors of it in latin america asia and africa until the soviet union fell i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species mixing impregnation centers up in idaho in his simpleminded world without grays chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco whom he reviles are even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals in short chomsky is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually near this film s end he warns be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn t like no matter how barbarous their crimes and anti intellectual their posit please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant dvd 
first off i agree with quite a bit that escapes mr chomsky s mouth his matter of fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus he comes across likable unassuming pragmatic he doesn t cater to the current political style obnoxious bi partisanship and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right chastising both and for good reason unfortunately the film itself is a dud in fact i would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches watching rebel without a pause is no different from watching a speaker on a am taped segment on cspan there are no camera movements no edits no stylistic touches there is no story no narrative technically speaking the production is strictly amateurish audio is terrible and inconsistent sometimes we cannot hear noam speak other times we cannot hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance when noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her i cannot recommend this film and would say that you re probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or cd to listen to in the car out of stars and i m in a generous mood today 
a documentarist like any filmmaker must convey a compelling story will pascoe fails utterly in this effort cobbling together uninspired snippets of chomsky s wisdom from a visit to mcmaster university in hamilton the footage is shot amateurishly and in video pascoe s only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen activism truth lame compare this with documentaries like the corporation or the fog of war which create a narrative drawing material from interviews stock footage and filmed footage in the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently the only saving graces of the film are chomsky s nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma and the fact that the running time is only minutes one of the more interesting passages was chomsky s recounting of his experience with national public radio he describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views while npr s liberal dogma strait jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages yet another media outlet to be skeptical of this documentary is for noam chomsky completists only 
what more can i say the acting was almost without exception amateurish the directing and continuity were pitiful the sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious one of the features on the dvd was labeled gag reel but that could have been a description of a viewer s reaction to most of the movie one of the most amusing things was in the director s comments on the dvd he said with a straight face that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast and that he had succeeded with delusions like that it s easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster the darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit per the making of feature on the dvd and rather looked it the mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store the cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game 
let me start by saying that i d read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect still i was surprised by just how bad it was i am a big werewolf fan and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one most of them have sub par effects poor acting and weak storylines at best rehashed from earlier films so far with the possible exception of some of the later howling series films this is the worst of the lot first the story it s been quoted several times in reviews on this site so i won t go into specifics however it is very obvious that the writer s had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters as so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves above such fare they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos that s fine but a non horror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them the plot feels like a parody of werewolf films and the events depicted just ring so false that i felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted tv news footage for example never pans away from the reporter to close up on someone in the crowd behind them give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign and that s just the tip of the iceberg as for effects i have never seen a less believable werewolf i d have been happier with lon chaney jr in crepe hair the beast they used look a great deal like well like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics and i know that many people have already criticized the cg but my god it was awful one scene features a woman changing and starts with a completely cg version of the actress nude but for some reason without nipples my first thought was hey why is one of the characters from reboot turning into a silly looking werewolf anyway i like to look for positives in any film and there were a few the cinematography was passable the film was shot all digital which is interesting and some of the performances were not terrible it was also interesting seeing tippi hedron as the world s most well made up homeless woman and kane hodder as the title bad guy also the yellow power ranger got all growed up and well damn and if you re looking for skin there s some pretty tasty examples this ends the male pig segment of the review overall if you want a good werewolf film try an american werewolf in london the original the howling dog soldiers or even the wolfen though that one s got more wolf than were if you re a lycanthrope completest then take a gander otherwise give this one a miss 
there isn t much to say about this film it is horrible the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid werewolf s is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there cgi is something you wouldn t like to see it so amateurish that it makes me vomit the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras the gag reel everything else just waste of time and money i hope noone will buy this this is not even worth renting just stay away of this 
hopalong cassidy with a horse who is not white not named topper go figure this travesty does a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes hopalong cassidy the actor who plays him is young versus old blond haired versus white haired and kills people versus shooting the gun out of their hands will the real hopalong please stand up one of the worst movies ever made believe it or not by the person who brought us the grandfather saga 
i thought i was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have ten times better animations low budget is a fitting comment i would recommend wolf with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie it has good special effects as they should be human transforming to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie this movie is a joke 
man this movie sucked big time i didn t even manage to see the hole thing my girlfriend did though really bad acting computer animations so bad you just laugh woman to werewolf strange clips the list goes on and on don t know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie and i don t mean all the naked ladys it s something about the light or something this could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women but not because it s an original movie white a nice plot twist my final words are don t see it it s not worth the time if you wanna see it because the nakedness there s lots of better ones to see 
this is the absolutely worst piece of crap i ve ever had to watch actually it was so bad that i just had to watch it the cgi is sooo bad it s fun it s not even close to the shitty cgi animations in spawn that s how bad it is har har har i m amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on dvd but i guess they ll get more money out of it that way cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars it s so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it see it and laugh 
where to start i feel violated thats right violated i just spent hrs of my life hrs that i could have spent doing something more useful like watching paint dry on this so called horror flick its not scary its not funny its not dramatic its no action its nothing its predictable its boring its tragic i might come of a bit harsh here but watch this movie and you will feel the same way or no don t watch it unless you want to feel violated also 
this is the prime example of low budget winning over what would be a good story line let s bring back samaire armstrong having seen her work on the o c i know she can do better then find a better script and budget the special effects were so bad and mostly badly computer generated that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on screen and samaire armstrong s alert changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad gcif figure before she even begins to change final fantasy s humans as well as pixar s made these laughable think of the figure as a nude barbie doll the story of was interesting though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new as it also got into the balance between evil maybe not so evil and the possible end of human kind should the two lines mate the subplot of a book of werewolf linage which effected some of the other characters in a spell like manner for a while was effective but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past bring in a better script and direction and i d come back again 
in this day and age of incredible special movie effects this one was a sore disappointment the actors seemed stiff and uninspired as was the dialogue westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days but movies like silverado prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one considering that it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing much less creating such a weak film as this one if you love and are looking for a good western keep looking 
i watched this film alone in the dark and it was full moon outside i didn t do it in purpose it just happened in this way so all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me well it didn t in fact i wanted to shut off the dvd player after only minutes but i thought come on give it a chance unfortunately i did the acting was awful the only one with some decent acting was samaire armstrong the plot is not original if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before some scenes didn t make sense at all and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer the monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie the scary scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the s when there was not enough technology yet some good movies were made back then i was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie i thought couldn t they put some money in this and make it decent i couldn t agree more with the ratings that the movie got it is also my rating for it out of 
another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story within minutes the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines so there is absolutely no mystery which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense the only half way competent actor is killed minutes into the film so we re left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things low budget films can t afford expensive special effects so the cgi portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive but were at least a valid attempt the creature suit is terrible as seen when it falls to the sidewalk and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes which aren t even the red color shown in mirror shots the dialogue is clumsy and uninspired with some lines reminiscent of aliens or terminator the last action sequence takes place in a police station also a rip off from terminator with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the darkwolf doesn t smash into in the end the girl calls the hero a good protector but he gets both his partners the original protector and at least three other civilians not to mention a dozen cops all killed without getting a decent shot off in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun but here s the real clincher for bad writing they could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes instead they took it into custody 
dark wolf quick review let s get right to it this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh t on it it s just an awful movie it s an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an s high school drama film what s worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf kane f cking hodder someone s trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film career anyway former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf too it s kind of a crappy cop drama with the world s worst looking werewolf in it but it does have moments of near rampant nudity but that s about all want to know more okay the werewolf is generally an ugly looking black blur zipping around the screen and when we re privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence we re presented with something that resembles a full motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation the first playstation the cg animation is really that primitive only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit www residenthazard com
i saw this movie at a sneak preview and i must honestly confess that i do not like films with meryl streep that much this picture was the worst half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film i couldnt blame them if this wasn t a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear 
we saw this on the shelf at the local video store saw coppola in the credits and got excited that was the one and only time this movie raised any interest i could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humourous film that failed miserably or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably in general the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish the sound in particular was absolutely dreadful especially in the scenes shot in the little bar the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable very disappointing 
jack black is an annoying character this is an annoying indie movie for year olds do i have to write eight more lines ana de la reguera is dang fine to look at as a mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of jack black this movie is a pg version of an indie film i really like a movie that has the courage to explore mexican culture this movie explores mexican culture deeply i just choke on its cultural rudeness jack black is just so rude a white person like jack black is not my most valuable emissary into mexican culture as it were mexican wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy such as myself could seek i suspect mexico is more culturally opaque than jack black has presented here i think imdb changed my review has anyone else had his review changed as well just a question 
i mean really either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie it s stupid ridiculous and just not funny at all since i saw the preview i knew it wasn t going to be a great movie i just didn t think it was gonna be that bad what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie when the actors didn t have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny now we find ourselves with movies like this one borat little men scary movie where i could not find the funny parts just skip this piece of garbage p s sorry for my english 
i m sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn t you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department i just sat there through most of the movie thinking is this supposed to be funny and this is the guy from tenacious d right the truth is this film has nothing to offer at all it s a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction you ll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn t i was bored stupid about minutes in but though it would surely pick up it didn t minutes later i d barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful it s like remember years ago when you d see anything with your fave actor in it even some of their really early pap from before they were famous and you d be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop yeah it s like that i ve enjoyed some of jack black s earlier movies like shallow hall and i m really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man if you do this to us again jack i m gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something at the least give you a serious talking to i know it s a clich but this is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen and for so many reasons 
jack black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing but in this movie besides the direction writing lack of plot constant mugging aided and abetted by constant straight on camera shots and a joke batting average it was still an utter waste of time the idea sounds promising but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction i ve seen this side of you tube i kept hearing that this film portrayed mexicans very negatively while that s no doubt true i really don t think this movie is meant to be racist i think that s it s more a result of a creative team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess you can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera hey look it s an ugly mexican laugh people please for the love of all things tenacious laugh but put the racism charges aside when you get down to it it s anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended imo 
if it wasn t for the bad dialogues and script i mean the direction was really in touch with it s subject the actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life but in the end the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together i would highly suggest not to watch this unless you re a al pacino enthusiast like i am and will watch everything he is playing in even if the result lately are rather poor this is after s m ne a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles 
saw this movie in an early preview and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was from the very beginning the audience was groaning over pacino s awful southern accent poor al looked really really haggard and i can t decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist or perhaps he just didn t get any sleep before coming to the set much worse than pacino s close ups however is the wretched excuse for a plot early in the film we are given indications that pacino s character is gay and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended later however we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles lust after this elderly half dead looking effeminate man with the ridiculous accent the worst part overall was the main plot thread which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ever care about in the slightest because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment because of the possibility of re shoots and editing but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters 
firstly i must admit that it isn t a good movie and i would never watch this movie if pacino wasn t in it the movie is about a publicist s strange hours and he is overworked dizzy sick and sometimes regretful i don t like the character at all it s really boring after minutes you may fall asleep and i don t understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie just because of money or what since i m an avid pacino fan i bought this movie people i know if you haven t bought it yet don t even think about it it s just a waste of time 
i don t know what this movie is about really it s like a student s art school project they never say why the world is dark but it is always darkness except for seconds a day there are long interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images a black woman enters the main character s apartment somehow she becomes pregnant overnight then gets shot in the head the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be honestly i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it s about but i wouldn t wish this level of hell on anybody else 
 people i know is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about despite the game efforts of a talented cast pacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli wurman a past his prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption but unlike michael corleone it s impossible to have an emotional investment in this character his dilemma or his fate the film traces eli s preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause while distracted by a client s ryan o neal good in an underwritten part latest dirty laundry in this case a tv actress companion who s gotten involved with the wrong people tea leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role although again the script doesn t give her much to work with as eli s sister in law kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics this movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino strut his stuff and enjoy the other principals unfortunately between the script and direction people i know is strictly amateurish hence its limited theatrical release and speedy journey to dvd consider yourself warned 
yes mtv there really is a way to market daria what started as a clever teenage angst comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life sitcom now mutated into a how you should deal with your problems charade i used to watch daria all the time and loved it now sitting here after watching the so called movie i can only wonder what the point of this all was daria tells us how to lead out life in college excuse me didn t the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it this entire thing reminded me of the scene in reality bites the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time 
i wanted to watch this movie but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off character s don t seem to react to anything consider this heath ledger is walking a night through a cemetery i believe when he is attacked by spirits which he drives away once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all when asked what happen he says blandly attacked by demons nothing serious as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire i shut it off when they go to ask something a demon or something i stopped caring a ques ion the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing dying body question out of stars 
the orders fatal flaw besides an asinine plot is that the character s simply don t resonate or even react two examples a priest walking through a graveyard late at night is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits after fighting them off he calmly resumes his walk when his buddy come up anything wrong his buddy asks having seen the attack just some demonic spirits nothing i couldn t handle no reaction no surprise just like he d changed a tire his buddy is equally unconcerned must be standard priest training [ and then you put the wafer into their mouths any questions ok moving on demon spirit attacks ] example two at one point the priests need an answer to a question and only a demon or something who cared by now could provide it how why you have to ask a dying man so the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing gasping man hey don t kill him or maybe that s not nice would have been more realistic then their response they never ask that they let the man go or stop in fact the closest to reacting they get is mild annoyance they ask their question and go i had to shut it off at that point my brain was starting to atrophy avoid one star out of four 
this really is the worst film i have ever seen ever period i actually paid to watch this steaming turd of a movie incredibly dull poorly acted dire script often incoherent and too many scenes that don t seem to have any relevance to the overall film like when heath ledger s priest partner get s nailed to a wall by a ghost what was the point in that scene answers on a postcard please i should have got a medal for sticking with this film for it s entire running time i would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again this should be cast into imdb s bottom hopefully my vote of will help it on it s way 
i was really horrified by this eerie movie what an unusual dark atmosphere and such a creepy musical score really promising indeed after ten minutes you really start sweating and feeling uncomfortable for you start fearing the worst this movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare and what s worse it all comes out for one hour and a half i have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake nuit noire is a truly horrifying picture for your eyes your ears your intelligence and most of all your wallet since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all 
first of all i have to say i have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something i haven t seen taking this into account i want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made it made me pine for gigli my boss s daughter and any other piece of junk you ve ever seen belyt must be out of his mind i ve only found one person who liked it and even they couldn t tell me what the movie was about if you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because there s any other way a person could figure this crap out for the love of g d stay away 
the coming attractions to the order make it seem like a decent horror mystery thriller but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage first off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects the acting was also nothing to be proud of but keath ledger i think i spelled that right saved the movie in this category for heaven s sake don t see this movie 
this sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what i heard about gigli that ben and jen flop earlier this summer the order was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot now i m a heath ledger fan things i hate about you a knight s tale and particularly his supporting role in monster s ball but my man needs to find himself a better agent keep accepting scripts like the order and four feathers and he s going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion here are the problems i had with the film firstly the director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with well much of anything plot skeins involving the american trying to take over the vatican and the dark pope while mildly interesting did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters the attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best secondly please don t insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory we had manufactured angst manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of matrix reloaded with skull numbing techno music rather than developing character these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were a half hearted attempt at putting popcorn chewing adolescents in the seats thirdly and most importantly this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept we have scandal we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone s background we learn a little about alex but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past and alex is the most developed if you can call it that character in the entire film as the cliche goes nowadays if you re going to see one movie this year make sure it s not this one there s about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable minute affair the only thing that saved me was going with a girl who i m rather fond of out of i m disappointed file this one firmly under had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing heath my man go back to monster s ball like cameos they really suit you 
my friends and i walked out after minutes and we weren t the first afterwards we tried to get our money back movie theater management wouldn t allow this but they did agree to let us see another film the only time that worked for us was to see dickie roberts former child star as you can tell this wasn t a memorable night probably one of my worst movie nights close second has to be when i saw a double header of domestic disturbance and heist in conclusion for the sake of humanity please don t see the order 
what was the worst movie of cat in the hat gigli mais non i propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year badly written badly edited and if i may be so bold badly acted the order is the black hole of film a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck it isn t even accidentally funny like for example showgirls you know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn t going to be very smart they renamed the movie originally titled the sin eaters because they figured americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie instead they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of heath ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there and hey what do you know they were right my ex girlfriend saw the picture of heath and dragged me in congratulations producers you ve met your target market she also liked grease ii so you re in good company back on topic heath plays a catholic monk from a specific you guessed it order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor he has celibacy issues possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion much less be a celibate monk the only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy as much as i ve wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of monty python thinking that if they just said the lines like the pythons did they would automatically be funny you know the sort of people i m talking about if i utter any more i would be in danger of generating spoilers frankly the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created 
the turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide there was no real suspense most of the characters were insipid the chesty irish priest was as lame as the love interest interest is misleading the girl that they chose to provide the film s sensuality might be better the central conflict of the main character was uninvolving this film is entirely devoid of positives it is like a tedious exercise by someone who didn t want to go to the gym that day but did anyway 
horrible waste of time bad acting plot directing this is the most boring movie ever there are bad movies that are fun freddy vs jason and there are bad movies that are horrible this one fits into the latter bottom line don t waste your time 
the screenwriter poorly attempted to re create the exorcist but put in some blah blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged there is no substance whatsoever in this entire film it had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about extremely boring i wanted to leave the theater when i saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so i had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about they use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me as it intended i hate cgi just ruined the movie even more some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how thought provoking and slow paced without action because it s an intelligent film it was what is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion seems like an uninspired concept oh and there s some mumbo jumbo about the sin eater movie was originally going to be titled sin eater lame concept but the movie took the sin eater thing too seriously making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was yeah i know there were really sin eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget why i even bothered to see this movie if you want horror films that actually have depth watch rosemary s baby the tenant naked blood society cannibal holocaust pin exorcist omen or any of the romero dead trilogy films nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people mainstream movie fans think that though same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece if you want mind numbingly boring horror watch the order this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride 
yeah well i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little yet very long movie apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life here s the epitome of the antihero in no regrets we have this jerk so messed up so wandering so selfish aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman s up and coming son jaemin unless it was just that physical attraction he claims otherwise that it s love but after watching this it s like loving charles manson because you dig the beard alright he s not that bad but still no real redeemable characteristics i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalks sumin it was never shown just told that jaemin loves sumin perhaps it s a culture thing that flew over my head crazy stalking mad love over in seoul it has to be because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy i was waiting for a tiger named baby to make an appearance okay so sumin works two jobs while going to school so far so good on someone trying to better themselves but after his first taste of his stalker s attraction he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring what ok well as previously mentioned the obsession doesn t stop due to the job career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup basic movie not terrible but you can do better with foreign gay themed movies 
as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released sadly it was a huge disappointment then so i left it alone for years before going back to watch it again but it was no better the second time mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester the penchant for slapstick spoilt the three musketeers for me and the same applies here to me the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts but they are adventure novels there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has after all he is involved in dangerous situations this is conveyed in the novels but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book when i first read that the book was to be filmed the article said that the film was to star oliver reed i rejoiced as reed to me was the epitome of flashman how i would have loved to see him in the role malcolm mcdowell is a good actor but does not fit the visual image of flashman created by the books too scrawny looking flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet tom bell a great shame as the production values costumes sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is as a recent radio adaptation of flash for freedom adapted by mr fraser worked quite well perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen 
raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend dick foran thanks to his affection for his friend s wife angela lansbury this was a full year before he started doing perry mason so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting there isn t all that much else here that s interesting though lansbury is always good but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious there s an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter who s also in love with the femme fatale but the burr character is pretty straightforward it s frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films i ve seen him in there s no mystery at all really and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burr s character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder presumably he does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn t notice when she comes into the room i guess a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv 
the premise of this movie was decent enough but with sub par acting it was just bland and dull spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death it was accidental so although it was a murder it wasn t like the guy set out to do it also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree there is no emotion in this film the first minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister and hearing her message it was dull and boring with some polishing and better acting it could have been pretty good 
ok i watch a lot of bad movies i pride myself on that fact many times there are some gems in the b rated bombs but this movie is one of the worst i have watched i like a good horror movie but one with a plot of and sense of movement the opening scenes seemed pretty good decent music and imagery then it goes down hill from there one of the main characters has a disability ringing in the ears called tinnitus now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret they made that too much of a focus of the movie so what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn t have been no need to keep bringing it up so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her well after seeing her sister over and over again as a zombie like ghost and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her bad thing is that she didn t have much of a plan only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped the idiot didn t even believe he killed her so all is revealed there and even though she had a gun somehow she manages to get herself strangled so the last scenes of the movie are of the spirits of her and her twin walking out of the water so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins and not one but two innocent people die good things about the movie imagery bad things about the movie music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors
i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago first i m going to say that it looks great cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks i would not call this a horror movie putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie there s no mystery there s no suspense you know who did it the entire time it s a drama you know what s going on with both sides the entire movie the acting was okay i guess but nothing special and the tagline revenge can be deadly really they should have check how many hundreds of horror thriller movies have that exact same tagline it pains me to say some of this but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie and i know they don t want people blowing smoke up their ass so i give my honest opinion 
okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn t you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her and at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her proof i don t know i was not happy with the ending this movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy 
just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home she then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why this is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn t quite i can t really put my finger on why it didn t work but it was good enough that i kind of wished it was better or at least had gotten the little things right like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size i think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong 
this movie isn t worth the film it was photographed on the dialog is flat filled with clich overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time the choppy shaky film style is a cheap imitation of the the ring style visual effects the characters do not even act like a normal person would for example the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn t even once call out her sister s name to see if she is home what you would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her way too many flashbacks to her childhood too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director it is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street up the driveway around this corner over here over there oh a side view now a front view enough already you would think you are watching a tv commercial for the solaris terrible movie out of i really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it 
for a film with so much promise it was disappointing thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable the plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it s the worst clich d ending i ve seen in a movie for some time the final scene would have ripped my heart out if the entire movie hadn t been so painful to begin with i was numb from the very first scene one was left wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting i ve seen to date it was a horror in the true sense of the word 
lolita is a rebel and she s going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories between sci fi and fantasy well this surrender cinema production is not very good very bad acting horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line but the sex scenes are pretty well done lot of lesbian scenes and jacqueline lovell as beautiful as in the exotic house of wax offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show for lovell s fans only 
cybil richards directs another full moon surrender cinema masterpiece of erotica this time jacqualine lovell dressed in rather fetching silver outfit is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity however she can t resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them the sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack at least for this sort of film the cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too jacqueline lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below she also fits in a little lesbian activity to be honest lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the drama utterly rubbish movie with lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features mediocre even for surrender s output and clearly a new budget low for them also 
this movie was bad beyond belief i saw it during the san francisco film festival before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before which happened to be its world premiere i don t think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point we all understood by the end its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie paige in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie paige movies the movie is only minutes long and the content of those minutes is sub par to say the least a scene would start going then someone would say wow you re so great bettie why don t we make another movie this would be followed by a minutes of a bettie paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as and even more boring than the normal part of the movie by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie paige movie remake came up it was that ludicrous i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre but people were not laughing with the movie maker they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory i know movies are expensive i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen the movie looks like it was made for the cuts the graininess and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience this movie makes dude where s my car look like citizen kane my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid dollars to be tortured the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good apparently the previous night the night of the world premiere the director writer producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie bettie paige s movies were destroyed they should destroy this movie too 
the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script it plods back and forth between vignettes of bettie s story and re creations of the klaw short films while the klaw re creations are well done it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety page richards while not an amazing actress does a decent job overall and at times she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie also of note is some faithful attention to detail costumes and clothing well done as is some of the set direction the sets are generally sparse and feel stage y but do feel of the era it is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color palette was clearly thought out to give the overall look a vibrant retro feel 
they made me watch this in school and it was terrible the movie is outdated the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting the teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life this accounts for cheesy acting very often also very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far fetched i don t like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them though it was written to be educational funny suspenseful and hip it ended up being boring dry far fetched and old i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it 
the acting is some of the worst i ve ever seen the characters are totally unconvincing this could be overlooked to some extent if the plot was interesting which the plot to the prodigy was not it s sort of a bad mix between fresh and animal house except that both of those movies were good 
in sixth grade every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester every class had something to do with this terrible show we watched it in english and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters in math we talked about charts and other sea crap in science we talked about whales which was actually somewhat interesting so this wasn t a waste of time all day everyday was torture not only that but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well i could see if this was a new series or something but it was like i m still trying to block this out 
as far as i can tell you in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors this film is currently available on dvd i found it only a few weeks ago it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of cents plus tax for it i found it at a cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks now don t you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had i thought so this film was indeed well worth cents cents i might start to argue with you but clearly worth cents and remember that saying about getting what you pay for for slasher film mavens only 
this movie is a bad to alright rip off of friday the th the movie is about a killer named bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp he kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother another f th take off the intro is seeing bernie killing his first victims then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son later we learn that his son is bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute he sets bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on this movie is only recommended to those who enjoy b grade s slashers 
as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment although the acting and the production values aren t bad the script is awful the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children i can hardly believe how regressive it is in it s view of women has the writer been living under a rock although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen i wouldn t suggest this movie to anyone it s terrible it s an embarrassment to the city it s named after 
i went to see this film with low expectations but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film sadly that s about all i got the story covers familiar territory the high school reunion but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well worn theme though the quality of the acting was good overall the content of the film was appalling the sexism of the film was blatant women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married procreating or both though this was couched as a post feminist choice worse still was the racism the shrill jewish mother the black man who still lives at home and gratuitous cruelty tormenting the class geek we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen 
by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing you know the type funny but supposed to frighten you this was not funny or horrific the writing was lame the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness they were so expected the actors didn t even do much with such a not so good script at least i hope that wasn t their best watch this movie at your own risk i give it negative stars outta 
i didn t know it was possible to release a movie this bad the labeling sounded so promising but you would think that with a cast of at least one of them would be able to act my wife left me and went to bed after the first minutes she made a wise decision 
if you are looking for eye candy you may enjoy sky captain sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie now saying that the visuals are the only thing good in sky captain after ten minutes i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time i was hoping this movie would get better but it never achieved any degree of interest after thirty minutes the urge to walk out kept growing and growing now i own over movies and have seen probably five times that number yet this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire life acting there is none the three main performers are pitiful jude law also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on is just awful in the title role i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law again paltrow tries so hard to be campy that it backfires in her face the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting after this performance i would applaud that decision story soap operas are better written the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses directing none everything was put into the special effects that story acting and directing suffer greatly even the phantom menace had better acting and that is not saying a great deal i would have to give this movie a out of avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release 
in short this movie is completely worthless the idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early s might think of the future an interesting idea but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief so the idea just flops apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed but as a graphics person the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening the color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality and i don t understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking if anything the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics they don t measure up even to the ancient jurassic park graphics the models for the robots were so simple plain and very uncompelling there were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric like animals on that island but they are not explained in any way the story is horrible beyond belief in fact i can t believe i didn t just walk out of this movie the relationship between polly and joe is unmotivated and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception why is the morris paley character even there we are not in any way convinced that joe is heroic i mean he flies a plane and saved one person polly for personal reasons yeah there s a great hero for you dex has very little screen time so why are we supposed to care about joe wanting to save him who were the nepalease that locked joe and polly in the mine vault and why would they do it remembering that the entire totenkopf operation was robotic plot holes why did bai ling s character a major fall from her excellent character in the crow halt the robots who had captured joe they were looking for the vials and had not found them why in the hell would dex be captured but not killed he doesn t have or know about the vials and the bad guys didn t know that polly had the vials and was connected to joe and therefore to dex polly indicates that they don t know anything about totenkopf yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete fbi style file on him the blank spot on the map as described by the nepalese if they know all about this mysterious area then why the hell is their map blank in that spot at one point polly and joe have to give up their clothes they are burned joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes yet polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress then in the same line of continuity suddenly polly has her original clothes back sigh how far off am i supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap we are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen and the acting we re supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad british accents which character isn t annoying i think ling bai s dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie she doesn t have a single line the dialogue wasn t camp and doesn t even rise to the level of cheese its just bad and annoying these people aren t hero s or compelling they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life i can t believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb imho it should be competing with batman forever in the bottom of all time 
the exploding zeppelins crashing down upon sky captain jude law s base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is first off let me state right off the bat that i sincerely doubt that paramount will ever recover any money from this film a cult hit it might become but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve i can see the studio pitch now let s combine s german expressionism and a s globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene wow won t that be a success skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess there are too many fake explosions too many unconvincing dogfight scenes and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully two dimensional after all why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three or five or one hundred moreover what could have been a groundbreaking film seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using cgi quite simply the graphics are amazingly poor from the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights everything seems to be just a little off i m not being nit picky here in any way an infant could notice that a car doesn t glide along the road like a maglev train unless its a mercedes s and for those of you raising your voices in protest crying out this is a stylized film it s not supposed to be like reality let me just say this lord of the rings has set the standard for integrating real life actors with cgi starship troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films the rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the s back into the hollywood film portfolio and tim burton s batman created a unique picture of new york city gotham that has yet to be repeated sky captain falls so short of all these films it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence plus the acting is so poor it makes me positively ill so there you have it i spent to see this film and you get my review i hope it might dissuade you all from making the same mistake that i did 
a gave it a instead of a awful because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork but that wasn t enough to save it the sepia toned washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies nothing new there i can see there were some hat tips to other old classic movies ok no problem with that but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting not something that would put you to sleep the story line and the script of this movie was awful the characters two dimensional slow moving some of the scenes were pretty to look at but ultimately as a whole it was quite boring i couldn t recommend it 
sky captain is possibly the best awful movie i ve seen in a long while rife with amazing cg and special effects studded with an a list cast jude law gwyneth paltrow angelina jolie and the infinitely likable giovanni ribisi and racing along with an overused but indiana jones esquire storyline this should have been a great movie to watch should have being the key term here of course jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over the shoulder heart melting smirks but you can t make something out of nothing and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can t save the movie s stone dialogue if he had slapped giovanni ribisi on the back and said good boy dex just one more time i might have barfed all over the guy in front of me gwyneth paltrow as polly perkins is nothing less than nerve grating her nasal whining and not quite sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical s comic book heroine who knows i expected more from her an example of how a similar character was played and played well is in the late s flick the phantom starring kristy swanson and billy zane rent the movie and you ll know what i mean giovanni ribisi and angelina jolie were the saving graces in the film angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch i ll admit it in just a few short scenes both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry two dimensional castmates the plot and steady story progression were old boring and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years the pace is rapid fire in the first half of the movie and a snail s pace in the second giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film but to figure out who the key villain is as well the pairing is rather clich d also polly perkins and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly ended romance and their story isn t so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film nobody s surprised and nobody really cares either props to the director for appreciating bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout but sky captain despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie falls flat on its face not even worth the i paid to get into the theater 
visually interesting but falls flat in the originality department this tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle jude law has the charisma of burnt toast but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen on the big screen in fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film and had me thinking about work bills my dogs etc there are many moments that scream bluescreen paltrow is as wooden as they get this could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp my only complaint on the technique is that black white film sorry computer would of helped because it looks like turner colorized black and white just a big dull clich mess i would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again 
in a word this film was boring it lacked life and spark a big problem is with the two leads jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever he was boring and she was annoying the visuals were interesting but they didn t enhance the scenes if anything the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen none of the action sequences felt real and hence the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger the film had potential but it needed a better script better acting and a better director i kept thinking during the film you know this movie would ve worked if harrison ford was sky captain karen allen was polly and steven spielberg was the director ignore the critical acclaims for this film the critics i think are praising the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels 
this movie feels so empty in every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird the acting was horrible it s so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives looking at the floor for their marks spoilers also you ll find yourself banging your head watching the movie at one point at sky captain s home base they have like planes sitting on the airstrip they have advanced warning an attack is coming so what do they do nothing all of the planes get blown up and yet again the only person fighting back is the sky captain the entire world is under attack and he s the only person ever fighting back at the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally but what do they do nothing the movie is over 
i went to school with jeremy earl that is how i heard of this movie i don t really know if it was in the theater s at all i don t recall the name i have seen it it is like one of those after school specials the acting is ok not great the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny so the only comment i can give this movie is eh i borrowed the movie from jeremy if i was in a movie rental place this is one that i would walk past and after watching it i wouldn t recommend it to anyone past middle school age i ve also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed the slang is overused or just outdated many times i think thats what makes their characters unbelievable 
to start with i have to point out the fact that you re gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour yeah some things happen but you don t know why or what for when you finally figure things out you just realize that it s nothing but a twisted soad opera dealing with mature prostitutes dead mothers illegitimate sons the characters are rather poor and the actors specially the young ones don t help that much to make em look credible only marisa paredes stands out but she s a superb actress no matter if the movie is pure rubbish the only positive things to say about fr o sol de invierno is that d butant pablo malo seems to have good intentions and he s filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense well maybe the next time my rate 
okay so there aren t really that many great movies around recent gems like american dream the straight story and even toy story don t normally come so close together but boy does this film counter balance the quality i have no idea what these people thought they were doing are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to fund such a crock of i can just see it now producer so we ve got joe fiennes he s cute as a button and was pretty good in shakespeare in love and we ve got rhys ifans who isn t cute but was cool in notting hill we ll mix in a really mediocre score a few forgettable post britpop tunes hemlock root and lizard brains and hey presto you ve got the worst film of the new millennium and believe me it s gonna be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years the bank i like it any unnecessary sex bad camera movements and what about the worst accents this side of devil s own producer yeah we got plenty of those the bank sounds great where do we sign please 
i rented this thinking it might be interesting and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner hard to follow strange editing disjointed storyline the characters mumble all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time i just couldn t get into it and didn t care what happened to the characters not even ian holm could save this film unless you need a cure for insomnia i d skip it and that s being generous 
i have seen bad films but this took the p made no sense and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds oh and i think one has a low sperm count its that good a welshman plays a sweary cockney a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy and some lesser lights play dim tarts and there are some russian gangsters oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs avoid this film like the plague 
we know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie a waste of time the premise was not too bad but one workable idea interaction between real bussinessmen and russian mafia is not followed by an intelligent script
 the first film i had to walk out on and it was the cast and crew pre screening not that i was involved i hasten to add i made it through the first hour so i reckon i m just qualified to comment but that was my limit like other comments here how did this get through any kind of qa an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue the epitome of wooden acting awful casting all wrapped together without a plot tara fitzgerald s casting was bizarre almost comic she possesses the worst russian accent in movie history as i left the screening the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema they obviously couldn t sit through it again either 
i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad that has been done in great detail already many times over the plot started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide boy gangster by numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves it is now or years since i watched it during its week run at the cinema before it was pulled yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seen i am only making these comments and indeed the only reason i went to see the film is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second heavy in the pub scene it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifan s face in the bar in russia it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever he had recently joined an extras agency and this was his first part having seen the film it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever i remember there were about people in the whole cinema and this was just a couple of days after it had been released i have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast and rightly so in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red hot then jam them into your eye sockets this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film 
words really can t describe how bad this film is i thought zandalee was bad but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off this is just laughable terrible script poor direction awful acting and you know what i can t think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn t too long if you want minutes worth of entertainment book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work far more enjoyable and much better value for money assuming that you need it incidentally i need to type lines of text to complete this review please do not buy this movie it is terrible 
boring and appallingly acted summer pheonix she sounded more asian than jewish some of the scenes and costumes looked more mid th century than late th century what on earth fine actors like ian holm anton lesser were doing in this is beyond me 
i have given this film an elevated rating of stars as i personally appear in minutes and of the film the road side bar scene in russia in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line dollars you drink and talk but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could so i declined to take this speaking part on i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience and who knows these lines could have ended up there with lines such as i ll be back and quite frankly my dear i don t give a damn had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as heavy instead of the name of ryszard janikowski as time goes on i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film even though i spent a whole day on the set in south wales hot spot barry island no one could tell me what the actual storyline was the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it things could certainly have been worse if i d ended up naked in this most dreadful of films still on the positive side i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break i had no idea who he was as notting hill was yet to be released and not an inkling that he might be welsh made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the s and s it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production 
i usually try to construct reasonably well argued critiques of films but i can not believe this got past the script stage the dialogue is appalling the acting very dodgy the accents just awful and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best i don t remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad joseph fiennes pretty as he is might just have killed his career as quickly as it started the island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage 
i read james hawes book it was pretty neat not great but entertaining enough without having read the book i wouldn t have had the slightest idea what was going on and it was still a stretch with that knowledge literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways i do not have the capacity to describe half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick never before or since as a film made me feel so angry the mattress sequels came closest but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did since wasting minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind i am now unable to even look at any book by james hawes without feeling angry that is the depth of hatred i have for this piece of sh t no that s unfair let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is rancid aluminium plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema 
this movie was one of the worst i ve ever seen pure drivel how anyone could develop a connection with the heroine or have empathy for her is beyond me i felt i was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder just terrible in its most generous light this can be seen as an attempt at producing and art film except i could not for the life of me find any art in it at all if this woman had lived in todays world she would have been whisked off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with anti psychotic medications that or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristics she had that made her worth that effort 
cornel wilde and three dumbbells search for sunken treasure in the south atlantic the treasure hunters led by wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little sneers on their hungry faces wilde and his merry men must find a way to take themselves off the menu so they can begin excavating an old spanish galleon filled with gold bullion after the crew engages in a small eternity of pushing shoving arguing and listening to wilde s annoying health tips crazy convicts board the boat and complicate things now it is a battle of wits as to who gets the treasure and who gets to see what the inside of a shark s stomach looks like at least wilde is in shape wearing exactly the same thing he wore in the naked prey years earlier and he has remained in excellent condition made on a budget of cents 
this movie was a real torture fest to sit through its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self evidently a bad thing that it barely needs to convince the audience of it when it does stoop to putting in its argument it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts all that s missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children while watching this movie i kept thinking where d you hear that or that can t possibly be true yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources and bless em the regular folks in the movie came across more like luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power to be fair that might be the fault of the film makers but equally fairly it s a condition shared by the movie s rock stars as for the performers now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music i ve enjoyed and i m sure a few of them really did believe in this cause but they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the s have passed them by particularly embarrassing are graham nash and james taylor nash seems to be trying too hard he looks like he can t possibly believe the things he s being told not that i blame him but desperate to feel noticed and included james taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever stand and fight in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine in fact most of the performances are pretty bland when they re not being patronizing nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesn t mean much to them at all it s worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be john hall of the band orleans and responsible for some of the wimpiest mor pop of the s remember if you dare dance with me and still the one it s worth noting because that s symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music the cause is supposedly life or death but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they re playing the catskills except maybe gil scott heron his protest number we almost lost detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the smugness of a high schooler impressed with how controversial he s being only bruce springsteen s performance raises a pulse i ve never been a big fan of the boss but he absolutely smokes no question part of me thinks he was taped separately at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience compared to the general blandness and air of self satisfaction here it s no wonder bruce was hailed as the savior of rock n roll but even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting i don t expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by split second cutaways to a back up singer s tonsils now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with and maybe the film makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage but all you have to do is watch rust never sleeps or the last waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill and with more exciting musicians so really there s only two things to watch this movie for springsteen s stellar performance and as a sad snapshot about a counter culture in decline 
i understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent i have sat through many movies that don t particularly hold my interest but i can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children s activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children s movies disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name technically the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over dubbed and unnatural personally i hate that but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a year old for a school project the acting reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices thankfully it was a very short movie now before i come off like a video geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick the one thing that can save even the worst children s movie is a positive message far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given if you are lost don t worry you will inevitably find your way home approach wild animals without any fear you can win any competition just because you know you can and my favorite the final message left in the film it s okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right 
this extremely weak australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the pavlov dog experiment amongst horror movies you remember this famous conditioned reflex experiment from your school books right the russian scientist pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animal s reflexes pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and after a while he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell what the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low budgeted aussie slasher flick i hear you think well the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in nightmares is an exact variant on pavlov s experiment each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window because he she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims so this means that after a short while inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass that way they still don t miss anything special regarding the quality of nightmares as a film i can be very brief this is a cheap uninspired and largely imbecilic aussie cash in on the contemporary popular trend of american slasher movies in the early s a four year old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident twenty years later the same girl helen selleck is a successful stage actress but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares she auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part shortly after the big premiere everyone who s even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered it is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killer s identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already i don t think i ve ever seen a more obvious whodunit than nightmares and the creators should have just showed his her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment the murders are explicit and very bloody and there s also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to enjoy however the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative the few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage the only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do nightmares is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema but hey at least i gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible 
jenny neumann from the sexploitation flick mistress of the apes the american slasher hell night and others is helen selleck an american actress who gets a lead role in an australian stage production she s a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her meanwhile a black gloved killer prowls around the theater slashing up people with shards of glass major spoiler the killer is obviously helen she speaks in her dead mother s voice washes blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a little girl but this has gratuitous heavy breathing pov camera work and conceals the identity of the murderer until the very end like it s supposed to be some big surprise the entire cast seems obsessed with talking about having or trying to have sex and in one case even blackmailing their way into getting laid there s quite a bit of nudity and blood but there s no sense of continuity the photography is murky and the editing by colin eggleston who also scripted and produced is terrible the theater setting for a slasher film predates soavi s film of the same name and argento s opera both of which are better than this one by five years though and neumann is pretty hot 
the mummy s tomb starts with a review of the events in the mummy s hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the united states of america where the current high priest and the mummy kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past while i absolutely loved the mummy with boris karloff as the mummy imhotep and quite liked the mummy s hand with tom tyler as kharis which is the direct prequel to this film i was not as taken with the mummy s tomb it is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting lon chaney jr is okay as kharis but doesn t really stand out and i guess that s my main criticism of this movie that nothing really stands out there s nothing really terrible here but nothing really outstanding either so the viewer is left with a rather bland mummy s tale 
 st watched out of dir harold young the rd universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer s perspective the story is similar and the results are ho hum this time the story s location is the u s as the egyptian priest s new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb this time the mummy is played by lon chaney which doesn t make much of a difference because he s really not asked to do much acting for this character the new priest becomes a morgue keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice again a girl gets in the way as the priest falls for one of the descendent s fianc and wants her yes to be immortal with him haven t we heard this before the plan is of course thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches similar to the frankenstein monster and the burning of the creature ends the story how do they get a sequel i guess you ll find out with the next one in the series or not 
this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died idaho colorado territories and montana it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious bad man good man the script is horrible there is very little direction and lousy acting dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade in real life jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city montana to insure that he could never terrorize them again vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately this is a horrible movie i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will even to this day 
back again in scotland lassie is again on trial for her life because the faithful dog sleeps on her master s grave she must be put to death according to law oddly it is also explained that lassie had no legal owner which is apparently also against an old scottish law if after three days no owner is located dogs must be destroyed edmund gwenn as john traill pleads lassie s case which leads to an extended flashback showing lassie s adoption by donald crisp as john jock gray although it s based on an interesting original story greyfriars bobby challenge to lassie revisits several earlier lassie situations and it does not improve upon them comparatively speaking this one is sloppy and unexciting and it s a disappointing follow up to the sun comes up geraldine brooks as susan brown and several of the other performers may be charming but can t elevate this one little jimmy hawkins from it s a wonderful life is among the notable children supporting lassie much later he will grow up to marry dark shadows bewitching angelique lara parker 
bad plot though good for a b movie good fast paced fight scenes at most a out of but something has always bothered me about this film how come mariska hargitay never speaks in the tv version she shares several intimate moments with jeff speakman even a kiss in a garden yet in the regular video version most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all this bothers me because it not only takes out a female though cliched point of view to the film it also makes the final shot seem creepy this film would have been better had they kept her scenes in because in those scenes at least she has a personality one that undercuts whatever speakman says 
overlong drama that isn t capable of making any real point so she became an actress so what she learned to love big deal there is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations but the kind which is bad for the movie causing it to often seem absurd summer phoenix playing the lead talks and behaves like a semi retarded person so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater which was clearly not the intended point we are told early on in that barry lyndon like narration that she learned to hide her emotions which certainly explains her autistic stone face but the movie suffers for it she basically walks around like a zombie and her success as an actress isn t quite credible given her lack of emotions occasionally the movie had that dull sleepy feel of a dogma movie is it one i wouldn t be at all surprised summer phoenix is sister of joaquim phoenix and the late river phoenix nepotism rarely works if you d like to see my hollywood nepotism list with over pictures entries contact me by e mail 
this movie is probably the worst i have seen bad acting bad script bad everything comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting both cyborg van damme and nemesis olivier gruner are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it s albert pyun who has directed these two as well the story is not original the world has become a terrible place possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war and people live under medieval circumstances a special breed of robots cyborgs live on human blood and there s the story the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there prophecy and the humans need someone to stop them one girl together with a robot kris kristofferson built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind in this movie the director tries some hong kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far the movie fails miserably in this attempt i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new worst ever movie to relate to and to fans of the genre i recommend cyborg since i think it s a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor and if you can t stand van damme then check out nemesis i rated this movie 
still a sucker for pyun s esthetic sense i liked this movie though the unfinished ending was a let down as usual pyun develops a warped sense of humour and kathy long s fights are extremely impressive beautifully photographed this has the feel it was done for the big screen 
once in a while you get amazed over how bad a film can be and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap there is absolutely no talent included in this film from a crappy script to a crappy story to crappy acting amazing 
a shame that even a talented director desplechin could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly talented actress phoenix esther kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot in an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor s plight the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer in an overly long running time the redundancy of esther s struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out desplechin s instruction just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same never feeling a convincing victory over esther s pain we never feel a victory in phoenix s talent 
you can t really go far when the initial story isn t all that great the premise of cyborg s needing blood is just dopey the script is blas the actors don t have much to work with the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs it s a trademark that if the background is the desert then the movie has no budget lack of budget is okay if there s a story solarbabies and blood of champions are examples of decent work from no but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich again forgivable if only the story didn t just plain suck finally this movie commits the biggest crime of all it doesn t finish it simply ends as if it s a commercial break away from the rest of the movie but the rest never comes just odd just bad 
this movie will promote the improvement of the mind read a book it s incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make i ve seen b movies before but the c movie has just been invented i didn t think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into knights high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind my roommate who loves these types of movies even turned it off now that has to really tell you something if you watch this movie and like it i will pray for you 
in the ravaged wasteland of the future mankind is terrorized by cyborgs robots with human features that have discovered a new source of fuel human blood commanded by their vicious leader j b lance henriksen the cyborgs prepare to overtake taos a densely populated human outpost only one force can stop j b s death march the cyborg gabriel kris kristofferson who is programmed to destroy j b and his army in the ruins of a ransacked village gabriel finds nea kathy long a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by cyborgs ten years earlier now she wants revenge they strike a pact gabriel will train nea how to fight the cyborgs and nea will lead gabriel to taos five time kick boxing champion kathy long has all the right moves in this high speed adventure that delivers plenty of action also stars gary daniels as david and scott paulin as simon 
every once in a while i will rent an action adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important this is why i own a copy of charlie s angels not a quality film but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while one of these days i will probably buy copies of the princess bride and a few monty python movies for much the same reason in any case i rented this film because i wanted to be entertained without being challenged for the most part i got what i wanted the plot was something along the lines of a poorly written xena episode and the kathy long s acting was very community theater not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress there were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys unfortunately most of them die pretty darned quick like most martial arts films the further you get into the movie the more emphasis there is on action and the plot which wasn t strong to begin with deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting however the more kathy long fights the more time the director devotes to her backside by the end of the movie i was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times kathy long s tight red shorts were center screen unfortunately there just wasn t enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time if you are a hard core xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours by all means go to the grocery store and spend the cents on the rental there are some strong similarities between the show and this movie just don t expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours unless of course you happen to like kathy long s derri re then you might want to purchase a copy 
 giant is one of the most boring overly long hollywood contraptions ever many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy rock hudson elizabeth taylor and james dean are wasted in this big hollywood production a central notion to this movie that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land is absurd and i know this because i m from houston a couple of scenes especially dean serving taylor coffee redeem this otherwise boring film for a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how modernism changed the ranches in texas see hud one of paul newman s great performances or the last picture show 
with all due disrespect for this george stevens sr epic of miscastings and misreadings i can only wonder that the james dean legend could survive this outing i submit that then studio obeisances to bankable box office giants came a cropper of its own gigantismoses nor were rock and liz that much better off let us just say that the televised dallas was the authentic heir even if contemp tuous latterday texans like lay and delay not to mention our putative president of these here yewbenighted states of amurrika perform a one upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions i never read edna ferber s original but will lay odds it is head and shoulders superior to what got on screen herein and all those well paid i would imagine supporting actors of note and celebrity notwithstanding giant is to me at least a midget of scant merit never mind the promo campaigns 
as big as a texas prairie and equally as boring even liz taylor james dean chill wills and dennis hopper can t float this overbloated boat taylor actually looks bad wrong wardrobe wrong hair and wrong makeup a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career hopper gives the only believable performance and dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually don t remember him for a comic actor rock hudson is his usual prototype of barbie doll ken and makes one wonder what a say redford could have done with the male lead there is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other except for hopper there is no character development only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery to its credit the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects and it does have size making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests those with the dvd version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk you won t be missing anything of interest 
here s yet another blasphemous european story in which they blast the religion of their country these atheist filmmakers are relentless here we see a brutal blasting of catholics and or the catholic clergy and i am not catholic this won actually won an academy award for bes foreign film that s probably because the story made catholics and religious belief in general look extremely weak one of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else he s portrayed as nothing but an idiot no wonder the secular dominated academy loved this movie also there is some overacting fool who plays a guy who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story the daughters take turns seducing the seminary student who states he studied for six years but says he s an agnostic i mean how blasphemous is this film this is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secular progressive bigotry of the film business worldwide not just hollywood 
things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by spike lee bleek gilliam denzell washington is a happenin jazz trumpeter that fronts a quintet packing them in at below the underdog his problems include an incompetent manager a stage hogging sax player and two girlfriends that he s playing musical mattress with the real love of his life though is his trumpet and his music the band s manager giant has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and would be best jettisoned but bleek remains loyal for as long as possible it will prove to his undoing as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man as bleek denzell washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpeter with a babe on each arm he s too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art dispensing patience and love to those close to him with a low key remoteness he simply lacks the fire wesley snipes who plays henderson the sax player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the flaccid throw away scribblings of lee s torpid dialogue as giant lee hits the trifecta with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction loosely attempting to mirror the grubby but sympathetic ratso rizzo to bleek s joe buck he adopts a limp and even the i m walkin here moment from midnight cowboy in this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it lee s script is all tepid argument heavy handed ribbing and veiled insult with some requisite clumsy editorializing that lee has to inject to remain down the scenes between the band members backstage and in rehearsal lack spark and are only surpassed in dreariness by the bleek giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go in circles completing this travesty is lee s pretentious visual style tracking shots zooms and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes they just wander blues is lee s love letter to jazz made implicit by the mountains of memorabilia plastered all over the sets and it s all sentimental clap trap that lacks passion and verve jazz on film is better served by tavernier s round midnight and eastwood s bird which get below the surface reveal more sides of the form the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by forrest whitaker and the real deal dexter gordon this spike lee joint doesn t even offer a mild buzz it s some pretty bad homegrown 
there are two groups of people those who love every fellini movie they see and normal people while i will admit that i have really enjoyed some of his films i can also honestly say that i can t stand some of them my opinion by the way is not just some knee jerk reaction i have seen most of fellini s films and have also seen many films by the world s most famous directors with this in mind i feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both godard and fellini they both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the intelligensia while the average person would never sit through some of their films heck even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films so since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses it s not surprising that their films are so often praised it s like a cult if you don t believe me think about many of godard s films such as first name carmen or alphaville or what about fellini satyricon or juliet of the spirits these films abound with boredom weirdness and incomprehensibility now i am not saying a film can t be weird after all i love happiness of the katakuris and shaolin soccer but it must be watchable now on to this movie somehow fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy this is no small task it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable instead of cheap sexual thrills the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that donald sutherland looks like a ghoul i know some of this must have been fellini s intention but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance especially since sutherland s lines are all poorly dubbed into italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself unfortunately when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades there really isn t anything else to watch an interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of fellini s wife giulietta masina considering that in addition to this that in previous decades fellini had masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen i read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well this is about the only aspect of this turgid film that i found at all interesting don t say i didn t warn you 
this is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made even for fellini about the only one more bizarre is his satyricon this is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence opulence and sexual challenge sutherland makes a curiously unappealing casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover s autobiography fail to engage the viewer the art direction and costume design are however outstanding the academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an oscar for the latter also nominated oddly was the disjointed pointless and almost inacessible screenplay go figure the film on video is only minutes minutes short of the original running time this viewer was grateful 
i should explain why i gave this piece of art star rating out of possible simply because it s hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased probably it would have been the same if i had given it explanations anyway would have followed i am not fond of these pointless gore movies like hostel or so i think that s disgusting and pretty terrible in all the possible contextual meanings but as i found out after watching this movie there is a genre called historical drama and probably it would have been the case of as it has plenty of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it and made kill bill to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible but the thing about historical drama genre is that it s a sub category of the trash movies where john romero is the undead gory emperor of the guts and so automatically it can t be rated as your default movie as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you can t really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so or it was simply bad it s for the people who like to enjoy bad acting bad screenplay and bad everything else and by some turn of faith i am one of them too there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go the day is saved but that s definitely an opinion of mine and doesn t have match with anyones else what i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie then fellini s casanova is definitely the choice but heed my advice and don t rate it by default means 
i was very unimpressed with cinderella and jungle book but this is possibly worse than both titles first of all i didn t like the animation very saturday morning cartoon only worse in some scenes i liked some of the characters namely thunderbolt and patch but the other characters like cruella were mediocre cruella was truly villainous in the original but she lost her quality in the sequel what she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly also her artist companion lars was a joke to be honest with you and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight the voice talents were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt with the exception of jodi benson the accent ruined it for me there were some good moments but the whole plot seemed bloated for me and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode all in all a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the s disney movies along with jungle book sorry i can only give this a it just wasn t my cup of tea bethany cox
cult of the cobra is now available on dvd in a pristine print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie unfortunately that is not saying much it has a competent cast of second rankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances it is efficiently directed entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot it looks ok but is ponderously over plotted and at a scant minutes it is still heavily padded for example the double cobra attack on the first of the gis was surely one attack too many the business about julia choosing to marry pete rather than tom never amounts to anything tom immediately falls in love with lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of julia nor is she julia s feminine intuition is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development but it doesn t similarly pete s investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time these are just symptoms of the underlying problem the movie is structured like a mystery but it isn t as soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already know the ending is particularly lame julia is menaced purely by accident lisa has no reason to want to kill her she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when tom turns up in the nick of time to save her it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all he then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done it is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that i found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads then it occurred to me someone said those val lewton movies were very successful over at rko so why don t we make one like that cult of the cobra is clearly modelled on cat people mysterious troubled shape shifting woman falls in love with the hero is apparently frigid kills people arouses the suspicions of the hero s woman friend and dies at the end but modelled on doesn t mean as good as by a wide margin it copies but doesn t understand what it is copying it is obviously trying for the low key suggestive lewton style but this approach doesn t follow through into the story lisa is no irene she is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her we get a glimpse of her after the first attack in asia so immediately recognise her when she turns up in new york there is never any doubt about her purpose neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake then again during her nocturnal prowling we get not one but two attempts at buses neither come off because the director doesn t understand what makes a bus work and in any case they happen to the stalker not the person being stalked these faint echoes of cat people give cult of the cobra whatever small distinction it might have but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitation plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery but i doubt if lewton or tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little time passer came out 
six gis about to be send home and discharged get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in asia surrounded by hooded figures two male dancers pretend to have a fight behind them on an altar a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake finally biting one of the dancers on the neck the imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights this is definitely a female imitation snake the cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and most definitely no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed naturally the gis take a flash photo send the cult members into an angry hysteria steal the basket containing the snake and run off with it into the asian night one of the guys the most offensive and snarky dies from a cobra bite on the neck though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room back in new york it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives still maintaining their bond with one another their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley david janssen to graduate research student richard long james dobson jack kelly and marshall thompson are also part of the neighborhood richard long has a nice blond girl friend kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer but they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy then a dark shifty looking mysterious woman faith domergue shows up and marshall thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group guess what happens first janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash then kelly gets a visit from domergue something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk long and dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows that domergue has had something to do with the deaths they also reckon that maybe she s turning into a cobra which is the case dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point by this time long and thompson are thoroughly frazzled particularly thompson who is in love with domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him too although he must explain to her what love is no matter a final reckless attack by the cobra woman against long s girl friend not one of the six original offenders and thompson must throw the snake out the window on the pavement below the body changes to that of domergue the end i think i ll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises i ll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing who paid for domergue s fare from somewhere in asia to new york who s paying her utility bills in the hotel who paid for her spectacular wardrobe how come she speaks american english so well what the hell s going on the writers and director have clearly seen some of val lewton s modest horror films and though not much effort has gone into this production they ve unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from lewton in lewton s the cat people for instance the woman is transformed into a black leopard but with one tiny exception the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it most of the transformations here use shadows too but unlike lewton s the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous lewton also made occasional use of what he called buses lewton s first bus was a literal one a potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of central park with only the sound of footsteps something or someone is following her she freezes with fright under a street lamp something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her she looks upward there is a loud wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end it s a bus using its air brakes to stop for her the producers used at least two buses in this film and they amount to nothing a guy is walking distractedly across an intersection for instance and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him there is no set up to the shot it s jammed in with a shoe horn i don t much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy ugly venomous and phallic as a matter of fact no snakes are slimy most are harmless and many are extraordinarily beautiful furthermore they re more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals you want a reptilian symbol for masculinity try a six lined racerunner it s a really fast lizard when it sees something to eat it rushes up and gobbles it down anyway if you want to see some fine low budget scary films don t bother with this one find the cat people or one of lewton s other minor masterpieces of which this is an obvious copy 
actually this is a lie shrek d was actually the first d animated movie i bought it on dvd about years ago didn t bug s life also do that i think it was at disneyworld in that tree so i m saying before they go and use that as there logo also shrek d was a motion simulator at universal studios they should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a theater and you could buy it for dvd the movie was cute at least the little flyes were i liked iq i agree with animaster they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out and back adventure i recommend it to families and kids 
as a dane i m proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years it s a terrible shame however that this surge in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism in fact it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies and as a result i have stopped watching them in theaters i know it s wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie so let me stress that villa paranoia would be a terrible film under any circumstances the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with danish film furthermore waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money erik clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in copenhagen settings i particularly enjoyed de frigjorte as an actor he is usually funny though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies namely that of a working class slob who s down on his luck partly because he s a slob but mostly because of society and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community this is problem number one in villa paranoia clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible it is much worse however that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on for instance the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near death experience of the main character with the use of low budget effects and bad camera work after that the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge this is symptomatic of the whole movie there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters and clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is telling instead of showing thus at one point you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels because the script wouldn t allow him to act out his feelings and later on voice over is abruptly introduced quite possibly as an afterthought to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director s ineptitude fortunately at this point you re roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters let alone the so called story the acting which has frequently been a problem in clausen s movies can be summed up in one sad statement s ren westerberg bentsen whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast i give this a out of rating 
as long as there s been d technology s i think there s been animation made for it i remember specifically a donald duck cartoon with chip and dale in it i don t remember the name at the moment but the plot was that donald worked at a circus was feeding an elephant peanuts and chip and dale were stealing the peanuts this was made to watch in d probably s if you happened to watch meet the robinsons in d in theaters they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it s origin there are probably somewhere around cartoons made specifically to be viewed through d glasses this claim was a bad move because it s not difficult to prove them wrong on top of that this just looks like a bad movie 
today i visited an athenean cinema with my two kids years old payed x euros about us total not to mention gas popcorn soda was asked to return my d special glasses after leaving the theater and was forced to watch what could have been a great d movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick cold war like propaganda movie like none i have seen during the last years and this is supposed to be a movie for children in heaven s name ps the average working greek makes no more than euros a month approxiamtely us ps my kids liked it but then again they are no more than babies in greek mora morons like the one who wrote the script the others who made this d disgrace happen ps d animation is fantastic but who gives a 
 nat voiced by trevor gagnon along with his brainiac friend iq voiced by philip bolden and the always hungry scooter david gore are kids with big dreams they want to be the first flies in space and what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon the apollo is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out the first thing you notice is the animation of the film i found it done very well done the scenery had depth to it as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes i didn t see the movie in d as it was broadcast on hbo however i could see that there really wasn t any scenes which took advantage of the d effects except a fight between characters near the end i also wasn t really impressed with the design of the characters to me they didn t look like anything resembling a fly especially in the coloring the flies were an unusual blue gray that was kind of distracting to me the performances from the cast was not bad but it wasn t good either there were many times i focused more on my computer than the story the writing was certainly written for a younger audience with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh i saw nothing for adults like jokes that they ll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning history was not followed in this film in fact i think it was completely ignored as the main focus was the flies i also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction and no flies were on apollo i did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though if you are an adult this is not for you it was not made for the entire family this is certainly just for kids but save this one for a rainy day 
this is not a good movie too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par the d was ok but not superb i almost fell asleep in this movie the story is about young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it the characters are lacking i truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested pixar this is not i would have liked to see more special d effects also i wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying lord of the flies pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting 
okay so someone somewhere a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a d imax movie about some flies stowing away aboard the apollo and going to the moon so they did someone somewhere was an idiot i want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware as far as i can tell the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on the graphics in general were pretty good the rocket launch gave me chills like a good rocket launch always does my popular mechanics flying car gearhead blood still runs strong and the d was pretty effective the cg wasn t pixar quality but it was generally good the flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics with some half assed late s characters thrown in for colour hippie flies african american flies with giant afros and black shades etc and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads although they made suitably gross squelching noises the scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework relying on offensive and outdated clich s s gender politics including mostly useless female characters racial stereotypes evil russians a fat fly who only wants to eat grade two level gross out humour in a movie aimed for imax they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel they didn t get their physics right zero g in the lunar module during landing burn please they couldn t even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between houston and the astronauts all of which is in the public domain instead they wrote their own dialogue which sounds like crap but we liked the maggots so they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots uh yay 
the first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in belgium are fine you see real chaos on the set a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown the cool has been director mickey rourke the bad tempered star etc you have seen everything before but it s well done but then the rest of the time the film just repeats itself the same ten minutes over and over again no climax no dramatic development no good acting not even bad acting it just goes on and on and on mickey rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f ked up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet altogether that makes good minutes 
this is a very sad movie really nothing happens in this movie the script is bad i guess they ve just copy paste the first pages to pages the producers must have thought let s create a hollywood movie here in belgium they didn t succeed now in the third week it is only running in antwerp and brussels at h or something in the past we have had really good movies in belgium like daens shades is a waste of your time maybe you could sneak in the theater after you ve seen a real movie if you ve seen minutes of shades you ve seen it all it was advertised to death on local radio and tv i hope it will disappear in the shades soon 
the first and only time i saw shades was during a sneakpreview it hadn t even been in premiere i remember there was someone of the directors staff there don t even remember who it was a belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he s stands miles ahead all the rest he plays an actor who s star has long stopped rising he s helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled shades as soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is nothing against the occasional swear word however this was way beyond annoying whenever rourke uses the f word to express something it comes naturally however when someone from the cast a non english speaker uses the f or s word it becomes arrogant and aggressive we quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre and we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from to and we were looking for the 
greg davis and bryan daly take some crazed statements by a terrorists add some commentary by a bunch of uber right reactionaries ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a moslem and presents this as the theology of islam maybe their next film will involve interviewing fred phelps and the congregation of the westboro baptist church adding commentary by some militant atheist scholars and call their film what the world needs to know about christianity ultimately this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism don t waste your time and money just turn on your am radio and listen to rush limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you ll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis 
that s pretty ridiculous i hope many people are exposed to muslims who live all over the u s u k and all over the world the religion has over a billion followers i myself born and bread in america and through my religious classes and teachings i have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society i am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world i have know many muslims from all over and i have traveled to countries like pakistan i have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media i wonder why also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion its a religion of one billion people and these are less than one percent i am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the kkk ira and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge personal or business matters through their so called religion
the documentary and we use that term loosely apparently summarizes that muslims are trying to violently take over the world then states that any muslim that doesn t admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them what the west needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets if you are looking for an actual documentary on islam and the current state of the middle east i would look elsewhere try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources 
it is not obvious from viewing this film so i recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it but this presentation on the realities of islam and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non muslims is lacking objectiveness and also completely fails to factor in the human condition it is one thing to document that the koran says many things about how a devout muslim is required to interact with non muslims but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of islam will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system there is reason to call much about the presenters into question such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism don t swallow it all hook line and sinker without some thinking of your own one specific for instance is researching the person walid shoebat who claims to be a former muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in bethlehem there are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions i am not nor have i ever been a muslim i have never read the koran i am not a christian nor a member of _any_ faith but i am an intelligent and discerning human while the film is quite disturbing in its presentation of how some muslims view their obligation to islam i remind you that there is more to islam than the views of the fundamentalists just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical christians so too there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among jews and muslims when you watch this film you need to have the salt shaker on hand one grain will not be enough you ll need more please use your own mind and think for yourself research what is presented and evaluate the state of the world and how islam fits within it based on more than what is said in minutes of video there is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together indicating a definite bias be your own brain 
you talking to me is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who i have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor he has a heavy jones for taxi driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big when he learns the hard facts of life he does what everyone else does changes his image he goes from good fella to a surf s up dude over night his friend can t believe the change but he scores with faith ford and get s a cool paying gig can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it big this is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once an interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution who knows maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this time don t waste your time with this movie unless you want to see a hot faith ford and a young bubba from forest gump xx
the dudes at mst k should see this dog of a film it s basically about a dopey hack actor in hollywood who can t land any acting gigs and he has this strange obsession with the movie taxi driver so what does this dumb actor do he dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a l a surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles you ll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie s inadvertently funny scenes like when the actor dude s girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like how could you do this to me and why is she crying cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs this movie makes no sense at all the actor who played the governor on benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog this movie will crack you up trust me you talking to me 
i tried twice to get through this film succeeding the first time and it was like pulling teeth and failing the second time despite a great dvd transfer the problem it s simply too boring if you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene which takes up most of the second half of the film you have it made but it s tough getting to that point there are some interesting talks by abraham lincoln henry fonda during the trial the ending is touching as lincoln walks off and they superimpose his memoral statue over the screen it s a nice story well acted and such but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there i suspect the real abe lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film 
when i first watched robotboy i found it fresh and interesting but then i noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is good bad episodes became predictable and main characters are not interesting again we see a hyper smart boy beaten by his older brother parents who don t understand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy also this show has no logic a super modern robot who works on two aa size batteries and can use a lot of weapons but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super activated modes we see two different robots and it declines main idea of the show robot must learn how to behave himself in human society 
anyone notice that tommy only has facial expressions the angry eyes look he gives every enemy the holding of the hands to face mouth agape and frightened eyes the smiling tommy turnbull i have to say that i pretty much hate this show i don t watch it but it s like code lyoko we ve all watched at least one i must say that this show is borderline racist uninteresting and pointless every episode ends with robotboy winning except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack the jokes are pretty crude too i think it s mostly people saying the word suck or farting i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too isn t there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate and the other uses a chain for god sake what kind of school is he going to not to mention his older brother who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities the whole show i feel is ripping off megas xlr and fosters like you could say the trio of coop jamie and kiva as well as robotboy being similar to megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he s free spirited despite being a robot there is simply no appeal to this show i m surprised that it s still running 
before i start let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing which i gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some so it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new dvd version would make a difference i have also not read the corresponding book i m only familiar with one other japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context potential minor spoilers ahead i usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories the likes of blade runner monkeys etc but i did not enjoy this movie at all while it started out mildly intriguing it became tedious by the time it was only half way finished there are all sorts of problems let s start with what is probably the most severe the dialogue the characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences if they aren t shouting each other s names for the n th time they are usually grunting monosyllables kanedaaa tetsuoooo huh grrr etc this leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two dimensional it doesn t help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals the grunting is augmented by some random pseudo philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by star trek standards there is nothing deep and meaningful here it all seems haphazard thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever what little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction not that there s anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction of course but in this case you ll find yourself asking what s the point of it all and how long until it s over character development in the last minutes or so consists of little more than tetsuo turning into pizza the hutt for no readily apparent reason the ending resembles the one in a bizarre string of images that far from resolving or explaining anything leave the viewer feeling he s just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours i m sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes some of the music was also quite interesting unfortunately it s all style and no substance tired of disney want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with adult themes i m sad to say you re more likely to find that sort of thing in south park 
this story is about the romantic triangle between a nth african male prostitute a french transsexual prostitute stephanie and a russian waiter who speaks no french and never seems to shave as a film it is dull dreary and depressing shot either on foggy overcast winter days or in badly lit interiors where everyone is bathed in a weird blue luminescence and yes i know it s because the white balance was out everyone is pale and downcast and looks haggard shabby and dirty bodies are bony and shot in such closeup that they look quite ugly and unappealing moles greasy hair yuk bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex and the story well stephanie s mother is dying all three characters go back to stephanie s home village where through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors we see a bit of stephanie s childhood as a boy called pierre the mother dies well and that s about it really character development is kept to a minimum as is the denouement of the story i suppose the storyline is not linear it would explain a lot of non sequiteurs but really after paying my seven euros i don t feel like having to construct the film myself that s what the director takes my money for to expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty so to speak is asking way too much this film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made above all from a desire to epater les bourgeois ie shock the straights i can see how it was a shoo in for the berlin film festival and i can see why it got nowhere 
if you like films that ramble with little plot exposition spiced with kinky sex this film is for you on the plus side the lead actor actress newcomer transsexual does have an interesting screen presence but not enough to add up to much more than a mildly interesting movie if that essentially this film is about social outcasts transexual prostitute male hustler and russian gay immigrant who somehow have developed a bond why is not clear we are expected to accept these misfits are at the core basic honest people who have the ability to love while they hustle their bodies on the street right and anna nicole smith was truly in love with her ninety something sugar daddy the filmmaker shows a gritty unpleasant side of life while wanting us to believe underneath it all these seriously damaged people are really quite normal to the extent they have a menage a trois which helps them through life quite a fantasy but unfortunately portrayed here as real look of life on the wild side in sum no plot no truth and no real reason to spend much time here unless of course you just like to revel in the kink 
this was a complete disappointment the acting isn t bad but the production was just so bad that at times i felt i needed to stop it but i sadly made it through and was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor movie it is o k if you are o k with cheesy moral plots and don t mind watching a movie that vastly misconstrues whitman if you want a cheesy fictional story go for it 
this isn t a movie it is a collection of unrelated ill conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim year old with a mini dv camera in fact i have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor the one with the greasy hair dead pan stare ipod and nervous tic probably shot it herself in a creative phase if you made it further than the ten minutes i did don t bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the european artiste mentality praised above this is a true and complete waste of time money and film that would have made william one shot beaudine cringe the unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanity what s next six directors shooting social intercourse at the wal mart snack counter 
when i first started watching this movie i was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train the interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring its not that i don t get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact it s just that in this film they are very boring if you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you d be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you it is realistic but you wouldn t go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie 
wow i can t believe people consider this a good movie now i have seen much worse but there are much more romantic funny comedies with john cusack this is a mediocre film at best while the acting wasn t terrible but not great for a romantic comedy there was little passion little romance there were many loose ends that don t show up or are not addressed unfortunately the main characters do come off as complete cowards they don t know themselves well enough to realize that they don t love the people they are engaged to how do we know they aren t in love by the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances i can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show the movie doesn t even end with a wedding scene more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing this movie is really about two people who can t commit to anything unlike cusack s previous characters who were more than willing to make a deep commitment loyd in say anything martin in grosse pointe blank etc the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns or anything of interest when the movie ended i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story which basically fits the whole movie boring no suspense about whether the two will end up together no joy when they do no consequences to their actions it is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie that they simply rebuke any criticism with everyone is too cynical criticism of this movie is not cynicism simply unbiased examination there are many other better romantic comedies even ones with grace kelly or eva marie saint if you think this movie is great try these movies you hearts will explode the princess bride say anything grosse pointe blank high fidelity keeping the faith charade rear window north by northwest or there s something about mary which is a good examination of idealized romance vs today s society 
this was truly dreadful it had a terrible storyline was poorly acted and was like an amateur remake of evil dead but not nearly as good it took all my tenacity to make it through this one it s a good job i didn t have to visit the toilet else i doubt i would have come back this one makes hammer house of horror look like a big screen hollywood epic the only value to this movie was the never ending supply of beautiful women not a bad one among them if you want to letch with your friends after a night on the beer then this one s for you else avoid it like the plague 
please note that i haven t seen the film since i discovered it in and my town is smaller and doesn t carry it however i really want to say something about it i m actually doing research for university on the title character richard maurice bucke and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different hollywood s ideas of people and artistic license granted the real dr bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film i think it s laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say this film has some historical basis the only actual fact i can see is the friendship between dr bucke and walt whitman please don t waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry 
the script was very weak w o enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them the script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced the story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don t have to listen to them talk this very muted stiff dialogue on a technical note the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times then again this could be called a blessing overall this same story could have better been told in a short film w a running time under minutes the obvious in your face homages to sam raimi and evil dead would have been good had they been more subtle but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off c mon this kind of mm budget and this is the best that could be done still the cinematography lighting design and shots were very well done indeed 
it s kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece i am not a dullard as far as quality films go and i will agree that from a technical filming standpoint as well as for several of the characters portrayed the film is in an award worthy class but there is no sense for me of this film actually going anywhere i mean taking the viewer anywhere it is a series of mood scenes perhaps remarkable as such but i want more from a film i look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival none of which did i find in this film yes it might be considered poetry on film but there is much poetry that i cannot live with for the same reason that it paints pictures without going anywhere one thing further to be said is that it documents a mid century english childhood which is necessarily limited in its universality i was personally appalled at what a young british boy had to live through in that time and place having grown up in america just a decade earlier i can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense i cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably in other words could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its filmic magic which i acknowledge is there and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one s actual recalled experience 
i had to watch this in school and to sum it up talentless actors talentless script and a talentless director this movie is such a waste of your time don t even watch the movie don t bother you will be so disappointed my teacher said it was supposed to be good how wrong she was she even slept through it a little the movie s actors were just bad the best actor in there was the old man and that s not saying much it s has horrible plot with awful characters so unrealistic and i can honestly said it had no point the script was unemotional and confusing there was points in the movie when i furrowed my brows and said what also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes it was just absolutely horrendous 
really started the s trend of disgusting violence masquerading as a horror film i was the target audience for this repellent piece of trash and i was disgusted then as now oh where do we start let s see the setup you can bring people back to live if they died a violent death so that laughably weak premise is the excuse to butcher people in horrible ways because well that s needed to bring them back to life this might have worked if played over the top for black laughs a la re animator or something but no it s played straight there is a whole terrified family in a wagon that gets hunted down one of the few scenes at least where their demise is off screen however just about everything else is on screen there is actually a scene where a young girl walking along is beaten and killed by zombie townspeople who are all filming it and grinning with several cameras then there is a closeup of her face as the filmmakers lovingly and time consumingly reveal in time lapse photography her beaten face being carved down to a skull and rebuilt to look normal again this done of course by a slumming jack albertson as the mortician behind it all he likes to drive around in a ambulance hearse playing old tommy dorcey tunes i guess that is supposed to be cute in the end of course even the sheriff is undead and the doctor offers kindly to fix his rotting hands not clear why the sheriff is not out with the other townspeople killing children with glee and slicing their faces off sticking needles in burn victims eyes etc i wonder really wonder what people see in a geek show like this to give it any kind of rating at all it s not scary the twists are laughable and overall it s kind of sick it s not even well enough done to see it on a dare or enjoy on a level you might watch a bad hg lewis film it s just god awful trash made for people who get off on this type of pointless gore and made by people slumming for a paycheck sad that albertson was even involved 
christopher lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as gideon this movie could have been a classic had lambert performed as well as tom hanks in forrest gump or dustin hoffman as raymond babbitt in rain man or sean penn as sam dawson in i am sam too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life the supporting performances by charlton heston carroll o connor shirley jones mike connors and shelley winters were excelent of 
the story line has been rehashed a number of times a breath of life in the retirement home several plays movies novels short stories poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end but it s still an excellent platform for character studies if gideon was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches even the subtitle and summary of gideon s simple wisdom almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors lack of focus almost irrelevant 
seriously avoid this movie at any cost i just saw it in my first sneak preview ever and although i paid non refundable money for it i walked out of the cinema after a mere minutes which already includes minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave first time ever i walked out of a movie and i lived through some pretty bad ones it s one of those films that is dubbed and badly so even though it is shown in its original language it relies on the oldest simplest and cheapest jokes in the book on the military what do we do once we reach the fighting zone you get out of the car and die actually it s much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film on drugs a guy eats some space cookies behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high all badly written and acted on women in the army why do we only get trumpets we were promised guns that s the way it is that s the way it ll stay argh okay you might actually find these genuinely funny but in that case you seriously scare me additionally i have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on european late night tv so it had lame jokes delivered badly beyond lower average acting lacked pace was badly dubbed and edited it just didn t work at least not on any level used as a measure for films i would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee germans and that s saying something if you like stereotypes which i don t it s nice to play with them though just in case somebody thinks i m not being pc enough instead of going to see this film do something useful try to teach crocheting to prawns paint your toenails in a really irritating colour disassemble your bicycle change some light bulbs try to understand einstein s theories convert to a different religion and back in fact go and listen to last christmas by wham on endless repeat anything but don t watch this awful flick 
this film makes american pie a sophisticated movie no further comment needed humor is cheap dialogues are stupid and the cast is awkward every clich is used several times without any original twist and far the worst the movie turns out to be more catholic than the pope it s so sad 
the fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in switzerland s film history makes me shake my head it s true but pitiful at the same time a flick about the swiss army could be a good deal better the story sounds interesting at the beginning antonio carrera michael koch gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church wedding his love laura moretti mia aegerter the acting in some way doesn t really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality melanie winiger plays her role as the strong michelle bluntschi mediocre personally i found her rather annoying the storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance which does not work as expected the romance part is too trashy and the comedy part is not funny at all it s just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever it s funny for preadolescent year olds but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy the humor is weak except for some shots dope cool stealing cool if you want a proper comedy about the swiss rs make sure you did not absolve your military training yet and even then don t expect too much i ll give it out of stars because marco rima is quite funny during his screen time not a hell of a lot screen time though
the youthful group in st elmo s fire who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university for the most part these kids are irresponsible selfish greedy and stupid yet co writer and director joel schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation with a now outdated cast of up and comers a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of terms of endearment and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us fire is a paltry blaze one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on from 
i think i ve seen this sort of thing before college graduates not realizing they have it pretty damn good all the while complaining that their lives suck this movie is highly derivative of the big chill and reality bites from what i can make of it they practically have the same plot if anything good came out of this snore fest it was the music that was it as far as i m concerned i m not impressed but then again i never expected anything less this movie was directed by the same person that directed batman and robin another movie that should only be viewed with a blindfold in tow now for the verdict it s a out of 
st elmo s fire has no bearing on life after university at all for the majority of us common folk anyway why was this garbage even made who can really relate to this who lives like these characters i truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script there are some talented young actors in this film that have done a good job elsewhere it must have just been one whole joke to them on set i actually found this film insulting to my intelligence the only joy i got from this is hoping that sir john hughes had a good ol laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of the breakfast club was released don t make the same mistake i did of watching this because you enjoy s films it really is that offensive to the genre 
i ll probably get a lot of flack for hating this movie guess i didn t approach it with the proper dewy eyed nostalgia of the generation before me but suffice it to say st elmo s fire was pretty crap freaking tastic even as far as brat pack films go here is yet another lovely example of the smug self indulgent neurosis that is everything s rent anyone the plot is virtually non existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best poorly delivered the rest of the time the complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesn t help the situation there really was no growth no forward movement at all even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest most predictable way possible the stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a stalker and andie macdowell is gorgeous the jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is well a jackass the gorgeous slut hides really soulful deep pain with a wild lifestyle the poet moods and mopes around for a full of the film until he can reveal he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows the virgin finally becomes a whole happy human being after getting every virgin s desire of one hot roll in the sack with a jackass before he ditches her to really change for real this time the cheating bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught and finally the feminist go around dousing holy water on any soul that utters commitment which brings me to my final beef what bond of super cement was holding these people together as friends i can t imagine being with just one of them now think of the vortex created by all that narcissism centered in one bar and they were all so terrible to each other heads in toilets near rape and sleeping around with everrrryone the cherry was after two bffs act like total baboons after screwing the feminist she s like umm actually i don t want to be with either of you anymore let s be friends and we can hang out in a totally unawkward way every day knowing that i may hook up with one or the other at any given point but neither of you are satisfying enough for commitment not that word and they all smile as if to say golly gee i never thought of that what a great idea only it s not kinda in the way that watching this movie is not 
i saw this in the theater when it came out and just yesterday i saw it again on cable this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is the whole bunch of characters are self absorbed narcisstic preeners worst of all it reinforces every negative stereotype about something dating even as it purports to celebrate people finding themselves the nice guys finish last the jerky guys make out great the jerkiest guys do best the girls are all boy toy pushovers only one character wendy is seen doing anything remotely useful to society and she dispenses with her long saved virginity in a throwaway one night stand with a scumbag in a lushly filmed scene that we re supposed to think is romantic what this really is is hollywood s concept of young america permissive detached promiscuous conceited 
heather graham couldn t play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it who do the producers of the movie think they are the absolute worst most unrealistic movie i ve seen in as long as i can remember this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign up on imdb and make sure the rating of this film drops omg i m heather graham i just kissed a drunk chick so while she s passed out i m really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself frantically what have i done jesus heather get over it and grow up and i d like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers and while i m at it instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who s mentally unstable like your so called lesbian character after all i know the first time i had gay sex when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street honestly b tch get a grip what a joke and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick but i m so sick of even thinking about it anymore bottom line if you re a smart person you ll hate this movie and if you re not a smart person then you ll love it it s as simple as that 
you ve been fouled and beaten up in submission by my harsh statements about femme fatale guns n gals movies now comes another breed in disappointing rediscoveries ninja movies many of these i ve seen before and let me tell you they aren t all that s cracked up to be they usually don t stick to the point this among all others suffers from no originality what s a ninja got to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in russia and isn t this supposed to be a martial arts movie too does plenty of gunfire sound like an incredible action movie to you is blood the number one reason to love this to death will you waste some of your hard earned cash over a lady singing in her see through tank top the answers to these important questions are found in the ninja mission which should be in the martial arts section of your video store for even more nonsense ninja fun try checking out those godfrey ho movies put out by trans world you get what you deserve and that s a promise recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts 
okay let me coin a new word here polyphobia the fear of polyamorous relationships this is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by titillating audiences about some kind of threesome only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamistic solution only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person and this director is not one of them bleh mark my words a few decades from now polyphobia is going to be just as big a faux pas as homophobia but guess who was too close minded to realize this right the first time the producers of this movie and so many like it why even make a ridiculously conservative and old fashioned type of movie like this priding itself on being limitlessly open minded about gayness it completely overlooks the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy which in turn in turning into swinging and polyamory open your eyes people please this is a disappointing run of the mill chick flick but damn i gotta say heather graham is the cutest thing alive out of 
it is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any gray matters will agree that this movie just doesn t work the problems lay in the direction cast selections and lack of depth in the character building the word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used let s look at the problems in direction script brother and sister both in their mid s seem to be well adjusted they meet a complete stranger at a park and heather graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer he then awkwardly walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him then after one date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in vegas in a week s time hello does anyone feel stupid yet he goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about words that we see on the screen and he wants to marry her not only was there no chemistry it just doesn t make sense sure it s a romantic comedy and i want to believe it could but the direction made it completely flat now heather falls head over heels with her too and when heather graham and bridget moynahan very shallow character kiss or more to the point it was sloppiest kiss ever that chemistry might be there i found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say heather cannot act i think the reality is heather was clearly the wrong person for this role this was sue kramer debut as a director and to me it was just too much for her to chew it would take a lot of craft to make this movie work and imho it could be done with better writers and casting and direction 
i had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom what really horrifies me i mean truly disturbs me is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as delightful or a must see i would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants the truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten it is decidedly unfunny poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold canned rice pudding to be kind to ms kramer the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity for having read the synopsis before i watched it i had expected something more challenging the possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister co dependence the unexpected awakening of sisterly sexuality and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry for the affections of the same girl were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from instead the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations with clich d characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction the lack of directorial control seems astounding on the one hand moynahan cavanagh and spacek all give very pedestrian performances while heather graham and molly shannon the latter in particular veer towards embarrassing over compensation at times one could lay the blame for this on the director maybe sue kramer hopes that if her actors over act they will force a bigger laugh from the audience but then again the cast is a veteran one one would expect them to do better sue kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make and for whom given the possible issues gray matters alludes to and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead i know it is never easy to make films about women and women s issues especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone but whatever direction she takes inconsequential and flimsy characters like gray are not going to cut mustard 
even years later ninja mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene fire their obnoxiously noisy sub machine guns with wild abandon and then silently leave wow how will we find those silent invisible assassins just follow the shell casings and smoke painfully bad dialog or was it brilliant and just poorly translated not an asian in sight in the cast and a whopping total of asians among the stunt crew the plot is ridiculous the acting pretty much non existent then again ninja can t act save yourselves avoid watching at all costs 
after a promising first minutes that makes you feel all warm inside you re pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy then the movie takes a turn for the worse the warm feeling might still be there but as others has said the plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it s almost unbearable to watch the movie gets sped up and you get the impression that you re either fast forwarding through it or that the producers decided to fit it in less than h m and had to cut a lot of scenes out realism isn t a goal onto itself but as a viewer i m pretty convinced that this comedy isn t intentionally unrealistic it just happens to be on the plus side this movie has a couple of nice interiors and despite the bad script i think that the actors performances are mainly good if i could rate the first minutes only i d probably give it an eight as it is now it gets a four and that s being nice if you re a sucker for romantic comedies you ll probably have a great time anyways if not i d recommend that you watch something else 
this was one of the worst movies i ve ever seen horrible acting not funny at all and well just boring i can only assume all these out of fav all time movie comments are actually the actors themselves in disguise idk what the runtime on this movie is i m sure its listed on this page it certainly felt like an eternity if your looking for a tough challenge attempt to sit through this awful movie otherwise don t waste your time as i did on this one
my family and i screened underdog the night before and as bad as underdog is my four year old loved it hot rod makes it look like oscar worthy material the only thing that could have saved this movie was if evel himself had come out of retirement to slap samberg in the face for making this movie i will admit however that the soundtrack was good i wasn t sure if the movie was set in the s but with the majority of the music coming from europe who knows if i were you i would take a pass and just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local tv station or if you are dead set on watching this people under the influence might enjoy it 
by no means is this movie as bad as perfect stranger but it just wasn t funny it couldn t stick to one type of comedy it jumped from snl to adam sandler esquire to romantic to little guy scores big to slapstick to loser the movie types of comedies although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments the fall down the hill no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way schindler s list was funnier and felt shorter you never knew if andy samberg was supposed to be in high school a college dropout or just a loser living at home with his mother sissy spacek in her worst choice of roles and poor ian mcshane the serious actor if i only had to name one is given crap to read into the camera the story drags and is completely predictable up to and including the end no spoilers here in case adam samberg s mom wants to see it don t spend any money going to see this movie and maybe lorne michaels will get the hint and start producing quality yes wayne s world and tommy boy are quality movies 
i got to see an early preview of this movie and i hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out aug rd it stars andy samberg from saturday night live as hot rod kimble he s plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father when we meet him he s jumping a mail truck on his mo ped yes a mo ped and almost makes it this would be worthy of a jackass movie if he wasn t honestly trying to do this isla fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl next door denise she seems to like rod enough to join his crew jorma taccone also snl plays his half brother kevin who documents the stunts with a camcorder sissy spacek plays rod s mom marie she remarried frank powell played by ian mcshane frank s a real tough guy who enjoys beating rod in some real drag out brawls it s clear that rod s not going to earn frank s respect till he can beat him we find out frank needs a heart transplant and rod is determined to raise the money just so he can beat his ass once he s healed and prove himself a man a long fall down a mountain side convinces rod to go big on one stunt rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life like the human torch at a children s birthday party there were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts just when all hope and money is lost along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the school buses rod wants to jump he gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle the whole town turns out and the world tunes in does he make the jump does he get the girl do they raise the k does frank get his ass beat by rod wait till this minute movie comes out on video to find out 
if i could have rated this movie by i would have i see some ppl at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year etc etc excuse me are you ppl snorting lsd or there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g i actually want my minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap i read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after minutes i totally understand that i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for times over instead of watching this movie once do not watch this movie do something else useful with your life do the dishes walk the dog hell anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod 
this movie is one of the worst comedy movies i have ever seen i hate these napoleon dynamite rip offs just face it people the dumb humor has been mastered already make something new for once all these new comedies are just horrible and coming out of snl andy samberg is not ready for a lead role yet i hope he can bounce back from this awful movie and will arnetts character is just plain bad hey will did you read the script the plot is truly the worst ever written now you tell me if this is weird this is the movie rod kimble s step dad frank is dying and the family needs to pay for the heart surgery so rod is planning this huge jump to raise money for frank only so that rod can beat frank in a fight and prove his manliness yes thats the movie you tell me would u spend to see that piece of crap just horrible adam
so i had low expectations for this movie to start with but it failed to meet even those while there were some funny parts even one or two laugh out loud parts this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly leaving us sitting there going wtf just happened in addition there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning also the editing was really lacking there were some poor scene transitions but that seems to be the style nowadays it made me laugh but i wouldn t watch it again and i m very glad i waited for it to rent give it a chance you might enjoy it but don t think you are in for anything along the lines of the year old virgin or superbad 
first off to give you some idea of my taste in movies comedies i enjoyed superbad knocked up hot fuzz blades of glory comedies i hated evan almighty the brothers solomon good luck chuck i should have followed my first instinct and turned off hot rod after i got to about the minute mark i knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once the script is absolutely brutal i have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack on imdb any one older than years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defective this doesn t come close to anything with will farrell and it s clear that andy samberg can t carry anything longer than a to minute sketch on youtube or snl i don t know how they roped ian mcshane and isla fisher into doing this movie they must have owed favors or something i came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie but i thought it would at least be funny i didn t so much as smirk i don t normally comment on movies at imdb but this was so awful i just had to warn people this is only the th movie i ve seen that i ve felt compelled to rate 
this is one of those movies which makes you think would hulk the real american hogan have done the same frankly i don t think so and he d have been right i m italian i cannot go proud of my country for many reasons but i wouldn t have rowed for another team the french for example simply because i m in love with juliette binoche besides the protagonist doesn t fall in love desire with a british girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman so why rowing against yale as far as acting is concerned well all the players act very poorly and then you know i hated that dead poets society atmosphere in fact that s another movie i hate 
not much to say beyond the summary save that this is an example of j edgar s hoover s constant attention to maintaining a good pr profile they don t make movies this bad very often especially with the likes of jimmy stewart and vera miles in the blend too bad 
fairly amusing piece that tries to show how smart orcas are but in the meanwhile and quite oblivious to them makes the audience feel stupid by making the most ridiculous film richard harris plays quint i m sorry that s wrong he plays captain nolan a fisherman who catches sharks for a living but is lured by the big catch and tries to catch a killer whale when the capture of a female killer whale goes awry don t ask it s mate don t ask goes on a rampage don t ask and starts stalking captain nolan don t ask soon captain nolan realizes that they have something in common don t ask pretty amazing film making here folks i got to tell you though the beginning with the whale noises and nothing much else is pretty haunting and the end credits with the most godawful song is pretty entertaining 
this is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic genre defining masterpiece jaws yes brainiac great whites and other species of shark bull black tip oceanic white tip tiger have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found humans don t often make it onto that menu granted but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior it s not like it s never happened the odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town singling out a human nemesis sinking several dozen thick hulled north atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people all friends of the aforementioned nemesis are close enough to the water for it to reach are so slim as to be laughable much like this turd of a jaws knock off laughable great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards as they look like seals from below a shark the size of bruce if you don t know look it up would be more than capable of sinking a boat like the orca hey that s the name of the blatant rip off we re discussing as it would weigh upwards of lbs i could go on but i don t need to jaws is amazing better acting better effects better music better writing orca is crap blatant rip off of jaws lousy writing abominable effects most ridiculous plot this side of an olson twins flick it doesn t take a masters from columbia university to see that watch better movies 
this film can t make up its mind whether its message is humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless or don t ever go in the water again a fisherman nolan is out to nab a killer whale a very bad thing but when he accidentally accidentally mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate the cow and i use the word in all senses who is obviously a sick psycho bitch and the canonical villain of the piece throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself i doubt it was her first when her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self inflicted wounds her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to nolan obviously as among humans total psychos date other total psychos the film reeks of half thought out anti human message the poor poor whale the evil men must suffer and die and yet it does not succeed in demonizing nolan at all it s true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and as the film progresses he grows more and more compassionate to the whale s pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel a little better the films final journey in which nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north reminds me of melville s eerie man whale connection and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion where these two husbands might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident it s clear nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss however it never goes there the whale character has no compassion or respect for anyone the final scene loses this focus and becomes jaws like where the sea monster finally kills everybody and nolan and no doubt through an oversight fails to chomp up the whale hugger tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier i love animals and i detest whaling and what is more i love orca whales but if this film s goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed nolan shows compassion and growth and feels for others and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming the only message one can walk away with is if you see an orca whale ever anywhere run the other way cause if you step on his fin the wrong way he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you 
many have stated that orca killer whale is a jaws rip off this is not really true though the enormous commercial success of jaws undoubtedly made these man vs beast stories more attractive propositions for film makers in the second half of the s orca killer whale would be better described as a modern day retread of moby dick it s a story about obsession on one hand a whale s obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate on the other a bounty hunter s obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives sadly orca killer whale emerges a very disappointing film its fundamentally interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plotting shark hunter nolan richard harris encounters a marine life researcher rachel bedford charlotte rampling diving off the atlantic coast of canada their meeting almost ends in disaster when rachel s team are attacked by a great white shark but a killer whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark after this nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a killer whale and selling it to an aquarium but his plans backfire when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the distraught male looks on rachel tells nolan that a killer whale is an incredibly intelligent mammal with a strong memory and feelings just like a human worse still native umilak will sampson warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge nolan initially tries to forget about the whole regrettable incident but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it eventually nolan is forced to pursue the killer whale the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice floes of the arctic ocean where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each other two things stand out in this film one is the haunting score by ennio morricone perhaps the greatest composer of film music of all time his talents wasted on various tenth rate clunkers during the s and s the other is the amazing widescreen photography of ted moore which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye in every other department orca killer whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew harris appears extremely ill throughout the film his hair bedraggled black rings around his eyes and skin deathly pale his performance lacks the usual vitality rampling strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her long winded and ill informed explanations about the ways of whales the rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles the most memorable of which sees bo derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale the plot is total nonsense from start to finish with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that engulfs and destroys the local refinery although it s credible to suppose that whales are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human adversary and carry it out so calculatedly is utterly absurd orca killer whale is really one for completists of the man vs beast cycle from the late s most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair 
orca starts as crusty irish sea captain nolan richard harris his crew are trying to capture a great white shark so they can sell it for big bucks unfortunately when a hapless marine biologist called ken robert carradine comes under attack from it the shark is killed by a killer whale this raises nolan s interest in killer whales decides he want s to catch one of them instead however while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess enrages her mate nolan orders the whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens the male killer whale is annoyed to say the least kills one of nolan s crew before they reach the dry land of newfoundland in canada once there the killer whale conducts a series of attacks on the town it s people in an effort to lure nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death directed by michael anderson i thought this blatant rip off was terrible i m sorry but i thought it was just plain ridiculous utterly dull even at a modest odd minutes the script by producer luciano vincenzoni sergio donati is so stupid i m lost for words the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesn t help if i have to listen to charlotte rampling go on about how intelligent killer whale s are just one more time i ll scream i m sorry but i simply don t believe a killer whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to sink it i don t believe a killer whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there i don t believe a killer whale can identify someone s house know someone is in there then wreck it on purpose i don t believe a killer whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat i don t believe killer whales can physically recognise people i don t believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out maybe i m being a bit harsh i mean it s only a film after all but it s a film which is trying to be serious things just got so ridiculous that i was half expecting the killer whale to write a letter to nolan to tell him his plan hand or should that be fin deliver it the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else they should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold seriously that s a statement that s no more far fetched than anything else in this film i found the film very boring totally dull had awful character s with no on screen presence at all it goes without saying this is a jaws rip off which doesn t even come close to spielberg s classic director anderson is no spielberg that s for sure this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense scares tension or atmosphere at all all the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater totally forgettable there s no build up to them virtually no pay off either as orca doesn t get to eat a single person then there s the scenes which literally had me laughing the shots of the killer whale appearing to cry are pure comedy the opening scenes of the two killer whales i suspect tried to show them as a loving caring couple but i couldn t help but think that this is the closest we ll ever get to killer whale porn hilarious stuff the footage of the killer whales themselves is bland boring instead of footage which matches enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else do you get the impression that i don t like this film good forget about any gore or decent deaths either there s a brief scene when bo derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you ll miss it this probably had quite a big budget it still sucks there s nothing outstanding about orca it s well made i suppose but flat bland totally forgettable the cinematography is quite nice though the acting is bad rampling is awful the late harris irish accent is embarrassing orca is a lame jaws rip off which completely ignores or messes up everything that made spielberg s film so good this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as jaws the revenge 
everything about this film was terrible to start with this film had a pretty good cast and i find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever the sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy it had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite irritating please please please please please do not inflict yourself with this disaster you will only be hurt
a movie that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword i ve seen schlock in my time but after viewing the wretched mess i don t think i can ever watch a another movie again may god pity the souls who made this premise ex army quiet stud underwear model type character well acted actually goes looking for the girl who sent him a xmas card while serving in the military lands in with her cabin living granola type family who are right wing loggers family takes to him and it takes hours of our time for the chick to see he s a better catch than her liberal looking french wine drinking porsche driving loud cell phone talking lazy city slicking jewish looking fianc the bad d characters d themes being beat over the head with the pro military theme ed asner the good commercial breaks were long peter jason it ended 
i watched this film on the hallmark channel recently in my opinion the film started out decent enough but eventually got sour the story a u s soldier in afghanistan receives one of the christmas cards that a woman back in the u s has sent out to troops for christmas he becomes so inspired by the christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life a motivation to continue on when he is given leave he goes to the very town that the woman lives in he comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the christmas card he meets the family and after saving her dad a vietnam war veteran from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street the family decides to take him in for a while we learn that he doesn t have a family back home the soldier agrees to help out the family during the christmas season by working with them at their logging company the family comes to love him and vice versa the soldier also becomes in love with the family s daughter the woman that sent the christmas card there s only one problem she already has a serious relationship with a man that she s in love with it s also a long distance relationship the boyfriend is very different from the soldier he prefers wine and trips to france over hard labor and the great outdoors the woman prefers the latter throughout the rest of the film there is a love triangle as the woman s boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what s best for her daughter spoiler alert the woman comes to like the soldier more and more as they have a lot in common they happen to spend a lot of time together she gradually becomes attracted to his persona then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back now she s so confused she s in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday but she s become so fond of the soldier soon enough the boyfriend who doesn t know about the kiss but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her decides to propose to the woman and she accepts his plans for their marriage however are not plans that she wants she wants to be at home have kids and be close to her family he wants to travel the world go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along this doesn t sound too thrilling for the woman however the soldier feels bad about what he s done and doesn t want to make things worse so he decides to leave town despite the dad s urging him to stay and be with his daughter it all comes to a head when at the christmas eve service with church we find out that the soldier hasn t left yet the boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he broken hearted basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her the film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together things i like i like the soldier throughout much of the film he s basically nice and polite with a strong sense of doing good for others there are moments in which the family is going with church and participating in charitable causes the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table the dad and mom have a long lasting and evidently healthy marriage the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong things i don t like there is a very typical love triangle story in this film the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend most of the family practically applauds this behavior the family goes with church and participates in services yet this is how they act there is some bad language conclusion i became disappointed as the film ran on and it got worse and worse i ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because i had enough so the film started out decent with some few gem moments but ended up ruining itself therefore i don t recommend this film to anyone 
sorry my fellow nevada city neighbors but this one is bad brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside she was stiff throughout the movie i looked up both alice and brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work i would have guessed that they were first year students ed asner and peter jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line ed certainly has not lost his charisma i wish i d taken the time to meet him while he was here i love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because i ve been there i make nevada city my home and was anxiously awaiting the premiere i was sadly disappointed sorry 
i m stunned that the reviewers imdb gave this tv film as a high a rating as they did it s an innocuous sweet uncomplicated clich of a film that had two big names from the past in it both of whom did a decent job but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels i like a good romance as well as anyone but as my wife and i were watching this and before we saw the rating we said there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there s nothing in it to challenge their brains their faith their comfort level or their cultural preferences it s possible to make a good film like that and away from her is an example but this was amateur hour there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one truly another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films watch the family stone it s miles ahead of this schlock 
this film deserves another bad review consider one reviewer extolling the film s virtues that include no sex violence or gore uh excuse me the very set up of the film has us watching as cody s young comrade with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving cody holding his lifeless bloody body and given the nature of war we know that cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis so much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines cody s persona is erased from viewer memory sans any family of his own cody like john rambo roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown usa in the guise of some place called nevada city no mention no realization of the clear fact that cody is damaged goods we know this since his co practically declares him so as he order cody to get some rest away from the death and destruction of war this explains as none seem to notice or care cody s obvious flat effect it is not bad acting it is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder not guessing here remember his co ordered him off the battle field how about that accidental kiss as noted by another review the fall was an accident the kiss was not how exactly was cody respecting faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for now that was a non family value moment a moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on youtube of course faith s lapse of fidelity as well as cody s coming on to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the xmas season all cheering their cheaten hearts and lips we know little about faith s fianc except that she professes her love for him she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal could have waited if any second thoughts he is generous he loves her to death the family has nothing really against him he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans no evil doers here asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like we love you son you are part of our family literally days after they have met a stranger named cody and the band of brothers speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field bottom line this film is cotton candy xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways most grossly when it applauds cody s disrespect for faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for by re defining family as we know it to wit accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all love you how many of you have done that or know anyone who has done that not 
i was fully amped up to see this film i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand i shouldn t have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt clark s worst film there is so much wrong with this film first off some of the acting is great in particular nick stahl as the bully and the girl with the curly brown hair i can t recall her name but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable especially leo fitzpatrick he s a veteran of clark s films now and he was so brilliant in kids but in bully he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually the screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student no sorry a high school student one who has never seen a movie before and i couldn t fathom clark s intentions was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids existence it sure as hell didn t stop him getting in a damn good perv i m no prude but i didn t need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every minutes i still maintain that clark s best film is another day in paradise it s fantastic and i don t think he ll ever top it 
is it just me or is that kid really annoying hideos sister spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so as for him well i know he s a kid n all but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree so far i m only half way through and am fascinated by the story but the people in it let it down i just hope it gets better by the end as i can t not know what it s all about although some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook indicate everything is backwards i e dog is god live is evil etc just seems a little obvious at the moment yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning as yet anyway if my opinion changes at the end of the movie i ll update this post but if your reading this then well see above statement 
forbidden siren is based upon the siren playstation so many s game like most video game turned movies i would say the majority don t translate into a different medium really well and that goes for this one too painfully there s a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer leo morimoto and his children daughter yuki yui ichikawa and son hideo jun nishiyama come to move into the villagers don t look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the siren on the island to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing naturally and slowly things start to go bump and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants but in truth you will not bother with what s going on as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill placed out of the norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity until it s explained much later it s one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered despite it clocking in under minutes i think it s a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to things begin to pick up toward the last minutes but it s a classic case of too little too late what saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience it turned out rather satisfactorily but leaves a bad aftertaste as you ll feel cheated somewhat there are two ways a twist will make you feel it either elevates the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling unfortunately forbidden siren belonged more to the latter the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but i will be that explicit it s still not worth the time so better to avoid this 
because some people like me like to know everything about a movie even if they plan to see it including the ending anyway here s the ending as i remember it because i couldn t have been more than yrs old when i saw it for the first and only time on tv but i ll tell ya it sure scared the little kid that i was and i thought about it for days afterward and it still stands out in my mind to this day even though some of the details are a little vague abe vigoda was in this movie i don t remember that i didn t even remember that ol barnabus was in this movie and i loved dark shadows so at the end the lead character belinda montgomery is lured by the judge joseph cotton i m guessing even though i remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge see how memory fades to the wedding place which as i remember it is in a cavern of some kind maybe i ve got that wrong and shelley winters is there laughing and the judge has a cape on and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him and he throws back the cloak and he has goat legs and he announces he s actually her father the devil and she s played right into their the satanic cult s hands because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with i guess that s robert foxworth turns out also to be the guy satan wants to marry her off to the demon with yellow eyes and yep sure enough they show robert foxworth and his eyes glow yellow there are a lot of close ups in the last few minutes of the film everyone is laughing and rejoicing except for belinda montgomery who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something and that s the end the bad guys win 
the best laurel and hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps accidents and destruction mostly caused by stan but with ollie receiving the bulk of the punishment see the great the music box or towed in a hole as some some classic examples here however for some reason is it because it was based on a sketch by stan s father the boys play it straight in a comedy built around jokes and supposedly funny situations it doesn t come off it s merely another third rate tedious s comedy heightened only by the personalities of stan and ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures ollie s finger wiggling stan s blank stares etc or comic abilities the film begins with them running from the police since we never see or know why it s hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught and thus hiding in colonel buckshot s mansion the premise for the humor ollie passing himself off as the colonel and stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging they are not playing stan and ollie in this film their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny but he doesn t get the chance to do any of that here he s constrained by uttering too much dialog to move the plot but none of it rises much above the silly we are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing lord plumtree s name the call me a cab okay you re a cab joke cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns and a non sequiter ending of stan and ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two and james finlayson is still doing his silent era full body takes and keystone kop jumping jacks stan and ollie do much better in a situation comedy in sons of the desert where we get to see them do what we love about them be themselves in fact seem to be their best years since this film does not play to any of their strengths why bother with it i have to give it a 
it s hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts but i know that humor is very subjective i have seen all of their sound shorts by far the best of their stuff imo and i found this one of their weaker efforts in the year this was made stan and babe made shorts and one feature they were extremely popular and their boss hal roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly in addition this was a time of experimentation for the writers and stan i would say this was an experiment that really did not work as someone else said it does not play to their strengths too much dialog and plot the best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with stan as agnes the maid and the great thelma todd talking about girl stuff if you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out blotto or brats from the same year they made so many shorts in such a short time that i think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts they made something like films altogether very few except for the ones made at fox were outright failures but there are some county hospital me and my pal the live ghost the fixer uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones but other then those i find something wonderful in just about all their shorts quite a record in my book if you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out but i would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to stan and babe 
pedantic overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the federal bureau of investigations begins quite promisingly with a still relevant probe into an airplane explosion however the melodrama involving james stewart and wife vera miles just gets in the way miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule esteemed director mervyn leroy helmed this adaptation of don whitehead s book but despite the talent involved the picture fails to make much of an impression best performance is turned in by murray hamilton as stewart s partner however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is from 
how can a major german tv station broadcast a mess like this it s amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent even the well known gottfried john is acting very poor especially in the double murder scene how amateurish the screen plan is very very extended perhaps to fill out parts of the movie be careful not to fall asleep while watching the set is obviously very often a blue screen f g the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background in the german version the sound and the dubbing is very poor probably reason different languages of actors but other international productions do handle this much more professional advice do not watch it s a diabolic waste of time 
st rtebeker is truly one of the worst tv mini series ever made on this planet the acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense just two examples visby was shown as a village of three houses instead it was a major city at this time it s best days already passed by secondly hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the baltic sea hamburg had no access to the baltic sea the major town at that time was l beck but worse than all that the directing how can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this impossible there was not a single believable scene it the fights were ridiculous and i could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes i can t understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent 
this was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting mainly from the supporting characters the interview with hugh laurie on the dvd was actually more rewarding than the film itself hugh laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool the movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment if you have never seen rio or the inside of a british bank this film is for you out of 
this warning against anti semitism is well meant and may have had its purpose at the time but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film the director has no idea about mise en scene the cast varies from bad till even worse the great austrian comic hans moser is wasted in his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy that is designed as a set from das kabinett des dr caligari one wonders whether the makers had all their mental capabilities the restored copy i saw dutch filmmuseum gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place but may be the original editing was bad as well 
gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story it s too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash pakistan the movie s aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that pakistan and it s government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws won t work and all the songs and music of the movie are all bad most likely the sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguided the movie sucks and sucks with power i think only amisha patel was good in the movie if i can give out of i would but the lowest is please save hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie disaster 
this move is slow plodding cold dark and without a plot or hope it follows that tried and true european formula that they love to subsidize that is never seen but that the critics think makes an important point the movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between americans and europeans regarding employment in this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel it s the government s duty to provide them with work whereas in the u s we know we have to go out there and create value for someone spain never looked so backward 
a romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class artist with a comfortable upbringing it is clear that the writer director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it if you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers have no anger no fear no frustration etc all the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks boyish jokes they do never look for work the do almost never experience rejection or anguish etc living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school ridiculous specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of ken loach etc 
this movie is painfully slow and has no plot it conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers one of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job there may be some social commentary here but it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light i do not understand why it had a when i decided to watch it i watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff no luck the imdb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes anything above was worth watching and my wife says javier barem does not even look good in this movie he s not my type so my agreement does not mean much sigh i give it a 
quentin crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully one is a romantic when things are show unbearably grim they are realistic and when something gets the ironic treatment they re spot on unfortunately for leon de aranoa he falls into the second catagory this director has obviously tried too hard to make a spanish ken loach type movie without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that elevate loach movies from merely being depressing los lunes al sol is just that only depressing things are unrealistically grim the characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point and if the glum story isn t enough aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette the films was ridiculously over rated at the goyas a movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society in this case unemployed harbour workers does not automatically make for a good movie even though i would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people this movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate in st century spain unemployed people do not live like beggars and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms and it s hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it leon de aranoa obviously doesn t have a clue about working class spain and does it no favours pretentious is the only conclusion i can draw the scene where the men watch a football match for free has been directly copied from a film which deals much more realistically with the subject of the poverty trap namely purely belter which is afar more engaging humorous and yet sad 
aka mondays in the sun i have no idea what i just watched three men wander aimlessly and drink grousing about everything and at everyone in their path this is supposed to be a drama but what it is is a total waste of film without a single redeeming quality i have read reviews touting the performances herein as wonderful beautiful and heroic i m afraid i cannot agree unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto humans who ever walked all in all this was not a movie it wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience i ve watched this three times and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage there is nothing profound here whatsoever it s crap it rates a zero from the fiend 
this film story is bad enough which can happen in real life i m very can not understand when they show us this bad film i say it was bad because there is some reason if madonna was rich and can do everything she want then why she falling in love with that bad man how can the story script is so weak she was so rich can do everything she want but not dare to divorce her husband that is very impossible the words i love you it doesn t meant anything in this film 
whatever possessed guy ritchie to remake wertmuller s film is incomprehensible this new film is a mess there was one other person in the audience when i saw it and she left about an hour into it i hope she demanded a refund the only reason i stayed through to the end was because i ve never walked out of a movie but i sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that madonna and ritchie could actually think they made a good film the dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery ritchie took lina s movie and turned it into another blue lagoon this is a film that you wouldn t even waste time watching late night on cinemax time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this 
i had the mis fortune to see this film at a showing in the us having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing i am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on imdb the original film was a turkey but an interesting one it fitted into that early seventies post revolution thing this film just stinks of well nothing really it s that bad imagine a badly done perfume commercial see what i mean madonna never could act and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years she looks worse and worse with every one of those years increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat guy ritchie who has built his reputation on lock stock could never direct either his movies are shallow badly cut fashion shows he doesn t disappoint here either he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle please people take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below they are quite obviously business plants don t encourage ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money 
 warning spoilers contained herein this is a semi autobiographical look at what might happen to madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island there s absolutely no challenge to madonna in this role and it shows she s just madonna playing madonna and she can t even get that right i know what you re saying you re saying how do you know this is what madonna is really like you ve never met her correct i haven t but we all remember truth or dare don t we i know kevin costner does you would think in the year that madonna might have learned something one way or the other from the crossover ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen for goodness sake hasn t madonna seen glitter mariah carey showed the film world how it is done mariah kicks madonna s trashy butt to the curb in beauty talent screen presence charisma characterization you name it all we see from this glimpse into madonna s world is she s the only one in it if there s one thing to be said for madonna it is that she s consistent when she was an mtv darling she set the world of women s fashion back years now in film she has set women s roles in film and society back years by glamourizing all the most hated horrible reprehensible odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really don t possess here s the spoilers don t read any further if you don t want to know here s the one good thing i will say about this film and i really was impressed by it they didn t go for the hollywood ending madonna s character lives in the typical happy hollywood ending madonna s character would have died on the island and her long suffering oppressed whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good decent woman a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife and they both live happily ever after but in this extremely depressing conclusion she is rescued and once more this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife and his life will once again become a living hell here endeth the spoilers 
no doubt when madonna and guy ritchie married it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers if you ve been through the ordeal of watching swept away then you know at that level it was a match made in hell after nearly years of trying to become a respected actress or octress as she might have pronounced it in the next best thing she still can t get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent and that s the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience if there s any justice in this universe she just blew her last chance 
and forget this completely if you really need to see madonna act rent body of evidence at least willem defoe is in that one in this film while the sets are beautiful you may want to mute the dialog you won t miss anything bruce greenwood is wasted jeanne tripplehorn is a prop and madonna is so awful it becomes amusing why they had to butcher the original film into this mess i will never know guess they thought it was bankable madonna as an actress certainly is not if you rent the original film from though you will enjoy it and the actors in it can actually act 
for years madonna has tried to prove not only herself but the public eye that she can act unfortunately trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona doesn t mix well she seems to fare better when she s not the star of any movie if you watch her in supporting performances in desperately seeking susan or a league of their own she actually comes off looking good since the story revolves on other actors the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default the trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie regardless the genre being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way whether it be good mediocre or plain awful she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance this is the crucial difference between madonna and let s say bette davis or meryl streep the latter two even if the movie were to fail because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it or because the script fell short or because the actress per se was just not at her moment there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb both davis and streep have had their share bette having a longer career than streep in such fare as bunny o hare and wicked stepmother streep in she devil but at least there s been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance madonna on the other hand not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself fares much worse and even in the hands of someone as woody allen in shadows and fog an inferior classic she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff maybe even nervous as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just couldn t let go so here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two character movie guy ritchie more known for action movies filled in masculine energy seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of michaelangelo antonioni or ingmar bergman who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease and at minutes the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn it doesn t feel sincere from being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love this has to be the most unconvincing degree turn since fay dunaway s laura suddenly discovered her passion for tommy lee jones in the eyes of laura mars equally unconvincing is adriano giannini s nasty turn around the middle of the movie it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic and when he gives in to madonna s love it s too quick to be believed filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery doesn t enhance or add upon this transformation from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well it only makes it drag bog it down and when madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight close up it feels she s trying too hard many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late s early s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion could the movie have been better of course there are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again it s been done before in overboard for example it could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change to ensure a moral tone much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more silent film look as in persona it could have even been something of a thriller providing that the giannini character have a mean streak as billy zane had in dead calm even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for madonna as the over the top uber control freak getting her comeuppance but with its mean streaked humor without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom and without really defining giannini s own character this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the sexes 
this movie was extremely depressing the characters were so cold the mother who is he main character is everything but motherly ok she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first her husband dies she then goes to visit her son and meets this hunk who is sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him until this part the movie is all right not excellent but it can be watched the guy is charming and who can blame her ok it s not very motherly to sleep with your daughter s lover but let s blame that on the shock of losing her husband she becomes totally obsessed with the guy i think this is the part where i started to dislike the movie she s always there wanting to please him in an old fashioned way with snacks while he is working on her son s house i guess this is the only thing she ever learned to do as if it was the only way she could get his attention the guy obviously is not very interested actually it seems more like he considered sleeping with her a charitable activity and instead of being insulted by that she continues to beg him to go to go to bed with her and to be nice to her when he becomes very abusive i want to please you she tells him in a desperate way while he is insulting her very badly what outraged me in this movie is the utter lack of self respect the mother has for herself she tells craig something like i am just a shapeless lump the first time they sleep together this movie is an insult to women kind if it had been me i would have bought myself a little object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and a lot less emotional pain 
this movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever it really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made but if you can stand the mind numbing plot character development and direction you may get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so appalling that it is funny the movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of consolation because their career was probably ruined because of involvement in this movie if you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already i feel your pain then these words have come too late for anyone else stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste hours of your life then at least you can clean up or something while viewing it 
 igor and the lunatics is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy hippie cult killing spree horror movie apparently even nearly twenty years later charles manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash filmmakers this is a typical troma production meaning in other words there s a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot there s a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display which isn t bad but it s all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at igor and the lunatics is so desperate that it s even using a lot of the footage twice like the circle saw killing for example the incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug addicted and charlie manson wannabe paul one of paul s lower ranked disciples named igor becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy igor is he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch hiker girl there s an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo artistic camera tricks like slow motion footage and lurid dream sequences maybe there s one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete for no particular reason the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds 
whoever wrote the nice post about this must have been a friend of these guys this is bad even for backyard wrestling in fact this isn t even backyard wrestling really it s a few guys hitting each other on a trampoline each guys is about lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this it is just a few bored kids that even give yard tards a bad name if that is possible if you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling pick up backyard wrestling a pleasure for pain it stars the biggest names in byw mdogg and josh prohibition these guys are good they have actually went since yarding it and gotten professionally trained as real pro wrestlers they went legit and have gotten better i recommend checking out those guys mdogg is insane and off the hook so don t waste your time or your cash on this crappy dvd there are better back yard videos out there 
yeah unfortunately i came across the dvd of this and found that it was incredibly awful first of all the characters suck i mean come on if some dork in an orange hat who calls himself orange sherbert is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character then they should definitely not be in the film making scene poor costumes bad interviews and basically there is not one wrestler on this whole disc with any shred of charisma the wrestling in splatter rampage wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline they make sure to giggle together all the while too making the experience seem more like a toddler s playtime than a wrestling deathmatch basically splatter rampage wrestling is a pretty lackluster backyard wrestling clone only instead of blood weapons mayhem and wrestling we get a trampoline giggling kids terrible audio and some guy called orange sherbert wrestling fan or not avoid this dvd it s awful 
i understand what this movie was trying to portray how the old are often ignored and treated like a bother which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty i do not have a problem with this message but i just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to watch i enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self consciously arty as in this case the result is often frustrating including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience the female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together this is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its merits but i was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else it might have a deeper message than other roger michell movies for example notting hill but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching 
i rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it even though we had heard from a mutual friend how great it was now i am pretty conservative in my views but i knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it i figured before the movie started michael douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist but i thought thats where the political statement would begin and end ok the plot was solid single president falls for a lobbyist ok this has potential i thought to be pretty entertaining since the plot was unique but then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial the movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the president and sydney annette bening there were several ridiculous premises in this movie the character sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a closer could she have been more flighty she was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything hardly a closer i am an sales and she could not close selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst secondly is there anything more ridiculous than richard dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic this is the most liberal man in hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue give me a break i liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible the speech at the end was simply ludicrous the line about i am a proud card carrying member of the aclu was a joke first no president would ever admit something like that being an active member of an ultra fringe group second why even bring something like that up you just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative i thought the plot was great and unique i thought michael douglas was a good choice as president but the movie went from being a movie to a left wing political statement which is why the movie failed its a shame to see a great plot ruined by hollywood having to force their political views on the audience
if derivative and predictable rape revenge thrillers are your thing then you re in for a rare treat they don t really appeal to me so i couldn t find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale it seems like something straight out of the s a different age when this would have gone straight to video gillian anderson and danny dyer do ok work with a weak script and a tedious scenario but what is gillian anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as lady deadlock in the bbc tv adaptation of bleak house last year the director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near rape and by his work on documentaries but even that s not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up dyer i don t think i was the only person in the cinema laughing what i can t understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film filmfour and verve pictures both have been involved in some great independent british films in recent years verve distributed bullet boy code and red road straightheads doesn t deserve to be mentioned in the same breath filmfour and verve take note is this really the best you can do what are independent british filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement it s a big blot on both of your reputations listen carefully can you hear the thousands of fans of independent british films crying in despair 
disappointing and irritating the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clich s in a disjointed fashion character is not explored in depth these are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element the mother s affair with her daughter s lover anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye the script portrays darren daniel craig as a dr jekyll mr hyde without any hints about why except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic 
this reminded me soo much of michael winner s crappy dirty weekend with it s awful english low budget feel firstly i must say i am a fan of both exploitation and serious film i appreciate say demented for it s ineptitude and last house on the left for it s sheer unashamed brutality and any number of inventive and increasingly brutal italian spin offs this was just pointless though kind of like a british budget director thought let s remake i spit on your grave without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with hostel the whole thing just doesn t hang together or have a point what s with the rapists s daughter why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras crappy 
this movie is the worst i ve seen in the last years it is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash the film is rape beating and revenge genre couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes he didn t go to their car instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which betray her and she has been gang raped then somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him so stupid scenario bellow hollywood he was against that revenge but she is raped they laugh to her so she must kill them all but once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing rifle s top in bad guys anus and went away while he has gone crazy and execute bad guy personally i think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gang rape and beating which is not big surprise because sponsor obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money lol this movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they won t see anything they are looking for this director should be banned it is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by british cinematography which i personally like and that is the reason i ve watched this don t do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film 
although i use this site quite frequently to see how other people rated what i think are challenging or just plain enjoyable films after watching this movie on film four last night i felt compelled to write something down even if it just helps cleanse me once again the film was possibly the shallowest experience i ve ever had the main characters played by danny dyer you sure and gillian anderson who will always be scully as leonard nimoy will always be spock had no real substance about them i m not sure if the first half hour of the film didn t make the final cut but surely in a revenge movie you would like some empathy with the victims here i couldn t care less in fact the only character i did seem to care about was the dog with the stag coming a close second and both animals out acted dire sic and scully who were quite frankly terrible i guess though you re only as good as the script you are given and i d like to warmly thank the writers the producers the director and all of the cast for wasting minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity 
may anne reid and toots peter vaughan are paying an apparently infrequent visit to their son bobby steven mackintosh and his family in london even as the visit begins toots suffers a fatal heart attack leaving may adrift unsure and questioning her life and future finding herself attracted to her daughter s boyfriend darren daniel craig her actions lead to inevitable consequences beautifully filmed but for all its heralded realism and acclaim the mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant even repellent characters and asks the viewer to engage with them reid shines as may and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that salvages the film from a completely depressing mire but michell and kureishi have allowed craig mackintosh and cathryn bradshaw to create such utterly obnoxious characters that it becomes increasingly difficult to care what happens to may as written the characters played by mackintosh and bradshaw are in fact so utterly selfish and cold hearted that one begins to wonder what exactly was kureishi trying to say as directed they are either unwilling or unable to lift bobby and paula above the two dimensional in their ghastly selfishness worth seeing for reid s performance but little else a crying shame 
i wondered why i didn t like peggy sue got married more than i did when it first came out in with all the hype somehow i found nic cage s character off putting way off putting then the plot didn t seem to make sense then by the end of the credits the question came to mind what point was this movie making what was it saying the answer unfortunately was not much if anything i really don t think this movie aimed at making a statement unless it was your life is your life you re gonna make the same mistakes no matter what so keep your eye upon the doughnut and not the hole not a very profound statement and i m sorry not profoundly made in this movie the writing simply isn t that good the direction is uneven and is strangely overblown at times kathleen turner was the best and in my opinion only worthwhile thing in this movie and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre unexplained circumstances with a script that had no apparent statement to make she also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason i didn t enjoy this movie more she states in her autobiography that cage made a point of fighting his uncle coppola s direction every step of the way doing it his own way not a good idea for a new actor and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid his voice was annoying abrasive and unnatural and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy i understand what he was attempting to do play a young guy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is setting up his own karma for future failure but he goes overboard the way he does it is abrasive not effective and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the man we would have had a more enjoyable film cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person and those scenes are more watchable than others but if i had to watch the movie through in its entirety i would find myself wanting to pay someone in l a to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected put on scenes the movie doesn t aim for a statement doesn t make a point is great to look at except when cage is doing a demented elvis impression but without the voice and is ultimately confusing and a waste of time given all this kathleen turner surely deserved an oscar in this flailing mess of a movie i can t recommend anyone spending two hours watching this unless you like turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes believe me you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes and it will make just as much sense kathleen turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her cage comments which proves that she s strong enough to be honest and to hell with other people s comments you go turner i m not particularly a fan of this actress any more than i am of any other first rate actor or actress but her candor is refreshing cage s acting can be good to annoying and here it doesn t work at least in this film now we know why 
did francis ford coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing apocalypse now that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie you have to wonder what the director of the godfather and the conversation was thinking when he made this flabby film it gives kathleen turner a starring vehicle playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to redo her adolescence knowing all of the things that life as an adult has taught her and turner the trooper that she is does what she can with it but this movie couldn t be saved by anyone it doesn t even have any style to it and given its director one would expect that even if it had nothing else it would have that grade c 
a great slasher movie too bad it was the producers and not part of the script basic plot summary man with redhead fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of freakish coma and proceeds in offing them to various degrees of success only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as i did and chopped the heck out of the movie nothing flows you get lost on which redhead he is with at the time didn t he off that one earlier and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and resumed filming when he awoke not that i can blame him i passed out times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist warning when you see the ending do not try to connect it with anything that happens before you will just get an aneurysm not worth the time effort or god forbid money only reason to get a instead of a the slim chance that the hacking occurred between film release and the horrible version that i watched 
oh those italians assuming that movies about aristocrats with weird fetishes castles drowned in gothic atmosphere and back stabbing relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance are inherently interesting to all if you ve seen one film of this type you ve basically seen them all the mst k favorite screaming skull fits the mold too and the night evelyn came out of the grave is formulaic by the numbers and dull as hell even the luscious erika blanc is put to waste here zero 
 soiler it s fake the whole thing is a fake there is no ghosts or zombies alan is a lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself so he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala scooby doo to drive alan to commit suicide most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them he s not even killing them he drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace if he looked at the so called ghost of evelyn he could tell she was wearing gloves my god what a waste of time don t bother watching it renting and if you bought it and haven t watched it yet sell it quickly do yourself a favor and stay away from the night evelyn came out of the grave i give this stinker the crap o lantern 
exceptionally horrible tale that i can barely put into words the best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end alive and well only to be massacred again there is the chance that i missed some crucial plot elements since i may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on the box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film i was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a euro trash sexy horror flick i get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out all the good stuff more than likely i got the pg addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new planet of the apes movie watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff you ll need it 
never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just dire i stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made snoop pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor choice maybe this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a film i found it unbelievable lacking atmosphere and i found many of the scenes hideously stilted a musical maestro he may be but a serious actor snoop ain t the acting by dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was passable but not enough to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue perhaps i have just entirely missed the point but to me it didn t fit into any genre it didn t elicit any empathy with the characters nor did it create any suspense in fact i found myself praying for the end and quelling a deep desire to slap all three of the main characters

perhaps i couldn t find the dvd menu selection for plot on off clearly the default is off when the end credits began to roll i couldn t believe that was it like our poor but beautiful protagonist i felt used dirty cheap the characters were drawn in very broad strokes and the writer s disdain for wealthy thatcherites was all to apparent i consider myself a roosevelt democrat but would appreciate a bit more subtlety of course the problem could be with me i see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture alas not i the only thing that kept me from giving this a was the nice scenery human and plant 
i decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the bbc in the weeks prior to it starting i watched it despite the fact that i don t like the pretentious kind of stuff that alan hollinghurst writes sorry to his fans but i think we have a case of the emperor s new clothes with this author s work i admit that the acting is excellent it is beautifully shot and i was reasonably entertained by it however i found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production the explicit gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on tv several times so it was nothing very shocking i m afraid full marks for production values but low ones for storyline content i m afraid 
this british pot boiler has one thing going for it the young men are uniformly good looking the older men are opinionated right wing thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the reagan thatcher years young or old however morals in this three part mini series are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of oxford it is not pivotal to the story but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier nick comes to london with a friend whose father gerald is a rich conservative politician and babysits his sister cat while the family frolics in the south of france they neglect to inform him that when upset cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen implements nick mistakes their self serving gratitude for affection and moves in finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him inexplicably nick lives in this house for four years but as the plot depends on this point it s best not to question it while nick is most pleasing to look at he is unbearably obsequious his coy subjection to rich bigots soon had me climbing the walls deeply closeted except to cat she guesses his big secret on sight he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay though it hardly seems possible nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he supercilious tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film so imagine the venom which spews forth when nick s sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid gerald in true tory fashion has become involved in several personal and financial scandals so the revelations about nick add to his embarrassment this gives gerald one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy except for one brief moment of indignation nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement denial self loathing naivet or ignorance you decide if you can manage to sit through this whole thing without throwing something at the set 
even if you subscribe to the knee jerk anti free trade politics of this movie it is still just the same tired note played again and again and again clink clink clink even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair who advocates a return to first principles the reverend billy is pretty hard to look at as a serious figure the clownish reverend is the sort who wakes every morning with no aspiration more ethereal than to see his own face on tv before he climbs back into bed that night he has a pretty wife i have to admit but it would take tons more than that to save this dreary mess of a movie the interminable bus rides are the worst part with progress shown can you guess by a colored line moving across a map aww you guessed oh well it has the virtue of being short is that the only favorable thing i can say hmmmm yep afraid so 
watching the tenants has been a interesting experience for me it is the first film i have ever seen where i have shuttled at speed through parts of the non action and i can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to serbo croat indie and find them fascinating the tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over orchestrated one of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue apart from the set pieces where characters collide in a very structured setting to make this work the film needed to feel more conceptual which it didn t this leads to a lack of realistic character development everyone seems two dimensional the worse for this is the character of bill spear aka snoop dogg i found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic at one point i even stopped the film because i got so annoyed by the character s aggressive violent and monotonal delivery the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary on switch which gets really predictable after a while and i so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities however one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film supposedly s it feels and looks more early noughties if it had been more securely fixed in the s his character might have seemed more understandable the lighting of the film was also awkward all the way through the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty jazz infused atmosphere that just did not come off largely because the set was too well lit the tenants to me is an unbelievable film it doesn t depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race identity or the life of a writer be they white or black strangely i came away with the feeling that this project needed david lynch his eerie clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable 
the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it keeping his great days tv series in mind but also counting in his mtv production i bet you will that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production supersize me i did not had my hopes up high sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less as with supersize me after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end 
this film is just another distortion among many distortions on the so called sins of consumerism please note that reverend billy an actor bill talen is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the sins of consumerism we might want to ask are questions like what does reverend billy do for a living how does he make his money does he make his living off his tax deductible organization how does the internal revenue justify this as a tax deductible church or organization everyone knows that christmas is commercialized but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families friends or extended families everyone is not charitable everyone does not spend time with their families friends or extended families but holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity yes america does have more than its share of problems but with perseverance americans have and always make it through great difficulties and even in times of strife america has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world that happens when americans pull together and unite rather than to separate and divide yes there are problems with corporations and monopolies but it will take americans to bring back the small businesses along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities yes globalization has brought us its share of problems but it will take americans to bring production back to america americans and the u s government need to learn how to stay on a budget no matter how large or small it may be and we must stop our dependence on credit our over reliance on credit will make and keep us poor from the cradle to the grave it is important to buy but if we buy less we will rely less on credit and if we are able to save even a small amount of money we will have money for a rainy day not to say that as americans we will gain an equal share of wealth wealth is not guaranteed and has never been guaranteed but stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of americans hold most of america s wealth there is a good proximity that you or i can reach the level of the upper middle class and who knows what can happen from there be positive work hard and at the very least you and i will be able to reach at least some if not all of our dreams in life nothing is guaranteed but we always have that something to reach for and if you or i don t have dreams we might as well be dead in america there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams as individuals we are a part of the pack but we always can become the leader of the pack it has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions but i pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs values and perspectives but as far as the distortions expressed within this film i do not have any faith in such beliefs values and perspectives i rank this film with a out of but in all honesty and truth this film deserves a zero this film has no integrity and i cannot recommend it 
slow boring extremely repetitive no wonder the weinstein company did not buy this this spurlock should eat more mcdonalds while filming himself and quit producing there is no way you can watch this and enjoy the preacher is a joke the whole idea is not funny you can make a minute film with this idea not a feature i am so sorry i rented this movie i will never watch anything with the name spurlock on it it is completely garbage filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal the film states that the american consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy 
goodnight mister tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of world war ii soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from london and when shy little william is billeted with reluctant gruff old tom who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold our tale begins and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is in fact it s just the old odd couple buddy formula aren t any new stories being written as i suggested there s hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around and certainly no hint of the horror of the blitz as london s citizens file politely into air raid shelters even when the local schoolteacher s husband is declared missing presumed killed he is later restored to life i found `goodnight mister tom cliched and obvious and john thaw s accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin accent incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellow imdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of one 
perhaps the biggest waste of production time money and the space on the video store shelf if someone suggests you see this movie run screaming in the other direction unless of course you re into self abuse 
i ended up watching the tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on snoop dogg s appearance a passionate fetish of theirs on the cover understandably i did not expect much i thought the movie would include the typical array of snoop dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in clich rap videos however my generalization was for the most part wrong unfortunately this didn t make the movie any better most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama whereas i would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick the film tells a story of two struggling writers dylan mcdermott and snoop dogg who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship this friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller coaster most of which is contributed by snoop s character reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder and although the movie is a drama the acting which has a morbid and serious tone from snoop and company was more comical than anything else i wouldn t recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that there are some mediocre conflicts but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue the end however jumped at me with a sudden surprise it was a little bit twisted somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end while watching the ending credits i couldn t help but picture the director thinking oh god how the hell do i end this snoozer by the way the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax all of which are more visible than waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters 
i am glad to see most other people here don t think much of this movie either it has some big names in the cast but that s it there is nothing else to recommend save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films the story involves nothing but unlikable self centered chain smoking hip characters that national film critics all seem to like and most of the public can t stand the oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable the southern racist stereotypes are right from liberal hollywood and the story is depressing 
this movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so none of them generate any interest or positive response i waited for the intrigue to begin hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end but there was no reward for doing that if you want a synopsis look elsewhere to me the action isn t worth recounting not that the story was that bad i guess you could say i had some problems with the script i e i thought it stunk a look at the credits will show you that there s a pretty strong cast here used to no avail most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs of the actors i hadn t seen much of before i especially liked deborah kara unger that s about all that i can find good to say about this picture 
this one is just like the th movie the movie is really bad it offers nothing in the death department the one liners are bad and are something that shouldn t be in a noes movie freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie lisa wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while the characters are extremely underdeveloped all in all better than the th one but still one the worst movies of the series my rating 
tenants two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house they at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build this is based upon a bernard malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel very little of the dialog is natural its purple and brimming with shades of meaning its as if a college english major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script it s awful and i found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom snoop dog on down are fine form unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise i can t really recommend this movie while not really bad its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away i lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end if you re interested i d try it on cable but i wouldn t lay out good money to see it 
it s getting worse the series is on a serious down fall the first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really really terrible movies robert englund gives another great performance as freddy but the rest of the cast can t act the story is alice having survived the previous installment of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alice s unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son check out the first three miss the next three then watch the last one 
this film is so incredibly bad that i almost felt sick watching it up until this point the other installments had at least one good thing about it part was suspenseful and gory part was off beat and entertaining part was interesting with great effects part had great music good special effects and a new entertaining freddy krueger part is more boring than anything i ve ever seen before alice a much prettier blond from part is back with her boyfriend dan at parts this supposed elm street installment turns into a daytime soap the newer characters seem harsh and even that sweet alice has a chip on her shoulder freddy seems to be completely out of this one he looks tired and doesn t seem to be as gruesome his one liners seem out of place and different where as in part they could be pretty funny leslie bohem s story never gets off the ground and stephen hopkins direction is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good the whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic it s also confusing and pretty stupid avoid part at all costs 
i am still trying to determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one or vice versa being that it is nearly fifteen years since i saw this film the fact that i remember so little about it does not bode well perhaps it is simply because i only watched it once or twice but i doubt it if there was anything worth remembering about this film you can rest assured i would remember it at the time this film was released the franchise was still entering its dying phase so a lot of media coverage was allotted to it it s never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations of the plot basics one such article had to explain that freddy was left too weak to infest the dreams of grown humans so he decides to go after alice s unborn son so far so good but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience it should not be left to some unrelated publication making use of the trivia given in part three about freddy s conception one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out of the horror for infants category but alas that was not to be it goes to show the sheer idiocy of the american ratings system that a piece of b harni esque garbage like this could get the same rating as a genuinely frightening piece like the original by this time the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it lisa wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent acting or perhaps she just looks competent by comparison to the rest of the cast either way given that her last role was in something called the all new adventures of chastity blade i doubt she really had anything else going for her even poor old robert englund has been in better productions than that in the past fifteen years given that box office returns were in a steady decline and not just for this franchise at the time one would have thought that the studios would realize neutering their films does not make them more saleable in fact this particular film like its immediate predecessor was so neutered that not only did it fail to attract a new audience both succeeded in alienating the core audience that originally supported the franchise despite this part five must be given some credit for not having the bright luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at i gave a nightmare on elm street part five a one out of ten by trying to appeal to everyone or the mpaa s idea of everyone it succeeds in appealing to noone like parts two and four one could erase it from the continuity entirely and nobody would notice the difference 
like freddy s revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn t go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it basically alice from number is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy i ve not alot to say about this it s moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series 
star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning alice having defeated freddy at the end of the last film is now trying to re adjust her life but her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence freddy trying to come out into their world again it s interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing freddy films charles russell eraser the mask renny harlin the long kiss goodnight cutthroat island cliffhanger die hard and here stephen hopkins lost in space predator but while russell and harlin made a good job of it hopkins imo has made something of a podge with this entry that should be quickly forgotten the story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here with freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby even at about an hour and a half it all gets rather tiresome and of course not scary at all the bon appetit bitch catch phrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry 
some movies are repellent but still fascinating pulp fiction others are simply boring this movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly repellent and totally boring by the end i didn t care about any of the characters i just wanted all of them dead so i could get out of the theatre 
at first look of the plot tagline i figured it could have been a decent film could i have ever been more wrong the beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film for the first minutes you don t notice the cheesy acting horrible sound and god awful special effects but then it gets worse just about minutes into it i was asking myself what was the plot again i could only ask that question when i wasn t busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film the main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in between the flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off morpheus from the matrix although he is doing just a horrible job the actor s talking about star wars and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable now at the end of the movie you don t realize that it s the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing the morpheus character dies the only good thing about the movie he utters a couple words and the credits roll what is this no plot bad acting cheesy everything it couldn t get any worse please if you value human decency do not watch this movie 
i am not from america and i know what wife swap is when a show came out of that name i was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sexual moments from the program but what i got was a real sucking stupidity i was misjudged by its title name it has no adult contents no nudity not even vulgar dialogues broad casted threw hallmark channel and i think they edited mute out such contents to make it neat a show which gives a picture of current american western family state overweight chubby peoples polluted teenagers and their sucking family goings in each episode two wives two mothers more correctly were chosen to live in each others home and re changes each others family routine with their new own rule sometimes its turns out to be good or more evenly bad on the ending section each mothers are brought back with their husband and try to conclude what they did to each families past days it s the sucking portion of the program were each contenders fights for their rights i was sucked to see all of these instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff i mean who make this program more than that who gave the name wife swap its better to be called as mother swap all in all it corrupts all the great things the real wife swap stands for wife swap average sucking reality show 
this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is i think a story of a rebellious college basketball player his tough but fair coach his girlfriend and a fellow student played by michael margotta who has continual nervous breakdowns the story goes nowhere there is zero character development there is nobody to care about and the performances with the exception of bruce dern as the coach are terrible it is hard to believe how a talent like jack nicholson could direct such an awful movie make sure to avoid this turkey 
detective tony rome frank sinatra returns to the screen after his self titled debut this time it s a film that s played for erm laughs while on a diving trip rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea her feet as you might expect encased in cement rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain waldo gronsky rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone the portly sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy raquel welch but he fails miserably in this ham fisted vanity project the frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding every woman in the film is a dither head who likes bending over is front of the camera director douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles there s even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief this was a film made by real men for real men to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality it s a shameful shambles 
though not a fan of sam rockwell i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the opening of joshua heck i wasn t even aware he was in joshua until i started the movie so it goes without saying i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie not the leads a sort of rosemary s baby the omen or any other demonic kid movie joshua was billed unfortunately it fell flat slow incredibly slow and flat yet i continued on to see how this would all resolve hoping beyond belief the ending climax would shed some light on the subject okay i admit it did a wee bit but what a stale closing and what a low low budget movie or at least that s how they designed it a person falls you don t see the drop you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood a person gets hit by a cab you don t see it you see someone complaining holding a bike up i m not sure if this is called style or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects we have a rich family with a crazy mom a workaholic father attempting to balance everything a kid joshua who may may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot she cries as much as we see how many days she s alive and what was that about are there rats above or is it joshua is his mother nuts is joshua crazy is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family is he going to grow up to be michael myers or does he drive his family to the brink i don t think so they were nuts prior and no so called acting could make me believe otherwise unfortunately barely any questions were answered barely any open doors shut i m sure that might have been the idea but for pete s sake give me something anything there are plenty better kid gone wild movies to explore joshua s more like the mini me of the antichrist 
i did not enjoy the film joshua at all perhaps it is because i saw another much better similar film titled orphan days prior but perhaps it s really just because this film was not very good i am going with the ladder sure the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn t mean the film could not succeed it could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building boring uneventful and really didn t leave me thinking anything more than that wasn t very good when it was all over at the end joshua s motivations are revealed i won t give that away but the reality is that he didn t really accomplish his goals since despite vera farmiga as his mother abby disappearing about th through the movie all arrows point to her returning home soon she was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then joshua s father her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically so shouldn t she be coming home soon won t joshua have failed won t his mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his father soon i question the father since his future is left open ended at the end of the day i didn t care about the characters the evil demon child joshua wasn t really scary the storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring suspense fell flat every single time when it was over i couldn t believe i had sat through the whole thing just because the acting was good from the parents especially vera farmiga as the mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil child go see orphan now that s a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie 
the acting in the film is really well done honestly but the movie is so slow and so boring as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt i am glad to see sam rockwell in this he did a great job so did the other actors as i mentioned but man this is one of the worst dragged out films i have ever seen now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good but other than that avoid it this film has so much filler it makes a twinkie cake jealous i never ever walk out on films but watching this one at home with family i walked out yeah it was that boring apparently my comment doesn t have enough lines to post so here s some more filler i guess i was inspired by the movie i just watched 
i watched the whole movie waiting and waiting for something to actually happen maybe it s my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology is it a weird re telling of the oedipal myth i want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him i didn t understand why certain plot elements were even present why was the construction upstairs why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so why have the scenes at all with the father at work why have such a nice kitchen if you re only going to eat takeout why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around i see lots of good reviews for this movie has my taste been corrupted by going up with s b movies and old sci fi flicks 
as a member of the cast i was a member of the band at all the basketball games i would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in oregon this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of oregon where it was shot seems that the u of o sign was shown while we were shooting we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff mr nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill mannered men i have ever met quite a time for a young year old but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late s and early s despite what hollywood may think trombone player from oregon
i gave this more than a because i did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and i the acting and the dialogue were mediocre and i must confess i came out feeling like i had been beaten over the head with the god this god that and christ is our saviour stuff the movie and the story line did not need it if as i am you are a recovering catholic or christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous the movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been

except for the brady variety hour this was some of the hokiest television i ve seen in a while the video production qualities weren t too bad but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early s and marie osmond looks like she did battle with the avon lady and lost big time way too much eyeliner it was kind of embarrassing to watch veterans danny kaye and eric severeid take part in this even more interesting was watching alex haley talk about the african pavillion in world showcase that would be opening in about a year as of this writing it is years later and it hasn t opened yet unless you count disney s animal kingdom all in all though for all the shortcomings this still an interesting visual piece of disney history 
this may be the worst show i ve ever seen aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about hitler it just isn t funny or entertaining in any way it is very similar to a s sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations but while it can be well done like in i love lucy it s just not funny here i think the show was based around the novelty look it s hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure but it just fell flat in every regard the guy playing hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone i wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air i thought america had some tasteless show but the brits had us beat this time america would never air a sitcom about hitler although we did have that show about lincoln s slave the secret diary of desmond pfeiffer chances are you ll probably never see this show since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on dvd 
i wonder who was responsible for this mess the jokes wouldn t have worked for gilligan s island if this had gone to series would there have been jokes about auschwitz or would eva have to replace her oven only to have adolf suggest the kind that seats another post compared this show to i love lucy the problem with this is that lucille ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situations and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence after the damage the nazi s did to england and the number of people they killed i would think the very concept of a comedy about hitler would seem repugnant and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced 
 spoilers khamosh is totally unrealistic lacks a plot and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves the most suspenseful scene in the movie was when shabana azmi is in the shower and then we see her tv playing the shower scene from psycho this movie actually expected users to believe that naseeruddin shah s character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many spoiler begins at the end the killer spills his guts to shabana azmi long enough to allow naseeruddin shah s character to run up and shoot him spoiler ends it is a little humorous only a little in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing shabana azmi exclaim oh sh t overall a baaaaaaaaaaad movie rating out of out of 
today i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation changed everything it changed our perception of security it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity most importantly and devastatingly it changed our world however i can t not stress how utterly repulsed disillusioned and angry i am at the careless blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word of mouth among moviegoers and critics alike most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press hollywood has sunk to a new low even lower than the low down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty behind it all is uwe boll i am very angry at this movie how dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post world how dare they to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength remember think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks ask yourself if you have a soul think remember respect the memories of the lives lost on by not seeing this film at all 
i saw this movie at the edmonton international film festival with the great dr uwe boll in attendance the film is simply put very very bad and no not in the usual uwe boll so bad it s actually entertaining way but just plain bad the plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life because of a past criminal record apparently can t get a job and with an awful pound cheating wife this man turns to his cult leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus al qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence the acting is awful except for dave foley who really tries despite it all the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion and people taking a poo it s supposed to be satire but i m not sure of what think airplane but done by the creators of south park and without any jokes 
i m not going to waste my time writing an essay and waste your time i would like to say however that all those who are uptight about this movie even being made are being totally ridiculous johnnymacbest you can t play that card and i mean the nationalism patriotic card to make people not watch this movie this is a movie that expresses its free will in this country oh yea i played that card even though the director is german and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he reaches for a camera but the world is full of controversy and its the same thing you ve heard before like the gta controversy it s a comedy laugh and be disgusted not disgusted all together its dark humor and obviously you don t have the heart to take it the past is past yes people remember those who were lost but its time to move on that was years ago you can still watch this movie and have good moral values besides i m insane and who needs a soul 
uwe boll has done the impossible create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content so as an adaptation it s a success unfortunately it s still uwe boll we are dealing with here so don t expect the movie to be actually any good while it does have it s moment postal wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through at its core postal is a satire on the united states as done by a twelve year old kid boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier this results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck high points include the director satirizing himself and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles low points include well pretty much everything else after the initial surprise wears off postal simply becomes a bore to watch yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity this probably would have worked as a short movie but it s just not enough content for something that lasts over minutes although it feels twice as long there are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 
although i am generally a proponent of the well made film i do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries and more often than not i do enjoy and admire films that successfully break the rules and it is quite true that director pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema but it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point pasolini s work is visually jarring but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography this is true of decameron pasolini often preferred to use non actors and while many directors have done so with remarkable result under pasolini s direction his non actors tend to remain non actors this is also true of decameron pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock offend or otherwise disconcert the audience such elements can often be used with startling effect but in pasolini s hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film this is also true of decameron i have been given to understand there are many people who like even admire pasolini s films even so i have never actually met any of them and i have never been able to read anything about pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me judging him from his works alone i am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not break the rules so much by choice as by lack of skill and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for existential boldness thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker i find his work tedious unimpressive and pretentious and this too is true of decameron it is also sadly true of virtually every pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure 
though the title may suggest examples of the commandments it is a definitely incorrect assumption this is an adaptation of seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni bocaccio s th century decameron story collection set within a medieval italian town s largely peasant population it is a diatribe on the reality of sex and its consequences within that world and time a realistic view of life within this world it sometimes feels like a journey back in time given the depicted human element of its time one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists as well as the ironies of life at times or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic church s rules nothing terribly special but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions 
alright if you want to go see this movie just give me our money i ll kick you were it counts and you ll have the same amount of fun i ll even guarantee more fun this movie once again shows what happens when you can t get any one else to hire your family and your forced to make your own movies same i m going through puberty humor jokes just dumber and grosser this movie is really a disgrace to movie goers they try to shock you into laughing because you can t believe the levels they have to stoop to make you laugh so my offer above stands as
i don t know where to begin so i ll begin with a snippet from the back of the cover of this movie alive combines the tension of vincenzo natali s cube with kitamura s own versus i have not seen versus so i can t comment on that but i think cube was an excellent movie which i recommend to everyone however in this case someone has clearly confused tension with boredom i ll just go ahead and spoil the entire plot because besides being one holy swiss cheese of a plot it s also moldy cheese and the movie is not worth spending any time on even if you don t know the plot beforehand so it doesn t matter if i have misunderstood the plot don t hit me it s probably because i had to struggle to keep my eyelids open so the american military in nevada once lost a ufo i the nambi desert this apparently makes sense because they re both deserts so surely they re practically the same place different continents or not a monkey broke into the ufo and acquired an alien something which was passed on to a japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert what ever the alien thing is now passed on to anyone who s bloodthirsty enough to kill the current host the japanese military wants to use it for military stuff so they decide to make it pass from the current host the researcher s daughter to some other dude but instead of just picking someone out of the military which is full of people who are bloodthirsty and already on the military s side they decide that it s probably a good idea to pick some criminal out of death row instead oh and the reason they pick this particular criminal from death row is because he was the first person in history to not die from the non lethal electric shock which is the standard execution method because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they get electrocuted i don t know if they do this so they can giggle in the staff room at how everyone dies even though it s not deadly or if they just want to cut down the electricity bill then the movie turns into what the matrix would have been if it had been really lame and superfluous fighting bores us to tears for what feels like an hour and oh wait now they remember that they already had a dude who was infected with the alien thing so the entire movie up to this point was actually a totally waste of time and also human lives then everyone dies the end the only one moment in the movie where i didn t want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich instead was when a dude was pinned to a wall by a pipe through his chest and he s hanging around up there and another dude walks by the dude hanging on the wall says i m in pain shoot me and the living dude looks at him and it s not like he s a mean dude or anything so he really looks sorrowful and doesn t want the guy on the wall to suffer so he shoots him rhetorical pause in the stomach gee thanks a freakin heap 
given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness minutes including end credits so roughly minutes of actual film but what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed the gags are quick and sometimes not even funny the only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the nike basketball spots james woods portrayal of max van sydow s character in the exorcist and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film very unfunny was the take off of charlie s angels which like the first scary movie and the matrix spin off scene basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it today s youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the s such as the exorcist and maybe of the s poltergeist et al hopefully scary movie will take some time to put together making the spoofs more enjoyable one thing though the film features more than the last one of promising young actress anna faris whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel just for her casting and acting ability i give this movie a out of 
the script for scary movie just wasn t ready to go this is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident to the actors and the audience alike director keenan ivory wayans and many of the actors are funny people and so the movie isn t completely humorless to their credit the film has several funny moments but as a whole scary movie is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original the first scary movie was a laugh a minute film it turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold the humor in scary movie is as heavy handed as it is un original they even miss obvious opportunities for parody two of the movies stars are former cast members of beverly hills and this was a show that was begging to be parodied in the final analysis scary movie is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon the script needed a lot more time to age stars out of 
i know a few things that are worst a few it had a couple of funny scenes it is a movie not appropriate for kids but only a child would find this movie hilarious this is definetly a movie that you would like to use a free rental coupon for don t waste your money just to laugh a couple of times 
i was very disappointed by this movie i thought that scary movie although not a great movie was very good and funny scary movie on the other hand was boring not funny and at times plain stupid the exorcist amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie james woods was great now i ll admit that i am at a disadvantage since i have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first where i had basically seen them all but bad comedy is still bad comedy something that really hurt this movie was the timing which ruined some of what might have been good jokes scenes and jokes drag out way to long also the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again for example the talking bird ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time but it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying the routine between the wheelchair guy and hanson chris elliott was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless some jokes even got repeated from the first movie for example the creaming i guess you would call it of cindy anna faris was funny in scary movie because cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he creamed her but this time around it was out of place and not funny the bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around the scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film tori spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie but i did enjoy shorty marlon wayans who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film the scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film don t get me wrong i love the wayans family and their humor that is why this film is so disappointing they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes 
scary movie is definitely the worst of the films for there is not much of a plot bad acting pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes but and this is a big but there is one good actor one good recurring joke and a good beginning the good actor being tim curry the one good recurring joke is the creepy weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things and the good beginning is the spoof of the excorsist the plot to scary movie is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion but will they survive the night this film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it 
i ll keep this short as i know i don t need to say much alive is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some but i found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning the film did very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so convoluted that i completely lost interest as i said i know others enjoyed it but i found kitamura s alive to be anything but a lame extremely boring drama disguised as a thought provoking action sci fi flick i felt like i was suckered into watching this film based by its intriguing premise and uber exciting cover art my suggestion pass it up for kitamura s far more enjoyable freshman effort versus or his riot godzilla final wars and don t get me wrong i m always up for a good thinking man s film but this certainly wasn t it there was nary a moment that i actually cared about a single event taking place in this overly preachy dialogue heavy movie if you wanna talk about something talk about boring 
keenan ivory wayans is probably one of the worst directors i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie scary movie was ok too but everything else keenan has made are real disasters avoid such titles like don t be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood i know what a title obviously this film too just anything that has keenans name in the credits it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh just trust me on this maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films j d seaton
i don t often go out of my way to write comments but for this i had to just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy this doesn t come close while the premise change in colour gender whatever is bad enough and has been done better many times before the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen it would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks however the wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women as you will have guessed by now they fail completely i have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make up people that hollywood can provide its appalling add to the mix a basketball player built like a building terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low and i like bad movies avoid like the plague 
white chicks hold on why couldn t they have dressed as black chicks oh yeah they wouldn t look different at all can anyone give me one wayans movie where they haven t dressed up as ladies don t be a menace doesn t count jack white and michael costanza ghost wrote that the other norton trio members acted as directors in white chicks there s never really any jokes it s just the wayans acting like girls for hours there s no setups no punchlines and no laughs there is a lot of i think i m gonna play some time crisis at least for me there was times to be exact somebody has to tell kenan ivory damon marlon shawn damien the only talented one kim rakeesha george w and osama bin wayans to stop making movies its only hurting the o zone layer verdict out of 
i enjoyed the movie very much emotionally intellectually and visually it contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects and doesn t need them one bit holding my attention the entire time with the visuals story and interspersed words of wisdom however [ ] some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear understand [ ] there is unnecessary overuse of swearing especially the f word which is the only reason this movie was rated r [ ] the movie is balanced with humor and emotion but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film except the final resolution last minutes is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long [ ] i will not recommend this movie because of seconds of background narration which did not add one bit to the side character it applied to or the film it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward the main character s mother of german ancestry when watching old wwii movies secretly roots for the germans there would be no local color or art if the nazi s won the war i don t know of any germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the nazi s won wwii 
as gently as i can i sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time i did not find it the warm emotionally satisfying film others did i found it boring with music that distracted from the film the story was thin the characters overdrawn and the direction pedestrian fooey now i m going to write some more about this movie so i make the line minimum there really isn t more to be said and brevity is important but imdb has its minimums so here goes young eager kid finds nascent talent seeks time with aging embittered mentor in spite of father s cartoonish homophobia aging embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little conflict arises while i don t think this is a spoiler i ve added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much mostly i just found the film boring and pretentious a waste of my time i honestly don t understand what little fuss there seems to be mostly on this web site about the transcendent quality of this movie i think it s really worth avoiding but as dennis miller used to say maybe i m wrong 
i enjoy a good slow moving drama christmas in august chungking express virgin stripped bare by her bachelors the way home springtime in a small town hana bi eat drink man woman dolls in the mood for love and spring summer fall winter spring are all enjoyable films just to name a few unfortunately there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves these are what i call ian films incomprehensible artistic nonsense tsai ming liang is the king of this subgenre and vive l amour is his masterpiece in fact this is the cr me de la cr me of crap infested garbage under the guise of art people walk around in their apartments drink water stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant hang posters staple papers together go to the bathroom eat do pushups have sex slap at mosquitoes etc i m not joking when i say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless art house trash there is no plot no storyline no interesting or noteworthy events no emotion no meaningful dialogue and most importantly no drama the most eventful scene has two people banging on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress ironic that it s also totally tasteless and gratuitous the relationship of the characters on the bed is practically non existent tsai apparently didn t feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to bang the person under the bed is just as one dimensional and uninteresting he likes to drink water makeout with melons and stroke himself this is tsai s idea of character development a truly misguided entertainer indeed tsai s true contribution in vive l amour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in art house film history he first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for consecutive seconds only to then show her cry hysterically for absolutely no reason whatsoever for another consecutive seconds the film then abruptly ends no point no entertainment just pure concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer in an effort to beat a dead horse the underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom in fact kiyoshi kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film kairo and guess what it s actually interesting that film moved as slow as molasses in january but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as vive l amour kairo is a perfect example of that fans of cinema may thank tsai ming liang for directing this film as he has provided irrefutable evidence that art house cinema can be just as poorly made as b grade made for television horror flicks art house snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of self righteousness the quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like army of darkness and gasp showgirls how do you like them apples 
need i say its a stinker i gave it a rating of only watch it if you suffer from insomnia there s plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up but not much else happens in this movie there is no suspense no deep shocking secrets revealed no real threat to the heroine s well being a few disagreements slight raising of voices that s pretty much it the secrets are nothing that couldn t happen to anybody the last secret revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point the plot such as it is revolves around a young woman named faith meg tilly who is an artist who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very very wealthy older widowed woman and a growing mother daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her it turns out the older woman s daughter cassandra is dead you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two why he s still hanging around years after cassandra s death is a good question there s also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant a faithful butler who seems to do everything cooking cleaning serving the meal answering the door etc everything except apparently locking the door since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith is there s nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms and leaning forward on the edge of your seat because there is no mounting tension in this film just bland pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time 
three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt jane stanton hitchcock s novel for the tube yet this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and just doesn t know when to quit struggling artist meg tilly suddenly finds herself employed by wealthy enigmatic ellen burstyn who desires a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom after learning about the last gathering held there ellen s daughter s coming out party tilly decides on her artistic theme never dreaming the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began nor that she and the deceased bore a striking resemblance to one another two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn which doesn t bear close scrutiny one that fails to match either lady in emotional intensity burstyn s role teeters on camp while tilly gets stuck doing the dreamy eyed waif routine only one sequence late in the film the morning after the mural is finished is charged with honest feeling anger and betrayal the rest is piffle 
 st watched out of dir ewald andre dupont fairly lame account of the titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much heralded event the replication of the disaster is not bad but the drama around it is at some times silly badly acted and way too soap opera like the story is very much the same as the most recent oscar winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what james cameron was competing against barely in his recreation 
yes i know talkies had just been invented for the cinema years earlier when this was produced in but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films it comes over as a filmed hammy stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines rolling their eyes using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema which i suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen the gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film it is now only of interest for titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film in next chronological order they could see titanic a night to remember titanic to see how the cinema s depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years there have been many documentaries and tv films made including the atrocious sos titanic on my version which is a dvd david mccallum gives the introduction it was he who played harold bride marconi s junior wireless operator in a night to remember still the best feature film please read my tribute to walter comments on imdb under howard morley demon co uk and gave the commentary on the series of videos entitled end of a dream so he was well qualified to give the narration of more interest i found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the us senate hearing which is also on the dvd actors speak the actual words spoken by lightoller nd officer j bruce ismay managing director of white star harold bride and others including gloria stewart the old rose in titanic whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors 
this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn t that great sure chaos and inside man are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense but i found chaos more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film swordfish the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find a distributor in the u k and u s a it s true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films but that doesn t mean that it is a pleasant film to watch watch it if nothing else is on t v but you ll probably get bored with after awhile 
i really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn t work for me i have seen most of kitamura s output and have found it to be very variable alive like all of his films has an interesting plot some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity however these qualities are in painfully short supply in alive the plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film unfortunately the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going before reaching fairly predictable places the action is just about passable with the final fight pretty cool and the earlier one about ok the earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camera work making for less coherency there are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly the characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring the film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it with about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller but the full length film is dull only recommended to very patient and determined kitumura fans 
the trailers for this film were better than the movie what waste of talent and money wish i would ve waited for this movie to come on dvd because at least i wouldn t be out the movie totally misses the mark what could have been a great movie for all actors turned out to be a b movie at best movie moved very slow and just when i thought it was going somewhere it almost did but then it didn t in this day and age we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film and this film offered neither the whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good however not sure if it was the way it was directed the lighting the delivery of lines the writing or what but nothing came from it lot of hype for nothing i was very disappointed in this film and i m telling everyone not to see it the cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well and the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the film what a disappointment 
this is a dumb movie maybe my judgment wouldn t be so harsh if the film didn t promise so much but i just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turn i didn t have any beef with the acting but i thought the characters were awful the movie starts off with clive owen s character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is and how he planned the perfect bank robbery something he frequently reminds us of later oh yeah he also tells us he s in a prison cell although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong and you re long gone before the police show up but clive owen s scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as i can tell he also has to control hostages negotiate with cops and most fantastically of all perform a this old house job on the bank s stockroom and hide out there for a week i hope he brought enough food and a bucket to pee in and then sneak out again yeah that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me clive this plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it didn t fall apart was the screenwriter said so and then there are the many unexplained details why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages who the hell is jodie foster s character and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she doesn t have to tell denzel washington her agenda because it s above his pay scale how dumb are these cops that they can t figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery how did the robbers slip away and why did clive owen stick around for a week how did they find out about the bank chairman s past and the number and contents of his safe deposit box why the hell would clive owen let in jodie foster or the cops since when do they make toy ak s that look real up close how the hell do you bug a pizza box anyway how did clive owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours undetected did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop denzel to slip him a diamond none of these questions are ever answered there are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen off screen but i never felt that way about inside man it felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie or these questions never had any answers in the first place and that s weak particularly annoying is jodie foster s character who won t disclose what she does but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is we re just supposed to take her word for it i guess the only reason i gave this movie two stars is i laughed at denzel s taxi cab and pina colada gags and at the kid s outrageous video game other than that this movie has no redeeming features 
i have never seen any of spike lee s prior films as their trailers never caught my interest i have seen and admire denzel washington and jodie foster s work and have several of their dvds i was however entirely disappointed with this movie if this film is any indication of spike lee s ability as a director my advice would be to get a job and stop wasting the time and talent of others i wonder if some of the other imdb commentators watched the same movie that i d seen i can only assume from their sappy lovelorn reviews that their adoration of spike lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work i only paid in a second run theater and still felt i d wasted my money the imdb trivia page says it all shot in days how can you expect to shoot a big budget blockbuster as the media hype promised in such a short time no wonder there was such a weak performance by all ron howard was first going to direct the film he may have done this project some justice given more time to do so of course though the writing was atrocious the premise had some merits ok maybe not i m sorry this film was so rife with pitiful clich s implausible scenes and lousy characterizations that maybe even he couldn t have made much of it hey ron be sure to thank russell good call jodie foster filmed her part in three weeks and it showed her portrayal of a fixer who makes people s problems go away was as unbelievable as the script she was given did she even want to be there other peeves how many bank robbers would bother to come to the door and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank and he d better keep away or else when detective frazier denzel washington comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet how many bank robbers without a gun would have led a cop much less let a cop back out to the front door allowing the police officer to walk behind him det frazier later claimed to have given the robber every reason to shoot me why then in their brief struggle didn t he even try to expose the robber s face that may have gotten the response he was looking for a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification and why did it take steve stevie steve o the robber s accomplice so long to come and help out i understand that these weren t your typical bank robbers they had a different agenda and didn t want anyone harmed but the cops had no reason to think that they wouldn t to them it was a desperate situation why then when two of the bad guys stepped outside to pick up the pizzas were they not taken down first of all how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield is this spike lee s version of ny city or snl s taking them down would have reduced the bad guy s numbers screwed up their plans and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up if not there at least would be fewer bad guys inside give swat something to do or send them home what police department in this country would have allowed madeline white jodie foster to just waltz right into the bank and discuss a matter with the robbers that she would not disclose to them first she had no authority no governmental credentials and besides this was after all already a hostage situation add one more why wouldn t the bank ceo christopher plummer just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago screw sentimentality the diamonds he could have sold who was that schmuck the character not the actor with the jersey accent that conveniently volunteered and said he knew the recording was albanian but yet he himself couldn t speak it sir put your hand down and his ex wife what a schlump she was both were totally unbelievable when interrogating suspects why did det frazier continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist i e telling the elderly woman she could go and then she couldn t then could then couldn t give me a break who after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites couldn t deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages near the end of the movie a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room behind which clive owens hid out for a week where did the materials come from the drywall studs it was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer so he could relieve himself the bank employees hadn t complained about the smell all week long hello after such a debacle since the documents had fallen into the robber s hands what kind of references was ms white expecting to get from the bank ceo seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail due to her failure and last but certainly not least what s with the electric glide that denzel did how stupid was that supposed to indicate his resolve to bring these guys to justice he looked rather like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart while trying to prevent a bowel movement cheeee zheeee other than the mediocre plot lousy script bad acting and overall pitiful directing yada yada yada hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not 
i ve seen most of ryuhei kitamura s work and i ve come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage with versus and aragami kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget so what happened in alive to be more blunt the answer would be nothing nothing happened in alive it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plot adapted from a comic book by tsutomu takahashi alive is an examination of the life of one tenshu yashiro played by hideo sasaki a death row convict who survives his execution he is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments he chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for it s host s humanity grants supernatural powers naturaly at some point that parasite moves into yashiro the bad thing is that doesn t happen very soon similar to aragami alive sets it s first half in establishing the basic exposition characters are introduced their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered the whole thing even takes place in just one set the first major problem of that comparison is that while aragami was just a minute movie alive drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long that length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case dialogue is dry monotonous delivered without any sense of emotion or depth characters themselves aren t much interesting there were some small attempts at making alive a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic evil government people against super powered protagonist whom yes you guessed it saves the girl in the end like i previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set and after two hours that does get boring even worse the set design itself wasn t even interesting to begin with and doesn t do much to improve on other aspects of the film now after that first part is over one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning sadly that is not the case the two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from hollywood movies complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers they re just not interesting or fun kitamura s creativity from versus is gone the small set even limits his often very impressive camera work and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights a shame really evidently aragami was better on all accounts and kitamura had learned something from alive so it wasn t at least a total loss watching this movie if only to understand the errors made how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie 
a fun concept but poorly executed except for the fairly good makeup effects there s really not much to it there are obvious problems for example after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days and once he s deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time in any case the movie has far worse problems than that the cinematography is decidedly low budget tv show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around robert john burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling charlton heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch the only scary thing is that lucinda jenney and kari wuhrer are both even worse the only reason why i m giving this movie as high as i am is that once the movie enters its last or so and joe mantegna s character takes over the movie develops a fun campy cheesefest slaughterhouse feel and the gangster s crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch the ending if predictable is also nicely mean avoid unless you re a king o phile or are really psyched up at the idea of the voice of fat tony from the simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp 
so thinner yep this steven bachman read steven king yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from a gypsy elder who he just killed the story itself is there no doubt about it but i don t know why i didn t enjoy it more than i could have i guess what really distracted me was the actors i mean who s the lead robert john burke who s he and fer crying out loud can someone please stop hiring joseph mantegna for every italian mafioso role there ever is and while we re at it does every mafioso have to have a pasta cooking italian mother the only good acting job done here is under pounds of makeup michael constantine as the gypsy elder he s pretty good but the rest i make you all better actors 
i began watching this movie with low expectations as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a s k novel a novel i never read i m glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn t nothing close to good but it manages to keep you interested what really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors the movie is overlong hasn t no nice shots and no scares the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap the only things good are that as i said it keeps you interested i guess the book must be good without using much horror cliches my vote 
i am not one of those who think king is a great writer his books are fine distractions for a few hours and often have interesting premises however they in my opinion fall apart pretty rapidly if you give them any serious thought this film suffers from being a pretty exact re telling of king s story if you have read the book there are zero surprises no changes no altering of scenes or characters this is a film made by king fans for king fans for the rest of us there is nothing terrible about the film it is a gypsy curse horror with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for to become thinner the final third has some severe structural problems and the slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a little there are worse ways to spend minutes of your life but you might as well read the book because there is nothing new here 
this move reminded my of tales from the crypt keeper it has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve i think that s always the them in a crypt story the same goes for the bad acting very bad acting i enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didn t like it and i wasn t expecting much whenever i watch a stephen king movie i don t expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels i have read the shining and carrie and they were great books i love how carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such it was so good but i noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies the endings were very different then the movie versions i assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy i ending of thinner is the worst so cheesy i want to read the book to find out the real ending i suggest everyone who intends to read stephen king s novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare and that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book i intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies i m sure if they were made into movies they were real good books and the screenplay went terribly wrong 
as interesting as a sheet of cardboard this dispensable period piece has little going for it it s overly wordy and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the real life characters must have felt as they dodged the french revolution s fickle hand of justice eric rohmer at it shows 
i was really looking forward to seeing this film but after watching it i was really disappointed the best bit was when stephen king was in it rober john berk cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others a few of the performances even made me laugh out loud the film was was not as i imagined it after reading the book which was awesome i imagined it darker and a lot scarier if i was stephen i would be really mad i don t know why they changed the ending i thought the ending of the book was very good if you just found out the pie killed your daughter you wouldn t feed it to anyone else would you book was so much better 
a novel by remarque a cast that looks great on paper a left wing refugee struggling to remain in paris between the wars a gestapo officer undercover it s a pity there s no synergy here the bits and pieces never coalesce stories about left wing refugees in france don t have to be this dull read arthur koestler s memoir scum of the earth if you can find it or his chilling dialogue with death ditto to me the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details the leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados the norman apple brandy i welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly but according to the film it s only sold in cheap low class saloons vive le tabac parisien that s what i say references to intoxicating liquors do abound here that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists i enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background i wasn t disappointed this time it was for byrrh a very unusual choice this film would rate a if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals the film s indifferent score is by louis gruenberg gruenberg is best known if you can call it that for his opera the emperor jones based on the o neill play it premi red at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul robeson the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence tibbett it should surface again soon though they re running out of potentially marketable operas to revive opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles boyer s character operates under his czech aliases two of them are wozzeck and gunther both prominent roles in german opera is that just coincidence name dropping just seems to be part of this film notice that they call up himmelstoss on the phone himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in remarque s earlier all quiet on the western front well the in jokes are all in place guess there wasn t time to develop any drama 
this made for tv movie was shown on a women s channel naturally as a man why do i even attempt to watch this i don t know but i should have my head examined and director and writer simon gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does he takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in number one bore is joyce hyser as the wife i couldn t wait for him to drop her her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie the other femme fatale was nichole hiltz about the coldest person you d ever want to meet her looks didn t warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious only a fool could miss definitely a loser tembi locke was pretty good but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband again played as a guy who is a loser by david deluise rounding out our cast of losers is anthony denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero stephen jenkins as our hero or should i say victim was not that good at first i thought he just a bad actor but later i believed it he never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout although as a man i became enraged when the two women got away with it men beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder lmn is the channel beware note having watched this a second time by mistake i am convinced on my initial thoughts especially on the writer director simon gornick i still believe he has disgraced the male species and should be horse whipped only saving grace in this film is tembi locke who doesn t have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of jenkins hyser hiltz and deluise around her plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse down with gornick s movie and his vacant stars in it please lmn don t show this trite again 
blows my mind how this movie got made i watched it while i worked at home writing emails and answering the phone i only watched it because i hoped the revenge part would be good needless to say the revenge and the forced plot twists were not worth the emails during which they were watched in fact i m not even sure what happened at the end any more the acting was as bad as re enactment scenarios on the fbi files show by far the worst re enactments really only arrest and trial can possibly be as bad at re enactments i didn t even know that the leading man was in third eye blind until i looked the movie up here on imdb but its obvious why he hasn t made any movies since i hope he is a good singer 
there is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer actress nichole hiltz she is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge directed by simon gornick the film stars joyce hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin spouse oh but not by conventional means she plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl nichole hiltz as her weapon of choice she wants nichole as tuesday to get close to her ex the handsome but dull stephan jenkins who should stick to music to embarrass him and ruin his life david deluise is good in his few brief moments and former crime story star anthony dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful then evil and devious she also handles vulnerable and maybe a bit psychotic well she s also quite hot though there s no naughty bits show so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at but the performance is kind of wasted in this movie which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend 
the only reason i remember this movie is because it was and still is the biggest waste of time and money ever spent i was and my friend was we were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most ok nd most we walked out feeling so insulted we wanted our money back but the time could never be regained the editing is what killed this movie as the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in x vw bugs shooting rockets at the truck please rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium what s worse is the these vw s manage to get shots off of a rocket launcher you would see on vw with rockets fire of them cut around the truck with the last one attached come back a second later with two rockets attached fire another then go in front of the truck and now it s back to a full set of rockets we toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened it looks like they just ran out of money and stopped just ridiculous 
just a warning this is the worst movie i have seen in years i couldn t watch it to the end it is a pure waste of time i really feel sorry for snipes that he ended up in such a movie there really is not much to say about it horrible acting incredibly bad lines story everything the only reason i would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn t be just to tell you one scene the police are searching for snipes and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars they are shooting around inside the building but still they are whispering so that snipes doesn t suspect a thing 
the us appear to run the uk police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that cid officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub this has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of real uk police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public i can see that mr snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like charles dance was doing in it is a mystery worse than the worse low budget b film of the s an hour and a half of suicide and time i will never get back avoid it like the veritable plague 
a lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in leon then other parts felt like some other movie i don t know which but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie it was kind of nice to watch but it would have been fantastic if the story would have been more original the theme little girl bad assassin from leon is just tweaked a little the opening scenes are really good it is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen in the movies my biggest problem was to remember which parts was from leon nikita and if they where from the french or american version if you have not seen leon then this is a good movie if you liked this movie then i can recommend leon best regards rick
i can hardly believe that this inert turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works i ve quite enjoyed the experience of enduring the lady and the duke and no other word but enduring will do left me in a vile mood a condition relieved only by reading the imdb user comment by ali for not only has rohmer attempted with success to make us see the world through the genre art of th century france but as ali has pointed out has shown at the cost of alienating his audience the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times the director has accomplished something undeniably difficult but i question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so or for us to watch the dull results of his labor 
don t really know where to start with one of the worst films i have had the displeasure to watch in a very long time from the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited london for even day will agree was not london to the much unexplained way how snipe s character managed to escape the country back to the us without a single problem then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in america how on earth did grandma agree to that he s an assassin well that s the ending how about during the film well unfortunately that didn t fare much better we have british cops driving an amazing range of cars i m sure it was an eighties vauxhall belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation but a modern subaru imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior so or whoever the gun toting arm of the met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after snipe s along with the cia there were children walking around but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him does this happen in london no it doesn t i live there we also have the very implausible travel from central london to the airport let s say heathrow for arguments sake within minutes of receiving a call we also have terrible american accents a young girl who s posher than the queen but lives in elephant castle what does it say for british police when helicopters and a number of officers at snipe s location can t find snipe s and he manages to evade capture by hiding behind some stairs the train station was obviously not even on uk soil and the fight scene sound effects were terrible the plot was also extremely poor boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before but there were a few notable actors cast in this film what were they thinking and please don t let that sway you to watch this film this film didn t seem to know what it wanted to be if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an assignation then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it if you want an all out action film which this is not then continuity and scenery can be put to the side 
every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films i seek out to watch isn t always impeccable i normally would stay away from stuff like this but i was duped by some glowing reviews and the rohmer pedigree there s an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted digital back drops of revolution era france this quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene what we re left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in th century france none of the characters are appealing or sympathetic the pace is so languid the dialogue so arduous and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to rohmer that i ended up not caring whose head rolled who was harboring who or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about the movie would ve greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build up and a music score there s some fine classical music used at the very end despite being so talky the film plays much like a silent film and the worst kind of film at that a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects only the most astute french historians will find anything to take from this film as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle the lady is english and a royalist otherwise avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia i dozed off twice 
i m shocked that there were people who liked this movie i saw it at tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny i felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience but honestly the plot to this movie needed major revision it didn t even make sense one second the characters question what exactly it is that they re snorting the next scene they re hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it also the ending just took the cake i m not going to spoil the magnificent conclusion but it pretty much blended right in with the rest of the horrible plot script see this movie for comedy if you must 
tasteless i can t even write intelligently about the movie i laughed the entire movie it wasn t supposed to be funny matt farnsworth has no clue what he is doing his story is written it seems without any knowledge of iowa culture and the meth problem i know farnsworth is from iowa which makes his movie even more puzzling to me why do the two main characters have accents it doesn t make any sense the acting was mediocre at best and at times hard to watch gratituous violence and sex filled the movie i am guessing that the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy but it came across as unbelievable and offensive the ending of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all i could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief as i walked out of the theatre everyone else who was leaving was laughing along with me the ending of the movie was meant to evoke tears but it did the exact opposite do not waste your time on this horrible movie unless you want to see ignorant sappy overacted clich d drivel 
 iowa wants to be requiem for a dream for midwest meth but it comes across as a hard r rated reefer madness yes drugs are bad and meth is horribly pernicious as an addiction and how it destroys people families and communities but these characters who are either dumb or ridiculous and the eye rolling plot won t teach that lesson to anyone while writer director star matt farnsworth has some charisma on screen his partner diane foster plays a wincibly silly wide eyed innocent corrupted by drugsas was already satirized by susan sarandon in the rocky horror picture show i really felt sorry for her for all the totally unnecessary nudity she was put through it wasn t until the end of the film that i realized i was supposed to think these two were recent high school graduates to explain some of their naivet as we are bombarded by their school photos but if so they even looked older than the folks on the o c while they have good chemistry on screen they are a pale imitation of a badlands type couple the guest stars are badly used michael t weiss who was so good in tv s the pretender is completely ludicrous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is just plain crazy as his character pretty much ruins any social significance for the film rosanna arquette has to be even sleazier than she rolled around for david cronenberg as a very low rent livia soprano john savage even has to mouth the old baby boomer excuses about i did pot but this is worse a goth chick shows up with the odd explanation that she s a stripper from des moines the obligatory latino drug dealer appears in iowa with a limited budget the interior view of meth use is portrayed quite vividly with quite scary hallucinations we certainly see them go crazy while the iowa locations are used very well including an amusing scene of a propane gas robbery the accents and church references are confusingly southern baptist guns seem to be used by law abiding and law breaking citizens here more than in any inner city drug dealing movie the songs of iowa s best known bard greg brown are used throughout but oddly are not listed in the credits i hope they were used with permission i caught this at its commercial run in nyc because i missed it at the tribeca film festival where it got considerable and inexplicable buzz 
the often reliable leonard maltin says this is a delightful romance and that sanders is superb maltin must have confused this movie with something else sanders is snide and droll and superb as usual you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three but dull wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately the storyline itself an autobiography with sanders as a suave jewel thief francois eugene vidocq who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels is entertaining enough but it has the same kind of hollow historical hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as marie antoinette and certainly the deplorable forever amber which screams for a classy remake though in his defense sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character it is all for naught i am an unabashed douglas sirk fan but this is and it is one of sirk s earliest american efforts lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid breast heaving potboilers sirk is just getting his feet wet here and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with magnificent obsession and hit his stride bombarding us with such estrogen fests as all that heaven allows written on the wind and imitation of life but scandal in paris is hardly his best work a relatively low budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming 
this crew versus monsta has been done a hundred times sometimes better this one was pretty slow moving only the monster s resurrection was really worthwhile attempts at character developments gets botched by routine yeah routine is the word went straight to video in france no wonder
the fact that i did not like the music is a very personal opinion the historical innacuracies are not i do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary but some important aspects are missing especiallly if other people comment falsely because of it abbu abas was the mastermind of this operation which was staged and reorganized due to discovery on board the shiph in order to free terrorists from israeli prisons one of which was samir kuntar a heinous terrorist whose story you can find by searching for klinghoffer samir kuntar on google abbu abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations even if he never set foot on the achile lauro ben laden never set foot on the planes that hit the wtc did he possible spoilers the movie almost excuses the terrorists actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived always accentuating and exaggerating how much the israeli s have done to hurt them however they never portray the hurt that the palestinians have ever caused to the israelis the movie uses quite horrid images from the sabra and chatila horror and nothing is said understating the general belief that it was israel who was responsible without ever mentioning that it was a syrian les lebanese army who conducted the massacre the acting was generally very bad but i guess that s what can be expected from opera singers on another note i am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the innocent hostages against the armed terrorists and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of zionism imagine how unsympathetic his wife was spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea i hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is wink wink 
although it got some favorable press after playing at the toronto intl film festival there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this one it s an ultra low budget canadian film two it s written directed and starring the same person usually a bad sign unless it s woody allen george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers but despite my watching it with lowered expectations it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possible in a nutshell bad script bad acting terrible directing don t waste your time or money on this turkey it claims to be a comedy but i only laughed twice plus there is awful music blaring throughout how this got any attention i ll never know 
i like animated shows i enjoy the nick fare pretty much including hey arnold but moving a tv show to the big screen isn t easy and this just didn t feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the show and it just didn t move along that well judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didn t score that well with them either 
i have to admit that i m a great fan of this show so you must know how disappointed i got when i watched this movie first of all the plot was awful i thought it was going to be something more interesting like to see what happened to arnold fathers or something more interesting but nooooooo a maniac wants to destroy arnold s house between many other places so many people tries to stop this i must admit that the plot wasn t so bad after all but what really sucked were the steps that arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac they become friends of a spy they drive a bus based on a video game for god sake and to worse everything they make super moves on the bus things that many persons had already tried and died but not arnold gerald and helga cause they are experts on a video game honestly my mom my sister even me got really disappointed after watching this movie cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon i must admit that i used to enjoy hey arnold it was one of my favorite cartoons on nickelodeon but after this crap of movie i m not quite sure if i m going to watch hey arnold as i used to watch it on the past other thing nickelodeon with that enormous number of dynamite i can assure you that not a simple street would explode i think that the whole city could explode with that oh and please if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that don t do more movies you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good honestly i think this was the worst way to end this show a good show transformed into this crap of movie 
much has been made of rohmer s use of digital technology to fill in the background at times it works well the scene where grace and her maid witness from afar the king s execution is particularly striking at other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look resembling a home video however the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer we know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters to be frank i did not care at all what happened to the lady or the duke the other major failing i regret to say is the performance of lucy russell in the leading role she is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance ok she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend mme de meyler an excellent performance by the debutante helena dubiel seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience also watch her hands when she is expressing emotion all in all a very disappointing film particularly given the positive reviews on this site 
amen to magsel there was a lot of confusion going on first off how do you know which movie you are purchasing henry cele stars in every one of them i bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries what a letdown it would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped david hasselhoff spelling is ok for popcorn tv but he was not believable in this film where was his english accent and what s with the love story the movie was supposed to be about a young man s rise to military power not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the english maiden looking for her daddy if i had paid more than for this movie i would have to call the police because that would be a crime 
as a south african it s an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original shaka zulu mini this addition to the series is appalling the original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist leader and warrior a man who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribes in south africa the plot of this film however is nothing but hogwash scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the mid nineties while omar sharif and henry cele are good actors what is david hasselhoff doing here rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile i kept expecting blond busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits for no apparent reason not that this would ve been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after pints of beer at a fancy dress party where someone s caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an african theme for his next blockbuster 
yes i ll admit it i believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work about the trials and tribulations of people living in mexico city concerning their sexual lives and so i was really expecting to finally see a mexican movie in ages that was both popular and interesting to watch unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing the story presents us with two couples both with very obvious marital problems when a third party comes into the life of each couple their problems reach a pivotal point or absolute absurd the plot then turns into a battle of the sexes the stance taken by each group yes they literally group girls with girls and boys with boys is blatantly stupid and childish i guess the humor was supposed to be there and it all goes from bad to worse the performances range from good miss zavaleta to mediocre mr bichir with serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera prima however the flat circumstances that make up the plot the one dimensional characters the very poor if not stupid perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc make the movie fail miserably spyl has had an impressive good reception at the box office believe the hype at your own risk 
it s difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong because i think the problem begins with the books themselves alexander mccall smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an africa that does not exist he s done for botswana what borat did for kazakhstan not as successfully but based in as much fact once i realised this it ceased to gall me that jill scott an american singer actress is cast as mma ramotswe if she is to represent a land that is not africa how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not african she s not the only american on the cast mma makutsi is played by anika noni rose both women are far far too young for the roles they re playing and far too glamorous both brutally murder the local accents and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting scott s mma ramotswe is bouncy cute and soft rose s mma makutsi is an annoying motor mouthed bitch the result is almost unwatchable the principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of lucian msamati who turns in a decent performance as mr jlb matekoni hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books but i find myself unable to blame msamati for this he s a shining light in an ocean of suckage the contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script to me mccall smith s writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad he refuses to be edited as a result his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific and characters that change name mid sentence it is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse the dialogue is now largely anglicised characters speak of opening up and sensitivity to needs mma ramotswe and mr jlb matekoni flirt openly mma makutsi moans about not having a computer but given her constantly restyled hair makeup and jewellery i m surprised she doesn t have a macbook in her handbag along with her visa card so what are we left with here it s difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly most of the things i like about the original books are apocryphal anyway mccall smith paints a fictional botswana populated with cute non threatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdom nuggets it reads well despite linguistic travesty but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were it just isn t true given that it s hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does it remains to be seen whether european and american audiences will even notice however 
this reboot is like a processed mcdonald s meal compared to ang lee s very good but very underrated the incredible hulk ang lee s the hulk is a comic book movie for the thinking person the hulk takes some time to appear about minutes but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist s core he does his best to avoid losing control but as he admits when he does give in to his rage he likes it now compare this to edward norton s turn where there is no display of conflict in his personality and he turns into the hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits beats per minute not not but exactly to this reviewer this felt akin to the introduction of midi chlorians in the phantom menace which tell how strong the force is with one as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test in the movie all ed norton s bruce banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist and for the record it is extremely difficult to get one s pulse rate up to even through a very exhilarating run especially for a physically fit person emotions drive eric bana s hulk he has repressed memories of his mother s death and his father s role in his early life on the surface he is calm but there underneath there is significant anger enough rage to fuel the hulk when it is unleashed but the hulk never kills intentionally even his attackers mostly he just wants to get away or close to betty ross jennifer connelly he incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision in the movie the visual effects are there but as necessary the action scenes and there are plenty of them are necessary to the plot unlike the movie where action is inserted for the sake of action in his quest to turn it into a fugitive story ed norton loses focus on how bruce banner feels about the hulk to him the hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry and louis leterrier the director picking up on ed norton s cue fails to add any emotional dimension to the banner hulk relationship the story can be summed up as banner is pursued and hulk kicks butt banner is pursed and hulk kick butt repeat as necessary the only thing that went against the movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the version however even as i am a fan of the comics i would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy s dream but has heart over the comics loyal but manufactured and soulless version any day perhaps ang lee should have read more comics iron man also released in is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic book roots and has heart 
revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since in fact most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events unfortunately what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom one cares not who wins loses dies or lives just end it as soon as possible this is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology scenes of paris and the french countryside have a cardboard quality about them they might better be done on a bare stage and left that way one cannot expect the amazing effects of the house of the flying daggers or the golden compass but after all this is a digitally mastered production characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms in my view this film turns the french revolution of the s into the papier mache revolution of a papier colle world 
i dislike this movie a lot if you ve read the puzo s books or at least have watched very closely the two first movies specially the first one you re going to agree with me compared with the corleone s saga presented by puzo s novel the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous the characters and the relationships among them are distorted the story ends up reaching nowhere although it appears to go to some direction during the movie it is understandable that different times should be expected for the corleone s saga in the s and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before but in the other hand i don t know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies in contexts when they didn t fit why this it sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film s qualities what will never be understandable is the fact that mario puzo coppola and al pacino joined together to make this a man who directed pieces like apocalypse now and godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies so does al pacino for being the actor he is but mario puzo shouldn t have written this how come he damaged all his previous work what a shame my friend the puzo s novel the last don is a s story about the mob and it is great we can never tell the same about the plot for the godfather iii 
this movie is complete crap avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs it is rambling and incoherent i pride myself on plumbing the depths of s sleaze cinema from everything from salo to salon kitty i like being shocked but i need a coherent story however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang i mean its just plain hard to sit through not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly please i know the cover is interesting what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman s bare ass but don t waste your time or money as you won t get either back 
the godfather part i was a stunning look inside the fictional corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of the godfather part ii shows that young man s acceptance of his new role his desensitization of character as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime the first two parts of this saga of this transformation of michael corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history then along came the godfather part iii michael corleone is now the aging don of the corleone family he shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is michael corleone michael s plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies michael s daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to michael realizing that his entire life as don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in protecting his family the godfather part ii ends with michael corleone reaching the lowest of the lows having his own brother killed before part iii was made the godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man s journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him family loyalty part iii paints the picture of michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance this greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films the godfather part iii is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made the only solution to the problem that is this final installment of the godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with michael s shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed 
the danish movie slim slam slum surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date i didn t think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad b movies but this one deserves the gold it s not funny it s bad acting it s bad filmed and the storyline is bad the only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it i truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie stjerner uden hjerner as the badest danish film ever made and that s truly something congratulations in advance 
what a crappy movie the worst of the worst this movie is as entertaining as a dead slug no talent what so ever actors stupid plot who wrote this script was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what my friends younger brother is in the th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur movie for their school project which outdid this geeky movie this is by far the worst film i have seen in my life there is just no excuse for this flick 
i have never seen a movie as bad as this it is meant to be a fun movie but the only joke is at the start and it is not funny if you like this sort of movie then you may just be able to give it a vote of if it had the necessary votes it would truly belong on the bottom 
slim slam slum is a sad and disappointing picture there is absolutely no reason to this sorry excuse for a picture don`t go there what ever you do don`t watch tv shop for hours straight instead that way you will be slightly amused 
the show had great episodes this is not one of them it s not a terrible episode it s just hard to follow up the man that was death all through the house and dig that cat he s real gone this episode is about a couple that has just been married peggy ammanda plummer and charles stephen shellen in the first five minutes you find out that charles only married peggy for her money the two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion charles soon finds out a secret of peggy s family in my opinion you should watch this episode but just don t expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season 
this was one of the worst movies ever it was so bad i was laughing through the whole movie the plot was so cheesy especially the end this movie turns from an end of the world disaster to save the eels i mean c mon and i swear i think they use sock puppets for the eels and there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced how predictable it was so terrible that my mom my sister and i couldn t finish it and when we did finish it it was about a year later the second time we watched it and we finished it this time we did mst k like comments throughout the movie summary only watch this if you re a movie basher make hilarious comments watch this at a sleepover for laughs and i mean huge laughs also watch for mockery the metaphor that explains this movie this movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets 
actually had to stop it don t get me wrong love bad monster movies but this one was way too boring regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere the actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts was way too obvious a clich this film totally betrays the cover on the dvd which looks pretty interesting from the cover one expects a giant monster but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels moved on to watch another film called the killer rats but that s another review deep shock was really crap a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget 
i don t get this the movie obviously has a pretty good budget it has very good cinematography it has nice pacing good editing and pretty good directing too then why oh why didn t they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and why oh why did they hire such lousy actors that can t act their way out of a paper bag this movie could have been good at most times it looks good and feels good but in the end you realize that the movie was no good at all so i would say it s a good production but a bad movie too bad actually and eels come one really 
a mediocre sci fi channel original picture a little squirmish but not much the nuclear powered submarine u s s jimmy carter is on a mission deep below thick frigid ice near the north pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric eels a member of the crew simmone jade mackinnon thinks she has devised a way to communicate with the monsters but is not given much chance for vague reasons also among the crew are david keith mark sheppard and sean whalen this movie could have been somewhat better if the eels monsters were not so cartoonish 
this is the worst movie ever made the acting the script the location everything i would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie but even they were bad you would think that a movie with the word beach in it s title would have good looking women in it wouldn t you 
is nothing else on tv are you really bored well then watch phat beach however don t rent it and definitely do not buy it that would be a big mistake i watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard however there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at if you are looking for an extremely funny hood movie then watch friday if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie something that this movie tries at kind of watch something like hoop dreams or jason s lyric if you are lookin for some good black booty go watch a dominique simone porn flick because the nudity in this movie is nearly non existent however if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable go ahead and watch it you will be slightly amused out of 
watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and bucks for rental in my life if nothing catastrophic happens before i die this will be the biggest regret of my life who ever even thought about this movie or financed deserves a kick between the legs because that s where they were thinking when they made this movie it s about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry he joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast where they meet girls and such only the fat guy doesn t get a girl skin flicks don t annoy me i take em for face value but this movie tries to be more than a skin flick it s about fat guy looking for love in some girl but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry he finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies only he has his lady anyways the dialogue is super horrible for even a c movie it supports a ton of black stereotypes no character development it s a glorified porno movie without any porn in it never ever watch this movie 
i watched phat beach on cable for a while and i sort of enjoyed it the fat guy is the best character as he seems to be a nice guy the rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men i like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year s attitudes and fads phat beach is also funny because the low budget babes in this movie are strictly home girls most low budget movies have that local babe quality and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for jc penneys some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the youngsters went wild over what was essentially some really over used high mileage skank there were some cuties too that is the charm of these low budget crappy movies you will see a lot of doggies and some real cuties i checked up on some of them at imdb and seven years later phat beach is their only credit too bad it would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a where are they now book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return what happened there are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on tv you wonder what ever happened to x anyhow this movie mostly blows but it has some funny moments 
it was great to see some of my favorite stars of years ago including john ritter ben gazarra and audrey hepburn they looked quite wonderful but that was it they were not given any characters or good lines to work with i neither understood or cared what the characters were doing some of the smaller female roles were fine patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts they showed some talent and it is sad they didn t go on to star in more and better films sadly i didn t think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role the film appears to have some fans and i was very open minded when i started watching it i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie cat s meow and all his early ones from targets to nickleodeon so it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this one it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other five years later bogdanovich s ex girlfriend cybil shepherd had a hit television series called moonlighting stealing the story idea from bogdanovich of course there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines bottom line it ain t no paper moon and only a very pale version of what s up doc 
as a big fan of the original film it s hard to watch this show the garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake the mood is never there instead it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff but his snappy wardrobe and swank apartment don t fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting character he does his best to make it work but samantha egger is a really bad choice the english accent and california looks can t hold a candle to barbara stanwick s velvet voice and sex appeal lee j cobb tries mightily to fashion barton keyes but even his performance is just gruff without style it feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is 
when someone remakes a classic movie the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original also there s a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences well the tv version of double indemnity has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the original the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all fred macmurray was great as the lecherous leering insurance agent walter neff in the original richard crenna just seems world weary and tired edward g robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurray s boss barton keys lee j cobb a fine actor appears almost bored with the proceedings samantha eggar is all wrong as the conniving back stabbing phyllis dietrichson while barbara stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place robert webber in the old richard gaines role as robinson s boss norton and john fiedler taking the porter hall role as the crucial witness bring some life to the movie in particular webber recreates the norton role well in a s context however after the movie starts the whole thing just sort of lies there without any life or electricity this is one film that never should have been remade 
this tv remake of the billy wilder classic is inferior to the original surprise first the good things lee j cobb makes a terrific barton keyes he s not as good as edward g robinson of course but he s the only reason to watch this this remake s only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of lola dietrichson the step daughter of the femme fatale phyllis dietrichson and that s it for the good things the bad things are many the director records everything in an indifferent manner if you watched the film with the sound muted you d hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening because of modern bad taste the film must be in color instead of black and white because of s bad taste all the sets are distractingly ugly walter neff s expensive apartment in particular is hideous the modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways train trips were a bit more unusual in the s than in the s so mr dietrichson s decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance men stopped wearing hats which prevents walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white haired mr dietrichson women in mourning stopped wearing veils which robs samantha eggar of a prop barbara stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene oddly lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them stephen bochco keeps much of the billy wilder raymond chandler script the same but he makes a lot of tiny inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular outrageously the famous motorcycle cop banter is gone but look closely and you ll see what looks like a post production cut where those lines should have been bochco may not be to blame richard crenna is passable as walter neff what might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid phyllis dietrichson instead we get samantha eggar who comes off like a standard issue villainess from barnaby jones but who can blame eggar with a director who barely seems interested in what s happening in front of the camera how could barbara stanwyck herself have come off well 
watch the original with the same title from this made for tv movie is just god awful although it does use as far as i can tell almost the same dialog it just doesn t work is it the acting the poor directing ok so it s made for tv but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hands on the superb original especially as you ll be spoiled to the plot and won t enjoy the original as much as if you ve watched it first there are a few things that are different from the original it s shorter for once but all are for the worse the actors playing the parts here just don t fit the bill you just don t believe them and who could top edward g robinsons performance from the original if you want only watch it after you ve seen the original and even then you ll be very brave if you watch it through it s almost sacrilege 
when samantha eggar as phyllis dietrickson answers the door of her house swathed in a towel you realize that as competent an actress as eggar may be she doesn t have the hypnotic allure of barbara stanwyck and it is not entirely eggar s fault in the original film wilder had stanwyck not only appear in a towel but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house and she doesn t come out she appears almost as if by magic walter neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor there is a reason for this stanwyck is much higher than neff fred macmurray when they are first introduced it is not just the towel the towel adds to the seductive allure her pose is like a greek goddess overlooking her domain and in a strange way you feel as if from the start she is actually controlling the entire situation she has sexual even magic power this person is no ordinary housewife this person is a mystery with secrets hidden within back to the remake has crenna knock on the front door stanwyck s stand in eggar answers the door with a towel around her there is no appearance she simply opens the door the alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of stanwyck in is entirely absent in she opens the door with a towel around her it may be sexy in a charlie s angels sort of way but it s not nearly as mysterious the filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand wilder s point the script may have said phyllis appears in towel so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel the point is not the towel the point is the enigmatic quality of phyllis and the potential power she wields wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique the filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because that s what wilder did and in the choice of shot lost all of phyllis mystique richard crenna also seems miscast he seems like he s acting and not really in the midst of the dilemma part of the problem is crenna appears so much like a s actor he can t get into the s when macmurray first speaks into the microphone sweat begins to drip from his face no sweat on crenna and they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning in the original neff says i didn t get the money and i didn t get the woman in the version crenna says i didn t get the money and i didn t want the woman did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story or were they dumbing it down for a television audience this made for tv movie is a by the numbers rendition all the sharp edge of the original is lost the only stand out maybe is lee j cobb in the role made famous by edward g robinson but he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original this boring remake is a forgettable tv movie made probably by the same people who did gilligan s island they might as well have tried to remake citizen kane or gone with the wind if mediocrity is the best one can hope for what s the point the classic is a film with a capital f this made for tv remake deserves an f grade or maybe a d for dumb 
this remake of the classic billy wilder film double indemnity is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script this grade b tv fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general while hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize black and white films and sought disclaimers on wide screen movies that are shown in pan and scan versions the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake the first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script the billy wilder raymond chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified time slot with room for commercials then update the production with bland color photography smart upscale sets and tv familiar actors thus the brand new double indemnity eliminates the atmospheric black and white film noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original gone are the dusty shadowy claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists desires to escape their situations at whatever cost gone are the close bond between keyes and neff and the erotic attraction between neff and phyllis the look of jack smight s take on double indemnity is more dynasty than film noir phyllis dietrickson has a designer home to die for and neff s comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesman s salary not to mention the sporty mercedes convertible that he drives neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry if not money then perhaps murder for love or lust not in this version richard crenna shows little interest in samantha eggar and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister crenna fails to capture the cynicism of neff and his attempts at double entendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind only lee j cobb manages a creditable performance as keyes director jack smight and his three principals have all done much better work there was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule there was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on dvd and package it with the original film except to fill out a double disc package the only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting lackluster direction and tv grade production values the double indemnity should be titled indemnity because viewing it only underscores the perfection of the original movie 
you know when you re on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life story and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off well i had a similar sensation while watching this film okay i did actually choose to go and see aprile and i knew about nanni moretti s taste for making himself the one and only star from caro diario but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs i wanted to give moretti the madre of all slaps caro diario was funny unusual and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways in aprile however moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high pitched whine going on about how his politics are best or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment he also finds time to slag off films that he doesn t like something i thought was reserved for losers like me surely being in a position like his you d think he d try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this by making a proper film perhaps one with some ideas and a decent structure or maybe one that isn t completely dominated by his annoying voice and when he started fawning over his newborn baby i just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal preferably not a self obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music the next time someone you don t know tries to tell you their life story give them a slap from me every blow will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism 
back in the day i remembered seeing dumb nintendo power comics that had the same artwork as this show and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me i was not estatic but curious i was curious about how bad this show was gonna suck my friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy i m actually gay so i decided to watch the show with low expectations what a horrible experience first off i hate the new characters tiff and tuff are so dumb and i hate how so many fanboys drool over tiff it s sad i also hate how they made chef kalasaki or whatever his nonstraight name was a good guy who owned a restaurant bad move kids tv escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to the king dedede who sucks big time in this show and i hate the face of that one company that keeps supplying dedede with those awful weapons to destroy kirby so stupid i hate this show i then began to hate kirby even more since it was obvious nintendo was just aching to get kirby some popularity kirby ll never beat mario in the fight for coolness and kirby will always be nothing but a tiny little cream puff of gayness nuf said 
this insipid mini operetta featuring a eddy mcdonald prototype in a valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes it s silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers in under a minute he is packed off to morrocco where he lives a double life as the red shadow the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices with little acting ability and there s a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along this two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers with more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation 
despite unfortunately thinking itself to be a intelligent b important and c interesting fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly the script makes little sense the whole idea of the sado masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite and john lydon shows us all in the space of one movie why he should never have let himself out of music his performance is one note and irritating the only positive thing to be said is that harvey keitel manages to deliver a good turn his later bad lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act but mercifully his performance here is restrained 
this film was shrouded in scandal for so long that it became a very sought after item the outrage the mystery etc it had everything to be a great piece of film making but ultimately fails in every extent it s a terribly bad comedy a pathetic horror movie a lame erotic film the disc dvd includes a gorgeous booklet with stills interviews essays on bestiality etc as well as an extensive interview with the more than pretentious director for those who have heard about it but never seen it the package will seem fantastic until one actually sees the film disc contains the edited film badly translated to english but with good visual quality disc contains the director s cut in an awful transfer in french what can i say about the actual beast a hand puppet of kermit the frog would have been more effective and shocking 
encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake i ve seen films and this is truly one of the worst of them it s awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the film s only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film the only thing that prevents me giving this a score is harvey keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only 
i thought harvey keitel a young fresh from the sex pistols john lydon then as a bonus the music by ennio morricone i expected an old school edgy italian cop thriller that was made in america istead i got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying wtf too many unanswered questions and not enough action the result a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet keitel and lydon work well together so maybe quentin tarantino can reunite these guys with better script oh and the morricone score ok but not memorable overall not a waste of time but not a must see unless you are a hardcore keitel fan 
i wandered into this movie after watching the minute borat tonight and left quite disappointed i was a huge fan of wallace and gromit and routinely go to see animated films that being said i found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out but stayed waiting for this film to get better never happened the visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch especially in my opinion that of kate winslet and ian mckellen i had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was gandalf and magneto the problem with this movie for me is it s one of those animated features for the add set it registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an important message it looks a lot like busted oscar bait for the animated category and considering the way it s scoring with critics i wouldn t be surprised if the academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware but if you re looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats take my advice and wait for ratatouille 
this movie is little more than poorly made fetish porn and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era this was recommended to me by friend as a unique film experience he was right i suppose he meant that as a joke not disgusting not even that shocking just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art a little bit of camp value though i don t believe the makers of this film intended this and yes as a previous reviewer mentioned it s sex with a guy in a bear suit don t spend a lot of money on this try to borrow it if you must see it or contact me i d be happy to sell you my copy for half price i may have to see another of this particular director s films as he seems to have a certain following but if it s anything like this i will again regret another hours of my life gone forever 
ok maybe a year old like me was a little to old for this movie its about this pampered rat who lives in a palace then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet he ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants he will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats he plans to take the gem and to flood rat city the cool part about this movie is the slugs they do all the sound effects they sing make noises its awesome its also pretty funny ok bottom line it is aimed at year olds other wise a great movie to take a younger family member to see i didn t think the animation was real dreamworks art though more like wallace and gromit i thinkthey slacked a little on that the movie was just decent not worth spending for though sorry 
don t understand how these animated movies keep coming out and no matter how good or bad it is people love it i saw this movie with my two kids they like pretty much anything animated like most people who rated this film the theater was almost full and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast to tell the truth i was bored silly it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny there were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh but just didn t work my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie but not on this one my daughter fell asleep half way through also the kids thought the character animation looked weird i haven t heard that from them since seeing the polar express which gave my daughter nightmares trust me i m not the type who looks for the negative in everything but quality is quality and like so many animated movies they throw out there it has very little 
from the creators of shrek ok that grabbed my attention well the creators of shrek also made madagascar madagascar was half as good as shrek and now flushed away is half as good as madagascar that means flushed away isn t good the animation and all that special effects were extremely good but the movie wasn t the story of this movie was only meant for kids it s seriously not possible for adults to actually love this flick but there were many jokes meant for adults i bet kids dint understand the jokes despite that i dint like this flick i am completely disappointed 
so don t even think about renting this from the shops because this is one hell of a bad movie you d think that jj abrahams had written this movie basically a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out fans of the completely terrible shrek might enjoy but wallace gromit fans will probably turn away in disgust also why didn t they do it in plasticine or clay i mean cgi animation for an aardman movie obviously aardman lazed around while they let dreamworks do the whole thing wrong wrong wrong nearly every single character is awful apart from that freaky frog guy who is just right for a movie villain but everything else about the movie is dull dull dull i almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie no wait actually i did fall asleep with boredom watching this movie it s just terrible but thankfully it s not as bad as shrek 
let s just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand this is a very dumb film with an even dumber script lame animation and a story that s about as original as thumbtacks don t bother unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children they might laugh especially if they re off their meds there s a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort but they don t even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing this film frankly ticked me off royally shame on you for stooping so low 
can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar i mean really animation looked antiquated by standards and even by toy story standards or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman whatever their reasoning the story truly did suck somehow hugh jackman is a rat a rat that is flushed down a toilet yeah i know seems stereotypical but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london to an extent throw in a promise of jewels and an evil frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment i would like to say something entertained me maybe the hookup in the movie or maybe the happily ever after rat relationship but nothing did it had the talent but it blew up d 
this and immoral tales both left a bad taste in my mouth it seems to me that borowczyk is disgusted by sex and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex as a film it s not very well done some of the acting is truly epically bad such as the american woman with the french accent the young woman s sudden flip flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested when it seems like it should have been the other way around and the aunt s sudden realization of the young man s secret don t make sense they re not explained at all i also didn t like how the daughter s relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family s perversion or predilection for bestiality the central idea the idea that there s this sexy beast if you will that lives in the woods could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty sex negative morality play 
kirsten dunst is terribly overrated as an actress you can tell always she s just acting i like izzard though plot is awfully boring the viewer has no real connections to the characters never knowing who to really sympathize with or even care about slow dull movie with some laughs but few and not very funny anyway plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least you can see each plot turn coming a mile away what is this movie supposed to be comedy drama who cares you won t by the end of this film 
after seeing this film i complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty for at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background s music and the scratchiness of the sound track i was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so it was the director i was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film the music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film these days directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique unfortunately no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same so apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film which you can find out for yourself elsewhere the sound track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss you will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound track and certainly not a cat s meow 
i am appalled at how bad this film is as a pastiche of early th century hollywood artistes it sets a new low even past the moderns or gasp cradle will rock i never thought i d see a film worse than those granted they were about a slightly different milieu period nevertheless the intents results were distressingly similar first off there s the horrible casting eddie izzard as chaplin excuse me peter did you owe this guy something jennifer tilly as loulla parsons kirsten dunst as marion davies holy smoke these people don t even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting well last picture show was a decent film but this thing is a disaster the rest of bogdonovitch s pics haven t been much better guess rubbing up against welles hitch ford wore off a long time ago still good for hosting tcm though 
what is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is in fact a head ache inducing tale about a bunch of characters the only big actor being ginger rogers in a very early role all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building these characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean as a cheap low budget production most of the action revolves around rogers and her lead man some guy i don t care who he is cause he really sucked talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt honestly i ve never had a worse time watching an old b rate movie of this type and i ve seen some real head slappers oh and the butler didn t do it because there wasn t a butler but pay attention to the guy who s closest to a butler there ya go polarisdib
a very young ginger rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter lyle talbot in this murder mystery from poverty row film maker allied productions the movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house or was it from a lover s apartment rogers actually has two identities at the film s outset that of miss terry the dead victim s secretary along with her newspaper byline of pat morgan mistakenly phoning her story directly to ted rand talbot instead of her paper s rewrite desk she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he s been out scooped here s a puzzle it s revealed during police inspector russell s purnell pratt investigation of harker s death that terry morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks why exactly was that after the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story but before clues are dropped regarding harker s association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building but again that association isn t relevant until it s all linked up to janitor peterson harvey clark and who s making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a hsss with the words you will hear it cut and pasted beneath apparently the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment house s radiator system which peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims such as mrs coby in the apartment below harker but in answer to a question posed to inspector russell about mrs coby s death he replied apparently to the cause of strangulation it s these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me the revelation of janitor peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of miss morgan in the building s incinerator furnace however and score another point against continuity we see miss morgan in a huge basement room as peterson ignites the furnace she made her getaway but how and still pretty as a picture and who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant wilfred arthur hoyt who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room sorry but for all those reviewers who found a shriek in the night to be a satisfying whodunit i feel that any charlie chan film of the same era is a veritable the usual suspects by comparison if you need a reason to see the film it would be ginger rogers but be advised she doesn t dance 
this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron the acting is second rate poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film and god help gina gershon her accent is too over the top it sounds nothing like an true english woman it sounds forced and phony much like her acting she should stick to what she does best lesbian showgirl con artist who plays in a rock roll band and has a drug problem the other characters are no better they are two dimensional empty vapid and silly how are we to supposed to care about these people at one point christy scott cashman get s lost in central park really it s not that hard to navigate central park just follow any path out not only did i not care about any of the characters i downright hated them the only reason i even stayed with this train wreck of a film was fisher stevens even his brilliant humor couldn t save this dying fish each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us the script was awful as was the acting if you catch this fish throw it back 
worst movie ever made please see the real movie reviews from the pros on this movie check rotten tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film the comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film i find the positive comments very misleading i find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an academy awards speech don t waste your hard earned money this film is retarded i can t believe a film like this would ever be made why would hollywood waste their time on such junk this film is an attempt at nothing i ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash i went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money i didn t listen and i did waste my time and cash please don t make the same mistake it really is the worst movie ever made 
the only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its message spoiler they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions they blame bears and deer for misbehaving by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger 
mmm doesn t a big stack of pancakes sound good maple syrup and fruit preserves on top take a bite mmmmmmm take another bite another another eat eat it you keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea you have just had the ally mcbeal experience i stumbled on this show in the winter of and was instantly hooked like that stack of pancakes i gorged myself on it but the enjoyment soon wore off because the ally mcbeal character whom we see to be cute endearing at first sight soon becomes the most annoying insecure whining complainer you ve ever met call me a feminist but i prefer my female leads to have a spine the gags gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed the music of vonda shepherd which is really shoved in your face becomes grating and the incessant character changes rewrites make the show into a damn soap opera my advice to you is to take this show in small doses and quit as soon as it becomes bothersome and it will i made it through seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured it was good while it lasted but like a crazy neurotic ex girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had overstayed its welcome and next time you go to ihop skip the pancakes order something healthy like the fruit cup it ll sit with you much better 
i think this is almost all i need to say i feel obliged to explain my actions though i ve basically never seen such an armature production and i mean that in all senses of the word although he physical camera work boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areas unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying characters it s a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like haiku tunnel there s a other indie films that died silent deaths i don t know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution i m quite bemused as to why they picked this up the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title however the reason for that is even a let down i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it i ve seen a lot of films in my time and i m very forgiving when in the cinema but this was too much i ll never forget tunnel for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema shame it s such a low point 
really when it comes down to it this movie is just not funny josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny and yet he thinks he s hilarious the plot about mailing the letters was fine at first until josh s look at me i m wacky approach began infesting each and every scene the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been privy to and that is saying quite a bit since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie and as for the incredible overuse of the pixies debaser i have just one thing to say what did the pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to write direct produce star in such a terrible movie 
my wife and i rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and office space blockbuster and imdb even had it as an also recommended selection if you liked office space now i ve seen office space probably or times i love it it s probably one of my favorite movies witty humorous and featuring characters that remind me of people i ve worked with over the years haiku tunnel is similar to office space in that they are both films that s where the similarity ends we sat through probably the first minutes of ht giving it the benefit of the doubt hoping nay praying that it would get better it didn t we couldn t take it any more and stopped the tape thank god it was a free rental i d have been p ed if we d actually paid for it we should be reimbursed for having to sit through it now since we didn t see the end perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself i doubt it haiku tunnel is so bad it s hard to believe it ever got produced the movie is so unfunny it s painful just mail the friggin letters already the premise is asinine the jokes are awful we got as far as the printer doesn t work scene and had to stop we couldn t take it anymore this film is an embarrasment for josh kornbluth if you are a fan of office space don t waste your time with this turd 
office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and `temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as `clockwatchers and `office space and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however `haiku tunnel directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to it s predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of `san franc l isco it s an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn t all that funny kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a `temp it s a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go `perm the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he s nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he s typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he s been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that `something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are `important letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesn t take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluth s days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says `if you play it straight they will laugh but they didn t and the audience won t because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case `plays funny as in he `knows he s being funny he never is and that s exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being `funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn t work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily `bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it s easy to understand why this one just doesn t fly the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth s performance if only momentarily but it s still not enough to save the day or the film the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question `what was he thinking when he agreed to this in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone s comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right `haiku tunnel however will doubtfully remain very long amongst them for it s destiny lies elsewhere in a realm known only as `obscurity i rate this one 
this movie is nothing like office space except in the premise office space was hilarious i would not recommend this movie to anyone as i laughed not once during the entire film mr cornbluth s self indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than jason alexanders in the same room if you decide to see this movie use a free rental or watch it at someone else s house so you can leave if necessary 
i ll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona because quite frankly to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth is just an insult to any such director i will also avoid mentioning the spot on satire `office space in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe i can however compare it to waking up during your own surgery it s painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they re doing haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish they d pulled the plug on in its early stages of production it was cruel to let it live and as a result audiences around the world are being made to suffer the film s premise if indeed it has one is not even worth discussing but for the sake of caution i will josh kornbluth a temp worker with severe commitment phobia is offered a permanent job his main duty is to mail out high priority letters for his boss but ludicrously he is unable to perform this simple task my reaction big deal that s not a story it s a passing thought at best one that should ve passed any self respecting filmmaker by the leading actor if you can call him that is a clumsy buffoon of a man with chubby features a receding untamed hairline and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe making to plain disturbing where o where did the director find this schmuck what s that you say he is the director oh my mistake playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing but i suspect that mr kornbluth isn t that convincing as a human being let alone an actor rest assured this is by no means an aimless character assassination but never before have i been so riled up by an actor s on screen presence my frustration was further confounded by his incessant to camera monologues in between scenes i mean as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel kornbluth insults us further by `explaining the action first rule of filmmaking `dramatize exposition show don t tell who does this guy think he is he has no charisma no charm and judging by his hawaiian shirts no sense of style his casting agent should be shot point blank the supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom i felt with but one exception patricia scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as helen the ex secretary who has been driven insane by her old boss and makes harassing phone calls from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face this did make me chuckle to myself but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film the film s title is also a misnomer haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry don t be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office there s a very good reason for that 
to make any film about the supposed end of the world there should be some facts realism we are never told why these people believe this location is new years eve in toronto canada so please some one tell me why was then still shining at midnight why based on the costumes did it seem like september the acting was in that neo au natural style that needed a director who knew how to do it the individual story pieces were all dreary without any purpose i could go on but i do not want to make this as boring as the film rating out of on imdb scale thank you i am as always jay harris aka sirbossman
kurosawa really blew it on this one every genius is allowed a failure the concept is fine but the execution is badly blurred there is an air of fantasy about this film making it something of an art film the poverty stricken of tokyo deserve a fairer and more realistic portrayal many of them have interesting stories to tell a very disappointing film 
from the first time i saw the box cover of the movie and the stretched out photography i thought this guy this friend of the scwarz must be like foot or ft in not feet tall not that it s his fault at any rating i turned on the movie one cool night in tucson out on the second story deck with a good cigar and let it roll at that time my wife was having an affair and things were going down hill for me so i needed a good diversion but as bad as the movie was i totally enjoyed it with a bottle of merlot too i might admit truly i have watched this movie many times it always makes me feel good it s not that it tries too hard to be cool or that it s so close to hitting the mark for an action film it s frantic and then truly clueless then frantic again it s the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene wow i never felt safer in my life warm and happy too i was thankful that they conserved on the gasoline during the chase due to less production in the summer months anywho the direction was uninspired the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed or re choreographed and tightened up the sound was off the delivery didn t hit you it just kept on going the other way the locals of that village that they were in the town rather were off cue they also did not seem to follow what was happening very well the would look and even stare into the camera lens like a deer in the head lights kind of thing only some of them with a smile a smiling deer i feel bad because columbu i just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in america as well as for his own countrymen however baretta s island is very lethargic and unbelievable even still i like it a lot my now x wife hates it but i love it the funny thing is i am pretty discriminating when it comes to movies i like or even love all in all i like franco so there it is as a movie adding addendum to this if you like killing a few hours with truly fun to watch straight to video b movies or bad movies for your little library collection then if you can find it check out the big sweat with robert z dar you know the big guy from tango cash the big sweat a bomb of a cop story with no real plot discovery and acting that is so lame it might as well be on crutches and at the end of the big sweat i think they ran out of money because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and let it burn during the credits good fun but all in all not as good as baretta s island i gave it a and an overall rating of awful for awful good b movie i m waiting for the sequel maybe like baretta s revenge on montazuma franco takes a mexican vacation and gets sick on the water then declares war on the water co or baretta s powder war where as he would stake out a large drug lord in his country and chemically gene splice and create a hybrid super bug insect that would be bred and dropped into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and upon passing it through the bug it forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke to pure powdered sugar then another sequel he would have to get the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on he could get a major tooth paste company to endorse and partially fund the project with careful product placement in the feature right 
william lustig s followup to maniac proves conclusively that without tom savini s spectacular effects and spinell s convincing performance maniac would never have become the cult hit that it did vigilante is badly directed with a simple minded script that spells everything out for you and is predictable at every turn and also mediocre performances by all the actors judging from the sense of deja vu this film gave me lustig had watched death wish several times too many before making this 
this is said to be a personal film for peter bogdonavitch he based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters who are detectives these detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective doesn t it this entire movie was written by peter and it shows how out of touch with real people he was you re supposed to write what you know and he did that indeed and leaves the audience bored and confused and jealous for that matter this is a curio for people who want to see dorothy stratten who was murdered right after filming but patti hanson who would in real life marry keith richards was also a model like stratten but is a lot better and has a more ample part in fact stratten s part seemed forced added she doesn t have a lot to do with the story which is pretty convoluted to begin with all in all every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with unless you re millionaire from manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call for the rest of us it s an irritating snore fest that s what happens when you re out of touch you entertain your few friends with inside jokes and bore all the rest 
the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture the land of plenty seals the coffin i m afraid by being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental and clich d film the characters are entirely flat and stereotyped the writing plot and direction are amateurish at best for the first time in quite a while i was impatient for the film to end so i could get on with my life the war torn delirium of the uncle the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen what happened the days of experimentation perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him i m afraid let s hope he finds his inspiration again at the toronto film festival which is where i saw the film wenders was there to introduce it completely lacking in humility he offered us the following i hope no wait i know you re going to enjoy the next two hours i m afraid he couldn t be more wrong 
watching der himmel ber berlin as a teen in the late s was a profound experience for me so this was what the movies could be along with paris texas and until the end of the world it still holds a special place in my heart and mind a testament to the genius of wim wenders unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with million dollar hotel and land of plenty hitting a terrible low point gone are the captivating pictures or music no search for or display of great insight all that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements that boils down to nothing but clich s and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience has the well run dry whatever the reason it s time for mr wenders to either step it up or stop altogether 
i get it the diehl character is s posed to be a microcosm of america itself seeing arab terrorists under every rock only to find out at the end that it s his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops sorry wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well made amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters dialog and plotting better luck on your next flick another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of la being there for reasons of hunger these people don t get enough to eat truly these folks aren t eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger an emotional hunger a mental hunger they need self respect self worth dignity which you can t give a man yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available less the center for hunger in america i would say it s more the center for alcoholism drug abuse mental suffering and economic devastation dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age old human problem of homelessness bill diehl was good though and michelle williams was cute as the young yet cliched old soul 
a good idea badly implemented while that could summarize of the scifi channel s movies it really applies here i love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and i like action movies and i like all of the main actors so this could have been great however despite some good acting this movie fails due to bill platt s bad writing and directing another review made the good point of needing to know where you re going so you can get there this movie doesn t it s put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words second draft are not in bill platt s vocabulary there is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing this scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle this movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front it also had a habit of aborting a fight early probably just because they couldn t afford it there are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive seriously what is that if you are a fan of shiri appleby watch this movie because she s ok she does manage to break out of her roswell persona a few times and make for a good tough chick but not always john de lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he s ever done since playing q back in st tng so that s nothing new in all i gave this movie a rating 
shiri appleby is the cutest little embodiment of evil turned good girl demon kicking buffy clone elle but i m getting ahead of myself you see lilith was the first woman made by god as a companion to adam but she got all uppity evil feminist so god banished her from eden a clandestine order known as the fath captures her but doesn t kill her so now with amnesia which is not really explained that well lilith now elle is free to become the aforementioned buffy clone who has to battle with a mad scientist who got an injection of lilith s blood if the previous paragraph sounded hideously convoluted that s because it is the movie is also dull generic and for a film with a plot steeped in theology it doesn t seem to know a lick about it this bargain basement lousy cgied movie was apparently a failed series pilot all i can say to the fact that it didn t get picked up is a resounding amen my grade d dvd extras commentary by writer director bill platt and co writer chris regina and stills gallery video effects samples before after it also has an also available selection that you would think would lead you to some trailers but nope on dvd covers for other films which is a stupid idea dvd rom extras final shooting script and deleted scenes transcript both in pdf format
this obvious pilot for an unproduced tv series features young canadian actress shiri appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man turned flying demon is let loose on the world the cgi is par for a tv job and appleby is ok as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine familiar tv face richard burgi is along for the ride as appleby s mentor but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level we see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start a bad sign also the scenes where burgi is training appleby for battle are actually laughable they are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies most notably remo williams 
this seemed to be a good movie i thought it would be a good movie and throughout the movie i was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time and yes i have to admit that the acting talent of dimple kapadia and deepti naval where truly commendable but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message which it seems is it seemed was what somnath sen is trying to do the final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied if indeed that was the director s intention this falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo typing of the american characters they all seem to be carved out of the same block seems to me that most american characters in indian english movies are based upon how common indians themselves perceive americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any american in the movie these two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story 
oscar wilde s comedy of manners perhaps the wittiest play ever written is all but wrecked at the hands of a second rate cast sanders is as one would expect casually indolently brilliant in the role of lord darlington but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time jean crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy indeed the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy doubtless the hays office insisted preminger s direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by lubitsch or even the screen version with helen hunt as mrs erlynne or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words but skip this version 
i can sum this movie up using words or less way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face see words however i didn t completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that julie bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the dvd right out from the machine and blowing it up with an m my advice take the rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck or you may want to send me the replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice 
some illegal so called asylum seeker comes to stuttgart and finds that germans are racist this is just another already forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post wwii anti german propaganda films aimed to make germans feel bad for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase german blonds and sell drugs to german teenagers if you re looking for good german films in general see der tunnel der untergang europa europa and lola rennt but not this also das experiment with the same male actor from lola rennt 
an illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing dire consequences for many well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion the feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed the little person lost in the big society is something to which we can all relate but i cannot endorse going out of your way to see this movie 
i had watched the eye before i watched this one i really liked the eye it was one of the best movies of the recent asian horror cinema so i picked this bangkok haunted because it was the same director and it was kind of popular round here but man what a disappointment bangkok haunted are three stories about love revenge ghosts etc that are no scary at all not even disturbing as the eye was no nothing i can t even fill the lines required for the comment boring my rate 
times are tough for angel town gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown mainly due to embarrassing writing the gangs want a street kid martine to join the gangs so they beat him up everyday however due to the presence of an olympic kick boxer olivier world s lamest actor gruner named jacques hope is on the way angel town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made and i ve seen my share it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need are french kick boxers who can t act worst of all there are so many awkward moments it s just truly hilarious best of all comes from the exchange between gruner and aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is to wit you like the fighting olivier grabs his asian best friend in a headlock i could kill him right when i want him dead he dies the reason why i don t want him dead is because i m afraid of him and i know that if i kill him his son and wife will kill me that s why he doesn t die of course the fact that it s wrong to kill someone let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation odd however don t let me make this sound that i hated this movie far from it it s so terrible it s priceless the biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees grunner going one on one with gang members who the film s biggest logic gap decline the use of pistols also a handicapped vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs while gruner kick boxes the rest all of this set to the sound of horrible mexican accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this the other treat about this movie is that for some reason olivier gruner never attends college despite that s the main reason he s here in the states and not in france getting it on with his girlfriend in a graveyard in the film s awkward beginning angel town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level this is the perfect movie for you on the other hand make sure to down tequila like the laughable opening song details ain t no mercy in angel town out of bad 
olivier gruner stars as jacques a foreign exchange college student who takes on and single handedly wipes out a mexican street gang in this obnoxious and racist film which is so horrible that it s laughable bad acting bad plot and bad fight choreography make angel town a turkey 
oliver gruner is totally unknown to me my friend showed me this film because he had seen gruner in what he called a pretty good sci fi film nemesis so as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through the bs drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences gruner loves to kick and kick and kick and kick haha gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in he finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family instead of joining up gruner tells the boy to fight back against a gang too crazy gruner plays a typical van damme character who kills everyone or maims them pretty bad and works to rid his block of these gangmembers the plot was very cheesy and easy to think of gruner is probably not very well known because of his script choosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to this ghetto is pure hell and i enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against gruner s character the music was typical action music thumping pianos and timpani swelling guitars which actually wasn t as bad as i make it sound the director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every minutes for a tense family moment ultimately i gave it a because it really tried to be an average action film for oliver gruner to star in but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw 
my kid makes better videos than this i feel ripped off of the spent renting this thing there is no date on the video case apparently designed by wellspring and what s even worse there s no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie the only date given is leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he s getting a recent film this movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made that i m amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video it might be of interest to students studying the counter culture of the s the anti war anti establishment tune in turn on and drop out culture but when you read the back of the video case there s no hint that that is what you re getting if you do make the mistake of renting it though it is probably best viewed while on drugs so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors fassbinder and fengler regardless of your state of mind while watching it i can tell you that it doesn t get any better after the first scene so knowing that i m sure you ll be fast asleep long before the end 
billy chung siu hung s the bloody swordplay film assassin from film love to kill hong kong is among the strongest products of the category iii boom that inhabited the hk cinema in early nineties it consisted of films with strong sex nudity and violence more or less gratuitous and shock valued only love to kill definitely belongs to the more category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sickness the hk psycho anthony wong from the award winning the untold story by herman yau from the same year plays a business man and a husband who likes to torture humiliate and rape his young wife elizabeth lee mei fung who for some reason doesn t leave him and save herself and their little son from the disturbed tormentor a policeman danny lee the famous police character actor from films like dr lamb by billy tang and co directed by lee and the killer by john woo to name just a few however sees the problem and starts to protect the wife and the son but anthony naturally doesn t like this at all and leads it all into the typical ultra mean spirited and graphic finale during a rain storm the film is almost completely without any serious merits as it s just a piece of exploitation in order to cash in when these kind of films were so popular the imagery and happenings are something never found in the western cinema at least in mainstream and it all becomes even more mind blowing when some most taboos for westerners like violence and perversions witnessed by a child are broken in these films so often that reading the plotlines alone would make most viewers feel sick and that goes perfectly especially for this film too the film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned dr lamb which practically started the whole boom in usually the music and soundtrack in hk films is interesting and adds to the imagery especially in these terror films also the cinematography is worth mentioning as the film bathes especially in the finale in blue colors and camera lenses as does assassin too and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera otherwise there s nothing that would rate the film any higher other than on the nastiness meter the actors and actresses are talented and professional and so don t make the film any worse with their acting still the film has the usual hk humor in it which makes the sick goings on even sicker as some humor is thrown into the soup that includes some jokes about danny lee s erection and so on something that could never be found in the western serious films either and that thing usually destroys mane otherwise noteworthy hk films as the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audience and masses the film has a very high outrageousness level as it has numerous scenes depicting the abuse of wong s wife in various ways she gets raped and molested beaten and kicked by her husband we also get to see some flashbacks from wong s own childhood which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now these flashback scenes mostly at the end of the film include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is speeded up for example the hits of an axe and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene again something that only hk exploitation makers seem to be able to come up with the ending itself includes plenty of sudden and shocking gore as the madman wields his axe and meets also some nails for example on his furious way the film is also genuinely pretty suspicious in my opinion as the violence and terror is realistically painful and deals with things that should never be taken as entertainment mostly i mean rape the version i saw i ve seen two versions includes a very long and completely nauseating rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible i m not sure does the hk audience really like imagery like this but i think no one with some sense for morality in films entertainment would never accept or make something like it women get brutalized and killed in the most sadistic and low ways so that the fates of the men seem almost tame when compared to the females the other version i saw the newly released dvd in hk without subtitles has this table brutality scene in a much longer form than the subtitled taiwanese dvd which is otherwise identical to the hk version i ve also heard that the old hk laserdisc is different from these two and since the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the actual film it is impossible to say how uncut versions these that have been released or shown theatrically are obviously plenty of footage has been cut out possibly even before the theatrical release the film is written by law gam fai and lau wing kin the former having written also films like dr lamb the untold story and gunmen kirk wong but out of his other films that i ve seen love to kill is the most gratuitous dr lamb and the untold story both are very brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some criticism towards the authorities and men in general as how it is easy to turn into a beast when chasing or fighting one the harrowing torture imagery of the untold story the victim being the criminal is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in the society and among the police for example but there s none of this in love to kill it is just honest calculated and fastly made exploitation which is by the way produced by a veteran director kirk organized crime triad bureau crime story wong love to kill earns no more than from me as i don t have too high appreciation on films like this hk cinema is meant to be and can be more and films like love to kill are only commercial parasites living among the real pieces of the art 
this movie is really wack there is really nothing nice i can say about it besides the moral truth expressed in the film s climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime besides all that the film had nothing no good shots no good acting and no good script i give this film a f and a out 
you know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie well this was beyond that i bought the dvd at tower records because it was like and i d heard this was a movie you could laugh at it is really nothing short of pathetic about minutes into the movie my friends started asking me to turn it off around minutes they begged me after an hour we compromised to fast forward to the end so we could see how the conflict was resolved and because we had been watching the whole time for matt walsh seriously don t watch this movie it is beyond painful 
well i d be lying if i said that this could easily rival spiderman or the batman movies still it was more appealing to me for it s moral value i first bought the vhs when my son was about years old and it immediately became his favorite my wife and i are avid supporters of robert townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie hollywood shuffle true he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable but his movies are still fun meteor man provides a hero with an urban contemporary feel i always felt that if there were superheroes they wouldn t provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics meteor man is realistic hero with real problems car broken into bad neighborhood local drug dealing gangs using children for distribution etc the scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community what i found to be truly entertaining outside of james earl jones young forever performance was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers it wasn t long before they had a full agenda lined up for him without his input of course it was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived yes the plot was weak the movie was predictable there was bad acting and continuity was rotten but it ranks with my kids robert townsend works to bring movies home so to speak i doubt he ll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor producer director he truly is but there are and will always be those that love him for his efforts one point to ponder about the film which i find amusing throughout the entire battle with simon no one bothered to call the police also what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window my mother would have been right there scrapping by my side toe to toe dad would be loading his pistol lol rent it and check it out it s worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of sinbad luther vandross bill cosby big daddy kane etc great job with the cameos robert 
while it does crack the odd good joke the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes unlike what an other comment says i don t think this is the best rte have ever made its really dry and sarcastic sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren t really that good overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre its not as good as jasper carrot or dave allens stuff i find benny hill funnier 
absolutely one of the worst movies i ve seen in a long time it starts off badly and just deteriorates katherine heigl is woefully miscast in a lolita role and leo grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character the only cast member with any enthusiasm is tom sizemore who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role the script is dire the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double decker bus through it is also the most sexist movie i have ever seen katherine heigl s character is completely unsympathetic she s seen as an evil wanton seductress who lures the poor innocent married man to cheat on his wife it is implied throughout the movie that she s underage and the message that accompanies that plot strand just beggars belief at the end she isn t even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who s obviously ha become demented with rage and guilt but the script allows him to kill himself thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere horrible don t waste your time 
i rented this film thinking it was the sobbingly sad version i saw as a kid it was not i was therefore very disappointed with what i felt was marginal acting poor character development and most of all failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog in this version the dog of flanders is just a cute aside to the movie get the version 
people love the original story for its ending the hollywood style ending made this version of a dog of flanders just for kids movie i didn t cry this time because the story was too hollywood japanese tv series are much better 
 the running jumping standing still film is not a film as such but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme this film got richard lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first beatles film a hard day s night richard lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in this film was entitled the running jumping standing still film it was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production since the film was intended to be viewed by lester and his partners alone a small amount of money and time was invested the sole purpose of this film is entertainment but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera the film cost to make and it was filmed in sepia toned film stock in a field on a couple of sundays all of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production the finished production is eleven minutes in length the running jumping standing still film is a comedy about english sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time all of the events in this film take place in a field a few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record a photographer developing film in a pond an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model s face a man building a tent an athlete running over the tent and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away but it also pokes fun at english culture when compared to american culture another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite which has been constructed out of the flag of the united kingdom one of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it and the kite breaks according to neil sinyard author of the films of richard lester this event symbolizes the united kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the united states during the space age according to this scene the british fly primitive kites while the americans the world power after world war ii fly highly advanced rockets and space shuttles 
this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen it is not funny it is not interesting and should not have been made 
his first movie after longtime friend john belushi s death aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for belushi instead doctor detroit gives us bookish professor aykroyd masquerading as a weird violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as mom that s bad enough but he also has classes to teach a school dinner to host four ladies of the evening to protect and a pimp s dinner or something like that to attend no wonder aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time why should the viewer be alone it was on this film that aykroyd met future wife donna dixon at least some good came out of this chaotic mess one and a half stars you want good aykroyd see the blues brothers you want bad see doctor detroit 
you know those films that have you trapped in the cinema you re stuck there in the best seat in the house centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat and after about what feels like hours you are still trapped there uncomfortable and itchy thinking when the f is this film ever going to end you know the feeling think of a i and the village well visitor q delivers a weird variant of that feeling i sat there for the first minutes wondering when the thing was going to f ing start it is interminable so arty it hurts this is the first miike takashi film i have watched apparently he makes films by the dozen and if they are all pretentious w nk like this i suspect it will be the last i m not against pretentious w nk david lynch is up there amongst the top directors for me but visitor q is cut rate cheap and nasty pretentious w nk as you may have worked out by now i hated it 
this movie was terrible throughout the whole movie i was puzzled and did not see any point to it i had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about this movie is not worth watching at all not only is it sick and revolting but totally stupid please don t watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies if this movie questions japanese society and their values and roles than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know this is a totally sick movie i did not enjoy it because it made no sense my boyfriend and i sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under it was total disappointment 
this movie stinks i don t think i have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value the plot was relatively interesting but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland this could have been an a good movie i think it just relied on it s grotesque visuals i can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos but it felt like miike shot it for the sake of shooting it just one poorly executed film there just isn t anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest pedophilia necrophilia rape self milking parental and sibling abuse and fecal dispersement i think i just sold the film to many of you but i meant it when i said this stinks he has succeeded in other films but i think you d be better off watching someone pooping 
there is nothing cool hip or clever about this film liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema how can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean ugly people are serial killers if they have to dismember total strangers in order to be a family again then we don t want them to be a family what part of that did you have trouble grasping why applaud this filth this silly filth is what you do if you can t do art one s head life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as interesting this is a camera without a brain what really makes an artwork cool is profundity questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history or in this case a knowledge of anything would be preferable instead this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as cool cause it s so far out man these same violent events actually happen every day they are not just in the film they refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to you do you want those things done to you a child could have thought this up it required zero imagination it is not surrealism this lazy crap has no content is saying nothing it s just the worst of the evening news it is saying nothing new nothing we don t already know it s the emperor s new clothes the director hoping there are enough uneducated children proud of their streak of inhumanity for this sloppy filth to fly i can see director miike s demented fans now chain smoking teens and twenties drunks covered in tattoos with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces their knowledge base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves there is no plot to this it is just sheer exploitation of shock value violence there is no hidden meaning anywhere in this poorly made film it is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic but you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not there to do that you need to view review a real piece of cinema there are plenty out there directed by fellini bergman fassbinder herzog altman bunuel kurosawa lynch tarkovsky peter greenaway tarantino guillermo del toro richard linklater eisenstein aronofsky gus van sant soderbergh shyamalan ordet why don t you view a real art film by the likes of these giants this wannabe director miike will never make a film equal to one of the geniuses i just listed because he just doesn t have the talent anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like visitor q teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon there s no message no meaning no plot nothing to it at all there are long lists of art films to learn from but this visitor q is not an art film in any respect it has no content to it it s just one banal horror piled onto another and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things happen every single day somewhere in the world they are not okay because they are just in the film they refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to you do you want those things done to you to others why because this world is already ugly enough thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this there are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap there is no deeper meaning there is nothing to analyze why keep trying i ve spent nearly years watching practically every film ever made and keeping up with all the new ones but i ve never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this it s not imaginative or even shocking because these types of events happen daily all over the world to make this film or even to favorably review it has caused over young airheads who don t know any better to think it s cool they may grow up thinking that convincing others some of whom may end up doing these things convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity trust me on this i know cool and cool this piece of crap ain t visitor q has the feel of a genuine snuff film and i m still not sure it isn t actually your actions have consequences son the world is awful enough already some violence like this could happen to you or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this fake art film believe me you won t be thinking it s cool when someone is sawing your skull in half 
okay so i get it we re supposed to be horrified the idea has been planted a girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it call me over the shock rock genre but i call for the explicit detailing of an act before i can fall for this but don t expect me to watch a soft porn and become horrified that she is doing her father i mean hasn t that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with rape and molestation porn horror isn t what your mind can fool you into believing it is what actually exists in film this is where miike fails in visitor q extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure 
i actually retired from asian horror films some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing samey ghost story rubbish however i ve been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently and so decided to give them another chance my first port of call was highly rated director takashi miike s highly rated visitor q i d already seen audition and while i didn t like it much i do rate it as one of the better modern asian horror films so i went into this with sensible expectations and unfortunately found only boredom i suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them any comparisons to the work of luis bunuel and david lynch is blasphemous as far as i m concerned all miike has done here is make a film any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by pretentious fans desperate to find some kind of meaning my headache set in about minutes in after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason and it didn t subside until the movie finally ended at least twenty four hours later or so it would seem don t get me wrong i m not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around but while this may be violent it s also pointless and boring and i didn t get one ounce of enjoyment out of it takashi miike may have a lot of fans but i m certainly not one of them and i certainly hope this is the last time i ll come into contact with one of his films 
anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined we have the submissive heroin addicted part time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son now she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor the release so gained somehow akin to helen keller placing her hands in running water we have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter she s upset with him because he came too quickly and ends by murdering his female colleague having sex with her corpse and then chopping her up we have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom you see it s all circular deep huh the only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son s tormentors it s a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be if that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious no wonder most people think artists are insane we saw this lousy movie then put on zero woman the accused oh my god it was a tossup as to which one was worse what is going on in japan these days sick sick sick 
 big spoilers i ve seen one other takashi miike film and that was the very disturbing and brutal audition which was an examination of the japanese ideals of femininity in visitor q which i think means visitor question he examines in a very disturbingly gross way the family unit miike s surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be lynchian in terms of confusion and film making but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue we the audience are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure kenichi endo who was actually quite good paying for sex with his displaced daughter fujiko then as the father returns home he is struck on the head by the visitor kazushi watanabe wielding a fairly sizeable rock and for some reason they both end up back at the family home the mother shungiku uchida is beaten and bullied by her son jun muto who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers when the visitor enters the home he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit eventually the family begin to improve their relationship with assistance from the visitor through milking breasts murder and retaining a sense of family pride and there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together it s has uncomfortable humour but is equally frustratingly silly and over the top in its weirdness there is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses partly because of the situation itself and partly because you can t believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this the style of the film is poor to say the least and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak the characters themselves are all over the place and while i understand this is not meant to be realistic there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd the camera work is sloppy and doesn t have that cinematic feel that lynch s work entails it s hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in japan it just seems that miike was out to shock and the film seems self aware that it s trying to be shocking and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously all in all i would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy but it looks and feels amateurish and seems to unnecessarily want to shock miike s previous film audition was finely balanced between disgusting horror character development and technique which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot visitor q is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting without really having much to say in the process out of 
i like billy crystal and i thought it would be fun to watch this film since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together i thought i had seen all billy s movies but couldn t remember this one and now i know why it s so full of clich s and phony emotion you can smell each scene coming and going billy doesn t even get to be funny very often he s too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down alan king himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc etc or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la and when the end comes boy does it come quickly almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor 
considering the risk of showing same sex relationships before the late s personal best could have done better to play the same sex relationship between hemingway chris cahill and donnelly tory skinner as a more than experimental phase of cahill s life it seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers also consider the seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole this random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie i suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie the oregon track and field competition this review may seem harsh but it is the truth the exploitation of young muriel hemingway s body and the same sex relationship ruined any credit that i would have given to this film pepper thompson
this is just typical bruce willis action movie schtick watch it with some popcorn and your buddies rent it to save money none of it is realistic the battles aren t realistic the soldiers aren t realistic the victims aren t realistic and why was tom skerritt s character talking to willis from the deck of the carrier what s up with that he can t do that from inside the ship of course bruce w gets a machete wound there s a bunch of average explosions if this movie accurately represents the navy seals then don t get stuck in africa expecting them to come rescue you the noble attack on the village bothered me the most front row seats to an ethnic cleansing as bruce looks at the slaughter going on in town so what does he do he crawls into town on his belly yep how many died while they were putzing around oh well a body count was needed i guess and if that one african guy was so important why didn t he get on the chopper with the elderly and children can he say duh finally the movie was very dark not just in plot but so much happens at night it was difficult to make out what was going on rent it 
 for the lt to have chosen this one first the film wasn t horrible it was just hollywood worst case i need this to happen or we have no movie scenario if willis mission was to save the doctor but she was adamant that her people make it out of the missionary he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her he would not have compromised his package for the refugees that s not how it works but as i pointed out this is hollywood we must have drama this is why we make movies because reality isn t quite so complicated however i did think that willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry that said there are also some well done battle scenes in the film it s not a waste of time tears of the sun is worth the dvd rental fee check it out on a rainy day and you ll be satisfied 
the first ten minutes of just looking really dictates the direction most of this movie takes lenny ryan merriman is a year old boy living in new york in the s he has a burning desire to see two people have sex who are the best people he has in mind well his own mom and stepfather of course how pleasant unfortunately for lenny he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle s wife lenny s next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex however the wife is quite pregnant and they aren t currently sleeping together then lenny makes a new friend him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls they have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex the problem is it s not done in an innocent charming s sort of way i am no prude by any means but i found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation blowjobs and anal sex that kind of rawness may work in a movie like kids but in this film it just seems perverted gretchen mol is utterly wasted here as hedy a former bra model who becomes the object of lenny s carnal desires jason alexander needs to stay as far away from the director s chair as possible for better or worse was awful and now this what a waste 
this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far among more than french movies i have ever seen terrible screenplay and very medioacre unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless with all that it doesn t matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story one of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people as an audience i don t care what happens to them it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes man i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one a major disappointment for me 
you do realize that you ve been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but you d think that after watching unkempt stink ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting and i m not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable it s just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make shift bio dome sipping frosty mochcinno s with moxy what s the appeal here i don t care about these people or their meandering lives i just don t get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking pay dirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankenstein styled cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full blown schizophrenia kicks into gear now that s entertainment 
this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel it is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera it s tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style it also borrows from an early cbs game show pioneer beat the clock by inventing situations for its contestants to try overcome then it rewards the winner money if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality this show has elements of several types of successful past programs reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea if your not this entire series is as i say drivel dripping with gravy it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in it is slick well produced so it might last a while yet after all so do re runs of gilligan s island green acres the beverly hillbillies the brady bunch this just doesn t employ professional actors the intelligence level is about the same

victim to dibiase with help from virgil adv dibiase s team rhodes next after an undertaker double axe handle off the top rope but doesn t leave quietly attacking brother love undertaker goes after dusty and gets counted out despite not being the legal man adv dibiase s team almost straight after greg gets caught in a cradle by hart trying to put the figure four leg lock on him and gets pinned it comes down to hart v dibiase and after a few minutes of nice wrestling bret gets his body cross reversed by dibiase for the pin dibiase is the sole survivor at least hart is put to good use the vipers jake the snake roberts superfly jimmy snuka and the rockers v visionaries rick model martel warlord and power and glory after spending some time in the ring marty jannetty gets power slammed by warlord as he comes off the top rope for the pin adv visionaries snuka gets pinned in seconds by martel who reverses his body cross adv visionaries michaels gets caught in the power plex and pinned by roma adv visionaries it is now roberts against four men resembling his survivor series effort two years before despite hitting warlord with the ddt roberts gets counted out chasing after martel the

with it to get disqualified bravo commits career suicide shortly afterwards by allowing hogan to cradle him for the pin adv hulkamaniacs earthquake manages to overcome bossman with two elbow drops for the pin shortly afterwards hogan gets beat down and finally tugboat gets a tag who knew he was there at this point he wrestles for about seconds before getting counted out with earthquake only hogan

booking even though the match was awful santana takes the upset victory as the sole survivor and becomes his last finest hour the egg hatches and it s hector guerrerro in a silly outfit he dances with gene okerlund and gets booed by the crowd while piper and monsoon pretend they are enjoying it match of survival ultimate warrior hulk hogan and tito santana v warlord power and glory rick model

glory s push adv dibiase s team hogan eliminates martel by count out and dibiase with the leg drop for the pin adv hogan s team hogan finally allows warrior into the match who quickly disposes of former nemesis hercules after a splash a very predictable ending to the point of nauseous overall too many matches and too little time obviously had a detrimental effect as the wrestlers were almost waiting on a conveyor belt to be pinned most of the heels were decimated by warrior and hogan which is a poor way to handle a great roster of wrestlers 
yes marie dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running dresler is good never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen i watched this for polly moran whom i ve seen elsewhere here moran is ok just ok as dressler s shrewish friend foe too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion the plot is good hearted bad guys try to rob the townspeople dressler triumphs and all ends well i do wonder about the central plot mechanism bonds this came out during the depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly i however not of that era am vaguely familiar with them they re like stocks only different right it seems odd to build a story about the little man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity 
in childhood friends marie dressler as maggie warren and polly moran as lizzie praskins oversee the wedding of their children anita page as helen and norman foster as john before the celebration ms dressler turns the reigns of her small town bank over to her son mr foster six years later the great depression brings many bank closures and financial insecurity banker foster is able to survive due to mother dressler s wise planning but ms moran is worried about her fortune and loudly demands a complete withdrawal other warren bank customers hear moran s rant and start questioning their own solvency soon the family is in financial crisis dressler s huge critical and financial film hit emma had been released early in the year and mgm had to have wanted to get a new dressler film out as soon as possible dressler s hits reducing and politics were still making a lot of money and dressler had become s us box office star according to the industry standard list compiled by quigley publications prosperity certainly celebrated dressler s status but the production appears uncharacteristically sloppy and rushed the cast does well considering some more care in direction and editing and some retakes would have helped apparently they needed it in theaters for the holidays prosperity sam wood marie dressler polly moran anita page norman foster
marie dressler carries this depression era drama about a kindly bank owner which recently aired on tcm during their april fools comedy month if you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the dressler polly moran team you ll be disappointed as this is really a very downbeat film it s also very poorly made surprisingly so considering it came from mgm leonard smith s bare bones cinematography is strictly from the set up the camera and don t move it school frequently to the detriment of the cast who find themselves delivering lines off screen it s like a pan and scan print before such existed or having their heads cut off the film doesn t even have a credited director underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production overall it s an unsatisfying mess with dressler frequently over emoting and only that bizarre final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart 
ugh another one of those fooled by the cover dvds i expected some kind of action at least with bears cats such on the cover i got nothing bad movie i forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually something would happen no luck now the reason i gave this a is because of the scenery otherwise it sucked the kid was terrible talking to himself although i suppose they couldn t just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump threatening a raccoon munching on worms and what a dumbass kicking a porcupine and he wouldn t be pulling those quills out that easily either they stick like fishhooks at least he fought the bear weakly a couple of times what was up with the flashback thing it made a bad movie even worse i wanted to see a survival movie not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce what else can i say well maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something at least that would have been more exciting people don t waste your time on this one 
in my lit class we ve just finished the book hatchet and this movie is nothing like the book brian never ate worms in the book he didn t know the pilot s name his mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see the man the mother is cheating with doesn t have black hair he has blonde now for the unrealistic parts of the movie a thirteen year old can t punch his fist through a window in one punch and for the acting the kid who played brian was a horrible actor however i do believe that the scenery was impressive though i highly doubt the director even read the book this movie is good if you have not read the book hatchet by gary paulsen but if you have then begin a complaint letter to the director 
i came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better instead of what should be a gripping tense story of a boy s fight for survival in the wilderness it comes off as a national geographic documentary meets columbia sportswear ad the film begins with brian jared rushton preparing for a journey by plane to see his father his mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going away gift what s wrong with a rubik s cube little knowing how badly he will soon need it once in the air the plane s pilot a blink and you ll miss him cameo by ned beatty suffers a fatal heart attack leaving brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake extremely lucky to walk or rather swim away virtually unscathed brian must find shelter food and hope for rescue here is where the main problem with the movie begins by the very nature of brian s solitude jared has very few lines to speak and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene instead he is shown walking around sitting around and so on with only a minimal sense of danger as a result too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents troubled marriage as the source of tension these scenes merely get in the way and don t particularly add much to the story even worse occasionally jared his face covered with mud lets out a primal scream or two which conjures up unfortunate parallels to `predator speaking of unfortunate we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet but it presumably helped keep him warm at night another disappointment is pamela sue martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother both she and the father have very little impact in the movie for instance we are never shown how they react to news of brian s disappearance how they might be organizing rescue attempts and so on this is just one source of tension the film makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before brian embarked on his journey 
amy poehler and rachel dratch are among the funnier women to have been on saturday night live it s unfortunate that they along with tina fey and maya rudolph were on snl during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketch making circa the show has ever had still these two women most especially know what s funny and they know how to write a funny movie you ll notice in the credits of this movie that dratch and director ryan shiraki wrote the story for spring breakdown but who wrote the actual screenplay consisting of dialogue and all the important fill in the blank material that makes a story into a multidimensional movie yep just shiraki just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie and no women apparently wrote the script with him the result is a pretty clich spring break movie that doesn t so much spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as mtv does every year if dratch poehler and even co star parker posey could have contributed their handwriting to the screenplay it would have been far less clich the premise is original being about three thirty something women who were unpopular in high school and apparently college too who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about i say allegedly because you never quite know what fun is to these characters they entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale pro woman anthems like true colors and spend their nights together holding make your own pizza parties even though none of them are especially unattractive the outside world appears to treat them like they are there s a scene where a blind student of poehler s played by poehler s real life husband will arnett asks her out on a date only to touch her face and immediately change his mind if poehler s character is supposed to be unattractive they obviously hired the wrong actress the movie continues to show promise even though we have our doubts about the main characters when posey s boss texas senator kay bee hartmann jane lynch funny as always hires posey to watch over her unpopular college age daughter amber tamblyn playing yet another woman who s attractive in real life but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie while she goes to a laguna beach like vacation spot for spring break poehler and dratch come along they reluctantly get boozed up party like they apparently should have when they were in college and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead by sophie monk sophie monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons unfortunately her movie career is off to a rough start with the abominably unfunny date movie and the disappointing click here she plays a southern belle although her voice sounds like she stole delta burke s voice box she hams it up a little too much trying too hard to play a conniving bitch that she comes off as much like a caricature of spoiled college kids as the rest of the extras spring breakdown was released straight to dvd despite the star power of amy poehler but rightly so because the story is way too clich it may as well have been called national lampoon s spring breakdown and the magazine probably wouldn t have sued for trademark infringement because of the free publicity if director shiraki had given at least one woman the creative input especially rachel dratch this movie would have been great and not nearly as run of the mill as frat house comedies we ve seen before i know dratch will come up with another funny concept and hopefully be allowed to fill in the rest of the screenplay herself she s funny enough and she deserves better than this half baked comedy that would accept stiffler s brother with open arms 
i wish i could give this movie a zero cheesy effects and acting the only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is lets start with the kid who plays brian what a geek i couldn t believe the mullet then there was the talking to himself i guess they couldn t just have the movie be silent but still of course they had to have him skinny dipping too not something i wanted to see but jared gave a great performance compared to the special effects department everything from the bear to the crash was something i could do myself and better i seriously doubt that gary paulsen had anything to do with the production seeing as the movie was not even called hatchet finally i do not think the writer had ever read the book seeing as nothing was the same i think the book was great but this movie stunk like a smelly goat 
i had never read gary paulsen s novel hatchet for which a cry in the wild is the adaptation of so i can t make any comparisons to the book i will however say that as a film on its own adaptation or no adaptation it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters think of a cry in the wild as a less luxurious teenage mountaineer was quincy california the only place this was filmed version of cast away jared rushton is year old brian roebson a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself there are basically three parts to the film the obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters namely brian and his mom the next third of the movie which really consumes nearly all of the film is that of brian roughing it these scenes contain no particularly amazing action nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful yukon landscape nothing to put you on edge no real encounters except a brisk confrontation with a cub and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen you might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness brian dealing with his situation through first primitive means and then more improved ones using tools etc for his survival it is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation and that is pretty much about it in other words they put no meat on the paulsen s words when they translated them into a visual media and of course the third part of the movie is his rescue there is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time however some conflict between brian and his parents that created a rocky awkward relationship between them however for the most part it is only explained in brief intermittent minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video any minute the singer from jefferson starship should chime in an start singing sara other than what the viewer can draw from the implications or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters whether or not it really had anything to do with brian s survival adventure in the third part of the movie these are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and for me almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more it certainly was not for me a good adventure tale but for fans of jared rushton it was one of the last few movies he made so watch it purely for nostalgia if nothing else 
who are these they the actors the filmmakers certainly couldn t be the audience this is among the most air puffed productions in existence it s the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot too much fun nobody is getting any actual work done and that almost always makes for a movie that s no fun to watch ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character s status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled bogdanovich the scenes with the breezy ms stratten are sweet but have an embarrassing look guys i m dating the prom queen feel to them ben gazzara sports his usual cat s got canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot which requires him to pursue audrey hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic in the meantime the budding couple s respective children nepotism alert bogdanovich s daughters spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on love while observing their parents ms hepburn drawing on her dignity manages to rise above the proceedings but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself ostensibly everybody looks great but so what it s a movie and we can expect that much if that s what you re looking for you d be better off picking up a copy of vogue oh and it has to be mentioned that colleen camp thoroughly annoys even apart from her singing which while competent is wholly unconvincing the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack surely this is not what gershwin who wrote the song from which the movie s title is derived had in mind his stage musicals of the s may have been slight but at least they were long on charm they all laughed tries to coast on its good intentions but nobody least of all peter bogdanovich has the good sense to put on the brakes due in no small part to the tragic death of dorothy stratten this movie has a special place in the heart of mr bogdanovich he even bought it back from its producers then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn t prove popular his rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of hollywood stories so there s no joy in criticizing the film there _is_ real emotional investment in ms stratten s scenes but laughed is a faint echo of the last picture show paper moon or what s up doc following daisy miller and at long last love it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which p b has never emerged all in all though the movie is harmless only a waste of rental i want to watch people having a good time i ll go to the park on a sunny day for filmic expressions of joy and love i ll stick to ernest lubitsch and jaques demy 
if you look at corey large s information here on imdb apparently there s a movie called reload in production as of june in which he s playing a character named sebastian cole first of all how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel and second didn t sebastian get killed at the end of loaded i watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battling insomnia and so i was drifting in and out while it was on i m sure i missed some plot points but overall it seemed really weak large s performance was for me one of the stronger parts of the film i m also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty but not exceptional 
it s amazing to see how nikhil advani manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release i mean look at the cast here the promotion is superb good enough songs and the trailers are fine this makes it a house full on the first day but it s only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is refundable house full the first day the movie is out the next week this film inspired by love actually is what they say didn t manage to handle the whole cast well they tried to put in big stars but ended up by not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one the stories are hollow and cheesy so the audience can t connect with any single one of them it s a big disappointment to all those who like big stars or for that matter nikhil advani after his big success of kal ho na ho 
i had a video of the thing and i think it was my fourth attempt that i managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep it s slow moving and the idea of a mid atlantic platform which may have been revolutionary at the time is now just a great big yawnaroony apart from conrad veidt the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting when the water started to spill big time it even on one occasion woke me up but give the man his due no one could hold a cigarette like conrad veidt he doesn t wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals he holds it in his fingers while showing us the old pearly browns there are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background and looks very artistically done but it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke 
the acronymic f p stands for floating platform the film portends the building of an f p in the middle of the atlantic ocean to be used as an air station for transatlantic plane flights based a contemporary curt siodmark novel it was filmed in german as f p antwortet nicht in french as i f ne r pond plus and in english as f p soon technology made non stop oceanic travel much more preferable stars conrad veidt as ellissen jill esmond as droste and leslie fenton as claire find love and sabotage on and off the atlantic platform karl hartl directed mr veidt is most fun to watch but he is not convincing in the love triangle with ms esmond and mr fenton the younger co stars were the spouses of laurence olivier and ann dvorak respectively both the concept and film have not aged well f p karl hartl conrad veidt jill esmond leslie fenton
reed diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who s been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands the doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that ll return his lost memories if it works but when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon he chooses to escape instead while outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather greg grunberg mistreats his mother won t let her near the darkroom in his basement acts suspicious in general while the general mystery of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it s revealed i found mr diamond s acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout in the interest of full disclosure i ve been a huge fan of his since homicide and his brief but extremely pivotal role in the shield up through journeyman dollhouse not a great film nor a good one but serviceable enough although i did like it better than the previous films that i ve seen from director writer michael hurst room pumkinhead mansquito eye candy one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination my grade c 
i concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie very poor acting offhand production values utterly pedestrian direction and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written let alone produced even hollywood professionals apparently go to work just for a paycheck although no one should have been paid for this bad work careers should instead have ended over this inconsequential drivel oth there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw droppingly bad and chad lowe is terrifically and consistently bad 
generally i ve found that if you don t hear about a movie prior to seeing it on dvd there s probably a good reason for it i hadn t heard about this movie at all until i was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf since all the good movies had already been rented out the ones i wanted to see anyway i figured i d give this one a shot it s really not much different than other movies in the genre such as the singles ward or the r m if you re into those type movies you ll probably enjoy this however if you re not a mormon this movie probably won t appeal to you there s no way to avoid the overtly religious mormon message contained within and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy ultimately if you don t fall within the mormon demographic you re probably better off watching something else admittedly there were some very funny moments in the film but i didn t think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall 
a dog found in a local kennel is mated with satan and has a litter of puppies one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit run the puppy wants no time in making like donald trump and firing the mexican housekeeper how festive only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch so it s up to dad to say the day this late s made for tv horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia when i saw this as a kid i found it to be a tense nail biter but revisiting it as an adult i now realize that it s merely lame boring and not really well acted in the least bit my grade d
 baptists at our barbecue is the best film ever made now that i got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken let me begin my short overview of this tacky offensive pretentious and boring hunk of junk i guess you could consider a movie first of all the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of christian vuissa and the tacky overly preachy whiny and stilted screenplay by f mathew smith i really despise the fact that it sends a very pro mormon and sort of anti every other religion message yes the story is about a small town half full with mormons and half full with baptists it shows all the main and role model characters being mormon and being so nice and perfect yet they are being picked on by the evil conniving and very judgmental baptists it shows how beautiful mormons are and how cold hearted and ignorant baptists are instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic i m a part of neither religion i m actually an atheist but this offended me along with another countless amount of baptists most likely it shows the baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the mormons and the mormons being very accepting when again in reality there is a mutual like dislike between them sorry i didn t mean to go off on a rant another aspect of baptists at our barbecue i didn t much care for was the acting the performances are very amateurish and unnatural especially from the female lead heather beers miss beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role and i wasn t too much impressed with dan merkley who s the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture but i have to say he s way more talented or shows more talent in this film then heather beers whoever played the town sheriff was awful also although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film it is full of clich s for example the main character tartan merkley finds solace with a native american who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life how clich is that to make the situation even more of a pathetic clich tartan buys the poor lonely heathen a puppy dog ugghhh if you want my advice stay as far away from baptists at our barbecue as you can i saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion all i got was a well piece of crap grade d my ratings guide a absolutley flawless a a masterpiece near perfect a excellent b great b very good b good c a mixed bag c average c disappointing d bad d very bad d absolutley horrendous f not one redeeming quality in this hunk of hollywood feces 
this movie was awful i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through i didn t get the point of the movie what was the point of this movie the soundtrack was bad acting was bad and the story uninspiring the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting there was no chemistry among any of the cast members i don t know this for a fact but i suspect that most of the actors were first timers the movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot that indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie i would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie i want those two hours back if you want to watch good funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons watch napoleon dynamite instead 
i expected this to be a lot better i love tim burton s work so i was really excited to see these online short films well they weren t at all what i had expected i don t really know what exactly it is i don t like i guess they re just sort of dull the sound bothers me and most of the characters although i loved roy the toxic boy and stainboy the match girl episode probably bugged me the most although it was pretty funny i also don t like the way some of the characters die like how match girl basically set the gas station on fire or how the girl who stares died in general roy s death was amusing surprisingly death by a car freshener very original that made me laugh so hard there are some things that aren t appropriate for kids just some language and gore that s about all i have to say 
this series is one of the worst shows i have ever seen terrible acting terrible effects terrible writing you get my drift the stories are so far from the legend of robin hood it s amazing looks like they just wanted to use the name robin hood to attract an audience it might as well have been called new adventures of mr bland acting someone commented before me that if you had imagination you d love this show that is a horrible approach to a tv series a visual media like this should spark your imagination you shouldn t have to force your imagination into something to make it good that would be like the simpsons episode where they try to brainwash homer with a religious propaganda movie and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever if a movie is boring i just make up my own story in conclusion absolute human waste 
as was to be expected a mazursky film made in the s would be counter culture sympathetic towards the hippies and have a lot of hippies in it and naturally it is childishly anti authoritarian e g the scene on the mexican border when sutherland provokes a custom s officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he sutherland has long hair the constant left wing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had i not been prepared for it beforehand sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film and most of these ideas are either about blacks or indians needless to say he would be welcomed with open arms in today s hollywood one of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in beverly hills a race war so to speak in the middle of l a this is the kind of nonsense that mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies fortunately some of sutherland s hippie friends make fun of this black revolution premise and the resulting dialogue isn t bad a little later the jewish guy makes a crack about sutherland making a movie about masturbation and the black problem when the latter starts talking about masturbation another funny moment is when sutherland s older daughter performs some pc crap on stage with her white school mates and they all say we the black people of the republic of south africa there is always a certain amount of self indulgence when hollywood makes a movie about hollywood especially when it s hollywood making a movie about hollywood discussing hollywood doing movies now that s very very self indulgent indeed the scene with fellini playing himself is more amusing than annoying though mazursky throws in the standard flower children and anti vietnam bullshit into the soup and also pokes fun at corporate hollywood but he was is just as much a part of the phony hollywood lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment as anyone else i am pretty sure that he too makes phony small talk in beverly hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesn t know or like but whose money he wants badly for his next left wing project as for his hair he has the worst hair i ve seen in a very long time on film or elsewhere it s sort of like the kind of long hair that a middle aged accountant would have if he grew it long the film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third if you d like to read my parody biography of donald sutherland and other hollywood actors contact me by e mail 
the concept of this made for tv horror movie is ludicrous beyond words but hey it was the late s and literally all stupid horror formats were pretty damn profitable so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog the plot of devil dog is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre simply think of the omen and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of german shepard pups seriously i m not kidding that s what the movie is about during the opening sequence members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by satan himself you d think that the lord of darkness has other things on his mind than to fornicate with a german shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time but apparently not exactly like little damien in the omen one of the puppies is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal but lucky that s the dog s name is pure evil and liquidates annoying neighbors and nosy school teachers in derivative and tamely executed ways he also inflicts his malignant character on the family wife and children but he cannot force the father richard crenna to stick his arm into a lawnmower because he s a chosen one the whole thing becomes too moronic for words when crenna eventually travels to ecuador to search for an ancient wall painting and gets advice from an old witchdoctor who speaks perfect english i guess he learned that living in isolation atop of a mountain his entire life director curtis harrington what s the matter with helen ruby and lead actor richard crenna wait until dark the evil desperately try to create a suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere but all is in vain scenes like cute puppy eyes spontaneously setting fire to a spanish maid or a dog dodging bullets without even moving evoke chuckles instead of frights and not even spooky musical tunes can chance that the special effects are pathetic especially near the end when the satan dog mutates into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall devil dog is a truly dumb movie but it s definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friends and loads of liquor there are entertaining brief cameos of martine beswick dr jekyll and sister hyde as the terrifying cult queen and r g armstrong the car the pack as the evil fruit vegetable and puppy salesman and yes that annoying daughter is the same kid who gets blown away complaining about her ice cream in carpenter s assault on precinct 
i like brad pitt enormously he is an actor with brains and wit not to mention face pectorals and all the rest since i saw him in thelma and louise a thought has been bothering me who does he remind me of troy did it for me he is the new brigitte bardot the differences are obvious of course male american etc but brigitte bardot comes to mind nonetheless he is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it kalifornia monkeys fight club snatch his self deprecating humor makes him human almost accessible fortunately troy will soon be forgotten only still photographs with pitt semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans strange das boot is one of the great films of the second part of the th century what is wolfgang petersen doing directing this well i suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new brigitte bardot 
i had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie after all this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind and it was one of the first epic tales i read as a kid even before tolkien i must say that it was a huge disappointment they completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera the elements that were faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles it was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like achilles who has a strange combination of nearly matrix like powers utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem turn to fabio on the beach in the guise of pitt who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure hollywood has ever produced the actors were actually decent trying to make the best of a ridiculous script it was actually a waste of so much talent peter o toole stole the show and orlando bloom and sean bean were pathetic compare it to lotr or gladiator and it doesn t even hold a candle to them plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege i wouldn t recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was at least they got that part right 
this film is riveting but in much the same way a car crash is riveting it s hard to look away overall this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment and a futile biased experiment at that the filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator the manner in which the money is presented to ted is pure exploitation the intervening steps that the filmmakers force ted to participate in meeting with so called experts were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with ted instead it s painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker s posteriors and to further exploit ted s situation the worst part is that the filmmakers stop following ted after months and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before if they had cared they would have found better experts to help ted if they truly wanted to see what ted would do then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention this film is at best a high brow jackass stunt and not a documentary it s sad to think how much could have actually changed a homeless person s life had it been put in the right hands 
repugnant bronson thriller unfortunately it s technically good and i gave it but it s so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it entertainment far more disturbing than a typical slasher film 
the s were not very kind to one time major star charles bronson starting with s death wish ii and ending with this truly gruesome film from bronson s screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness d w ii left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of bronson s character s daughter a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail to midnight was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards nothing redeeming about it other films like the evil that men do and the remaining death wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge i m not sure if the producers usually pancho kohner got a kick out of showing a weary looking senior citizen aged bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what but the shoddy craftsmanship and terrible scripts of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated kinjite the last of these films is fairly well made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness in this film bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his rolex watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things i ve thankfully forgotten also depicted is the gang rape of a young japanese girl fortunately this was off screen though well implied what were people thinking when they made this film what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films for anyone interested in his best movies check out most of the films he made in the s and s like the mechanic death wish from noon til once upon a time in the west red sun the great escape the magnificent seven rider on the rain etc etc 
what s this a canadian produced zombie flick that i have never heard of before a mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man this allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there basically he and friends went to a cemetery on friday the th and raised the dead thanks to his silly chanting cut back to the morgue where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortician and owner who gets his eyes popped out the final wtf shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screaming i m not crazy amazingly he has his eyeballs back running a scant minutes this is certainly one oddity in zombie cinema it feels a lot longer but put me in some kind of trance where i couldn t stop watching the film also has one of those if you see this image turn away from the screen gags it is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater prophetic and when he pops up only twice the blood begins to flow the scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period there is a great gaffe where a zombie chops off a girl s right hand with a shovel but when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp on it is a left hand 
charles bronson stars as lt crowe a police detective who declares war on a pimp named duke juan fernandez who kidnaps the daughter of a japanese businessman who is the man who sexually harassed crowe s daughter amy hathaway in this sleazy yet stylishly helmed revenge thriller kinjite may not be for everyone with it s somewhat disturbing plot threads but it is well made and indeed entertaining 
you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates a k a reads the script plot synopsis over his character s funeral procession a mere minutes into the movie the narration is his character s last will testament it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his children and servants the children shall split million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants to be eligible they must live in the family estate for a week it sounds like the typical plot of a reality show there is little subtext as to the nature of the deans they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog from the opening voice over by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending that journey is painfully slow and pointless we trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through the fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men constant bickering misplaced circus music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of faux german expressionism the horror aesthetic of the th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting this all inevitably leads to the expected ungratifying ending you will be happy to still be alive but the pain might be too great to bear alone share children share celluloid rehab
a family of terrible people must remain in a house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance which will go to the servants who will only get their inheritance if they agree to stay on and keep the house in order people die and so will you if you try to sit through this if you ve ever had any desire to see bad actors many with ill fitting dentures act or attempt to act in a bad horror movie this is your chance this is just awful its so bad i thought al adamson one of the worst directors ever directed it but i was wrong its so bad i don t want to say anything more about it not because it isn t polite but because once i start i may not be able to stop avoid
a grade z horror filmmaker carl monson was one of the most prolific directors operating within the field of the low budget gory mayhem his movies are full of inept gore laughable acting boring sub plots and woeful dialogue a mysterious black clad figure is savagely murdering guests staying at the family mansion unfortunately this film is almost bloodless you don t actually see the murders except with shadows and a few blood splatters the pace is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting the acting is merely competent but the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointed a generous out of just beware do not mistake monson s film with andy milligan s equally weak legacy of blood 
i happen to have bought one of those legacy of horror movie pack collections and would you believe i m still looking through them to find a good horror movie in it sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like the devil s messenger or the devil bat or one of the great alfred hitchcock s films some aren t horror however and are only on there because hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense but other times it seems that they put movies like the island monster and this on because they can t accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter so we open up to sort of a westing game idea the rich yet cruel and abusive father played by carradine the one standing feature of this has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates carradine gives a good enough performance as always but he s left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre terrible performances the rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes given this was an independent film of the s the lighting and effects are pretty limited it s hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can t see what s happening that well in some scenes some actors like the servants igor and elga give an effort at least and i m ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who done it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film you aren t meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable the death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there it proves that you would probably enjoy the movie pack chilling containing films like house on a haunted hill little shop of horror s with jack nicholson and night of the living dead over it this is best avoided 
blood legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer tom drake norman bartold to the dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased christopher dean john carradine upon his arrival he is greeted by mr dean s four children gregory jeff morrow his wife laura merry anders victoria faith domergue johnny richard davalos plus leslie brooke mills her fella carl isenberg john smith drake plays a tape recording of they re late father s wishes after his death the estate worth million dollars is to be split equally between his four children if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest if all were to die the freaky servants elga ivy bethune igor buck kartalian the more mundanely named frank john russell would pocket the lot well not satisfied with a quarter share of million which is still almost million back in which doesn t sound too bad to me someone decides they want it all for themselves it s not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge co written produced directed by roy monson blood legacy disappointed me on two accounts for starters this film s alternate much more common title is legacy of blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by andy milliagn back in which i ve always wanted to see both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories when i checked my on screen cable tv guide for legacy of blood i was excited because it said it was the milligan film even listed him as director so when i actually sat down to watch it i heard john carradine s voice i then knew it wasn t the milligan film that i had wanted to see my heart sank then of course there s the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that blood legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times the script by monson eric norden is slow boring extremely predictable the character s are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way the freak of a servant who ask s his sister to cane him the strange set of brother s sisters who are just downright unlikeable so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing then there s the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first minutes it s boring to watch it s poorly paced it s just a chore to even think about it please someone save me as this is really bad stuff i could go on all day about how bad blood legacy is i really could director monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he shouldn t have even been directing traffic the entire film looks ugly it s poorly photographed there is no atmosphere or scares the blood gore is tame there s an axe in a head a decapitated head a scene when someone is stung to death by wasp s the best murder when someone s face is eaten by piranha however there are question marks over this scene so there s the victim right there s the tank of piranha right victims head is placed in piranha tank right pirahna eat victims face right water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten erm where s the blood technically blood legacy is terrible it looks awful the sound was obviously shot live it s muffled hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise the acting was not going to win anyone any awards that s for sure the least said about it the better blood legacy is an awful film there really isn t a single positive aspect to it or if there is i can t think of it do yourself a favour don t bother with this one there are much better films out there 
ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man john carradine dying and leaving everything to his four children and his servants to be divided up equally one condition they must spend one week in his estate to get the money and if any of them die the others get more guess what happens next i saw a brand new print of this film on cable the colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful that s about all the good things i can say about it let s list just some of the problems this film has the killer is screamingly obvious the servants are called igor and elga come on some of the sound recording was so bad i couldn t make out the dialogue no great loss i m sure the gore was sparse and very poorly done the other murders were simply boring stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable acting so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief even pro jeff morrow was terrible the only fairly good acting was from trouper faith domergue who deserved better than this and john carradine who looks painfully old and frail here i do have to admit though the closing line in this movie is a gem why this was renamed legacy of blood is beyond me there s another horror film with that name whatever its name is it s a bad movie to be avoided at all costs 
you all know the story of hamlet i do well the to be or not to be phrase not the speech itself has been beaten into the ground so many times that it s not very interesting in fact it wasn t that great to begin with in fact i find hamlet a good but vastly overrated play it s not even shakespeare s best julius caesar and romeo juliet are ten times better with a midsummer night s dream and othello not too far behind macbeth knock your table off his drawers puck will make amends ow isn t that bad either there are lots of others that are better than this by shakespeare i won t really comment too much on the movie rather i will dissect the utterly horrible mst k episode okay mike and the bots win a card game get to pick the movie they ask for hamlet pearl sends them this yadda yadda yadda and prepare for the most boring sci fi episode of mst k ever admittedly i haven t seen any of the cc ones while blood waters of dr z makes the viewing of that episode horrible since it is not really a movie rather random spliced together scenes i m reminded of mike s line from future war maybe this is an anthology of short plotless movies the sol crew a lot got off a good many good cracks can t say the same for here the riffs fall flat the host segments par usual are at best mediocre and when the movie itself which isn t that bad is actually better i mean as a quality movie not as camp like prince of space than the mst k version of it you know the show must be bad i laughed the last time i saw it was several months ago oh maybe eight or nine times throughout i tried and tried and tried to be entertained but i just couldn t only the occasional line like hail queen dilbert s boss and when that s the funniest line of the episode well ahem and by occasional i mean every ten minutes or so maybe me even chuckle the second time i tried to watch it i didn t even laugh at the few jokes i d found funny before and simply gave up forty minutes before the movie isn t horrible it s just a german version of hamlet the actors are good enough and though the dubbing isn t the greatest that s not in itself a reason to hate this film four stars for hamlet three yes three for the mst k version ps why why why mst k 
ming the merciless does a little bardwork and a movie most foul 
i literally fell asleep times watching this movie granted it s shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based story the largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters often during character s interacting it s nearly difficult to distinguish who s lines are who s granted i believe this movie is dubbed in english certainly they could ve obtained voice actors which could ve added a bit more drama to these classic literary lines it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than although perhaps that s based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget still it s absolutely painful and boring if you insist on hamlet do yourself a favor and read the book again 
poor will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible german tv adaptaion of his classic play it s obvious that very little money was spent on it a stage riser a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set the movie was ineptly dubbed into english with the english voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines the whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it and just where was fonterbras in this movie anyway mst k gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved to be or not to be i wish this movie never was in the first place 
i m a fan of both shakespeare and mst k so i waited anxiously to see this episode i ll comment on the movie first then the mst k episode the recipe for this movie take talented actors rich and beautiful shakespeare material and a budget mix well then drain of all life and movement until dull and lifeless serve cold in a big plain stone cauldron movie i give out of because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit okay now the mst k episode i ll admit it the first time i saw it i fell asleep halfway through i understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well however when i watched it a second time i realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines i missed the first time around the trick with this episode is listen carefully it takes a couple of viewings to catch each line give it a second chance and you ll see what i mean mst k episode out of 
take a famous play a director with now ideas of his own who is using a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in an actor for the lead who has no feeling for the part he s playing and you ll get hamlet prinz von d nemark i listened to the radio play of hamlet with maximilian schell as hamlet and i was so disappointed i hoped that the filmed version would be better that schell would at least have a body language to underline what he s saying nothing then the set the minimalistic design is not everyone s taste but usually i like it when there s just enough on the stage to make clear what s the setting and nothing more alas that s on a stage in a theatre it won t work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings that the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which schell played the hamlet already let s say if that was the only thing to complain about i ask myself how schell could get the part of hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play hamlet a second time if you ve got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on hamlet don t watch this one unless you re a masochist or really hardcore or like to poke fun on untalented actors 
 this verson doesn t mangle the bard that badly it s still a horrible minimalist production hamlet s dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a spaniard whether it s ricardo montalban or not is subject to debate and maximilian schell overacts like never before most of the dialogue makes it through unscathed and the fact that the mst k version feels obliged to point out repeatedly that the speeches are long duh doesn t strike me as incredibly humorous mostly it s just bad acting though 
i rented the video of the piano teacher knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box i did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at cannes are usually very good or very bad unfortunately this one falls in the latter category about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud this movie is boring about half way through i was saying to myself where have i seen this before at the three quarters mark i had figured it out in spite of its literary origins this film is essentially a remake of robert altman s much earlier and better that cold day in the park although the details obviously differ and altman s work was more plot driven and less of a character study the two films are thematically identical there is nothing new to be seen in this production every aspect of it has been done before a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self destructive behavior abel ferrara s bad lieutenant a perverse and doomed love culminating in an operatic near death scene david cronenberg s m butterfly uncommonly brutal sex scenes david lynch s blue velvet and so on hence i am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be shocking shattering etc this highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable and clearly succeeded with some however i largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film viewing experience see enough movies and you really will eventually have seen it all and while it is true that i saw the expurgated r rated version i doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of the piano teacher technically the film is not without merit there is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent isabelle huppert s creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time this is the first of haneke s films that i ve seen and if i were to see more i expect i would have the same opinion of him that i have of ferrara an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be rating 
a movie has rarely left me as cold as this one there is not a bit of tension not a second of fear not a moment we jump even a little bit the girl is cute yeah that s it was that worth a movie i knew it wasn t supposed to be a great movie but i was at least expecting one

i saw it i agree with him but i didn t care for his delivery he just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited contrived juvenile smear campaign edit cuts galore etc the camera would be focused on him and you d see or edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot which is a film no no this documentary hits a topic with so many angles so many interesting stories that the movie is just so easily done picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid it is so easy it is just wrong i mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags to make them contradict themselves you just let them recite more then a verse or two i do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselves i just think he could have done something a little more creative the part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out it could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs or sex or he could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new rob zombie movie more could have gone into the history of john smith the mormon founder who had quite the colorful past delve into science v s religion one is a very methodical very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories it builds on itself from a solid bottom up a new layer on top of a more proved layer an enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way the other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims it is so because well i said so done right i d say turn it into an hbo original series hit a different religion every week it was an eye opener about one thing i must have been blind good ole g w bush no wonder he got elected he had the religious majority and well now that is the blind leading the blind bill moyer well what can i expect from a guy who hands out at sutra in newport beach 
some funny bits but come bill a film quoting zeitgeist keep the tv show and the interviews but a film i m probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film i don t know i laughed disagreed agreed this film is very confusing and inconsistent bill s a funny guy but also very cocky bill s rhetoric is similar to bill hicks a brilliant comedian but like many comedians the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying i think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility this might be just a personal taste but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism i agree with bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible but the response to it cannot be sensible it will create unnecessary turmoil we can do better than just react to fundamentalism his conclusion is that we don t know and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion his humility that he only knows that he doesn t is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non sense i had great trouble seeing bits of zeitgeist the movie in bill s film all the astrotheology influenced non sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable religion studies scholarship it is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources astro mystic sources that reduce everything to the stars say it all seem to be from the middle ages this film is a confusing statement from a confused agnostic agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as we don t know this film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history watch the film it has hilarious interviews and bits but please do not behave like bill you cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line his arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation there needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues 
a craven cowardly film director boorman shows cahill burglarizing rich houses but the male occupant is shown being unfaithful with the nanny thats all right then the forensic scientist investigating cahill is blown up in his car but he is rat faced sourpuss and doesn t look like a nice man so thats all right too the beits owner of russborrough house made their money by exploiting darkies digging up diamonds so it s okay to rob priceless art from them and hide it in a bunker in the wicklow mountains the garda kill his ferrets and are implicated in his murder the moral equivalencing is sickening boorman looks for a hit film but doesn t have the guts to stand against the criminality of the generals gang who terrorized the neighbourhood and unleashed another wave of scumbags upon dublin he even liaised with the generals son while making it disgusting shame on him for his cowardice 
where to start oh yea message to the bad guys when you first find the person you have been tracking in order to kill that witnessed a crime you committed don t spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away message to the victim when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing take that opportunity to run away don t sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear message to the director if someone has a or minute head start in a vehicle or on foot you can t have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away time and motion doesn t work that way it would also be nice to think that a woman doesn t have to brutally kill men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home 
townies is the laziest movie i have ever seen and i saw the blair witch movies parts one and two it seems confused in what it wants to be it s not funny enough for comedy it s not tragic enough for drama it s not bloody enough for horror and it s not good enough for watching it has scenes of a man doing slapstick bloody karate so i think oh this movie will be in the vein of toxic avenger and street trash then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl a retarded mentally handicap woman and a trusting mother then it slaps itself into the only good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks the part i m speaking of is a lonely townie who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse that was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling the rest was a waist of my life then just to show how cruel wayne is there is a kind of documentary at the end of the film of wayne the director making fun of toby the star in public it made me sick even though killer nerd and bride of killer nerd two other movies by wayne aren t the best they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits i even like killer nerd a bit it had some great lines i still use to this day if you like underground films if you like overground films and if you like to watch your feet just resting were they are you will not like townies out of 
the strange people living in a town go about their lives there s the licker a guy who licks everything a dumpster diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her a guy who wants to cleanse girls of their wicked ways offbeat in the extreme this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color the monochrome takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel like a troma movie this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for weirds sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the time not always but enough for it not to be fun though i didn t see the cleansing coming worth a shot if you ve nothing else to watch and you re waiting for the next set of golden girls to come from netflix 
the only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes other than that this movie is a big dud we have kim basinger the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first min of the movie which added nothing then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with punks who took up parking spaces on this busy xmas eve they begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her from there this movie gets worse way worse i know its only a movie and you ve gotta go with the flow but she s got about a min headstart and she can t hide or find someone to help her instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest in typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her but now she turns into one tough mofu you get the point do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type it s so illogical you ll be questioning every scene it is embarrassing for basinger and craig sheffer and the rest of the cast as well as the consumers 
in what could have been an otherwise run of the mill mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties the subtle free love period the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top happily ever after ending at no time did i ever feel sympathy for diane lane or anna paquin in their troublesome middle class care free life nor did i feel for the emasculated liev shrieber the story line plods along slowly to its predictable pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning diane lane topless here s a hint it occurs about minutes into the film fast forward to that part and skip the rest 
tony goldwyn is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing a walk on the moon appears to have borrowed from other better made films the present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class jews not far from woodstock the screen treatment by pamela gray doesn t have much going for it so it s a puzzle why mr goldwyn decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at direction the kantrowitz family is spending some time at the resort we see them arrive at the small bungalow that is going to be their temporary home marty the father comes only for the week end he works in what appears to be a family small appliance business repairing television sets mostly in a few days the first man will walk in space so the excitement is evident the kantrowitz women are left behind pearl marty s wife and her mother in law lilian spend idle days in the place until the blouse salesman arrives pearl goes browsing and she finds much more than a shmatte she gets the salesman as well it appears that pearl and marty have no sexual life at all after two children pearl who appears to be sexy and with a high libido is ready for some extra marital fun that is the basic premise for the film which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter alison decides to play hooky and go to the woodstock festival nearby where horror of horrors she witnesses her own mom making out with the blouse salesman what s a girl to do well stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties are happily reunited by the little son s bedside when he is stung by wasps and the salesman comes to apply some home remedy and daddy is called from the city after knowing about pearl s betrayal with the younger stud poor diane lane she went to make unfaithful later on which is the upscale version of this dud viggo mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female customers whispering little somethings in their ears liev schreiber as marty the cuckolded husband doesn t have much to do anna paquin plays the rebellious alison and tovah feldshuh is the unhappy nana who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first hand one that is playing in her own backyard watch it at your risk or pop the dvd in the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh or two dishing the film 
seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with ronnie o`sullivan defeating greame dott by frames to bbc found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast a walk on the moon a movie i had absolutely no knowledge off i missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea viggo mortensen starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap tvm certainly the opening with the mawkish pearl and marty taking their kids to a summer camp has that sort of made for tv feel though the brightly lit too brightly lit cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it wasn`t until the appearence of viggo mortensen as hippy guy walker that i realised this was a cinema release after all someone of mortensen`s stature wouldn`t star in a tvm i mean that`s like a legend like robert deniro appearing in a straight to video film wait a minute didn`t bob some people on this site have mentioned that pearl and marty are an unconvincing on screen couple and i agree i can understand why pearl would be attracted to exciting hippy guy but have no idea why walker would be attracted to plain house wife pearl the sixties was before my time but surely if you`ve got the choice between hippy chicks and bored house wives it`s not really a choice at all mind you a lot of people took lsd in those days so i guess that explains it i feel the major problem of a walk on the moon comes down to the fact it`s a romantic drama at heart just like you`d expect in a tvm with several cloying coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene it jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were something in i say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and woodstock in other words a walk on the moon tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them
recently i had opportunity to view a working print in kansas city olathe ks of this title it is difficult for me being a lover of the art as i am to report the following but the truth sometimes hurts and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe i m using the slang definition here worthless statements or writing for an hour and a half i feel obligated to share warn any interested parties let s begin at the beginning a good place to start as always the first minutes are not really that bad a couple of laughs and decent development but then it is downhill from there this is the story of a woman in her mid thirties that as the writer would like for you to believe is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled the first major difficulty occurs when if you don t know that fact going into the movie you won t know it when she suddenly risks it all for in my opinion a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman there is little development drastically insufficient development to justify her actions for the affair she has and when it occurs one feels as i did that she is just of low moral character the word slut comes to mind hopefully they ll let that pass the review and post the comment this in my opinion is the first fatal flaw of the film if you re married or have ever been in love irregardless of whether you are male or female its going to turn you off quite frankly i feel that it would have made a much better blue movie that s the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving the second fatal flaw is the casting diane lane just didn t work for me here and viggo mortensen is not the right man for the job believe me the only saving grace to the entire film is anna paquin the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places conveying a subtle yet very blunt i apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate portrayal of an emerging teen bravo well done i m not going to give the ending away but i was disappointed being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing but an ending like that well if that teased you enough to see this picture don t say i didn t warn you but you better look fast if this celluloid is released i doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames i d say wait for the video but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value hmmm dustin hoffman produced this you think he d learn after ishtar this film once carried the working title blouse man and should have been left on the rack if you ve never in your life wanted to walk out on a film give this one minutes the only thing worth staying for is anna paquin if you can stomach the fact that you ll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you re off to the movies to see this one that s my two cents for what it is worth 
any movie that portrays the hard working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored cheating wife is an obvious result of years of the clinton era it s little wonder that this movie was written by a woman 
why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others replace woodstock with the civil war and the apollo moon landing with the titanic sinking and you ve got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low life trash is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to woodstock and who failed grade school composition do i ll show those old meanies i ll put out my own movie and prove that you don t have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money yeah we already know that the one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking the next time i see a slut in a bar who looks like diane lane i m running the other way it s child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids it s audience abuse to simply stick woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 
in case half of this film s footage looks strangely familiar it means you watch way too much of this gory italian cult crap for you see the notorious demigod lucio fulci did not only produce this movie he also took the liberty of re using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own and more easily traceable cat in the brain the opening scene already in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe features in fulci s later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments andrea bianchi s masssacre fails miserably as a giallo since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful but it s still good entertainment if you re into cheap n shlocky horror trash the incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who re all potential maniacs but none of the red herrings biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast whenever there isn t any bloodshed on screen like between the first and second murder massacre is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography thankfully in the second half there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes the music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative my advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned cat in the brain that one features all the great moments of massacre and then some 
prior to this film i had only seen two films by director andrea bianchi the trashy zombie flick le notti del terrore famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man child peter bark and the enjoyably sleazy giallo strip nude for your killer neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema but both were entertaining in their own special way and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn t hurt massacre however is dull dull dull despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh the story about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot is confusing and oh so boring when the blood isn t flowing and the skin isn t on show the film is a real struggle to sit through it took me four attempts to finish with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note the only point of interest about the film is that its producer lucio fulci used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega gory movie cat in the brain aka nightmare concert and if you ve already seen that film then there is very little reason to bother with massacre 
massacre is a film directed by andrea bianchi burial ground and produced by legendary italian horror director lucio fulci now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest this could not be further from that massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films i have seen come out of italian cinema i was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and i have never had that problem with italian horror films massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax this scene was used in fulci s nightmare concert this isn t a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter unfortuanitly the next hour of the movie is so boring the movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away the last minutes of the movie aren t so bad but still could have been much better the gore in the movie was pathetic and since fulci used most of the gore scenes in nightmare concert there was nothing new here the end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor this wasn t a very good film but for a true italian horror freak like myself this movie is a must have since it is very rare stars
kevin spacey is very talented but unfortunately directing is not his forte i had high expectations about the film before i rented it and maybe that is why i disliked it so much i admire spacey s attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting but it s not the attempt that counts i found the film dull boring and stretched out the acting was nothing spectacular gary sinise has done much better especially since he is conscious in most of his other films skeet ulrich was disappointing but this was one of his first films i did get a kick out of how young and chubby this scream star looked the only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above the center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck however that shot was very usual suspects ish and my guess is spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his which is very good mind you if you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting watch hitchcock s lifeboat maybe spacey should have watched it before filming this 
a trio of low life criminals led by matt dillon botches a late night burglary they flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist the real terrorist gets away and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar taking hostages unaware why the police are so intent on catching them and guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night unbelievable absolutely and it goes down hill from there spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent matt dillon faye dunaway gary sinise viggo mortensen and m emmett walsh but they re all wasted mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar all they do for the remainder of the film is argue endlessly and aimlessly long before the conclusion of the film you ve stopped giving a damn about what happens to them 
by dane youssef a gang of crooks the perfect plan it all goes wrong they re in trouble the police are outside they re cornered what are they gonna do now sound familiar the movie seems like it s trying to be a combination of the acting workshop the indie film and the theater it s the kind of things that actors love it s kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting acting angry tense scared conversing scheming planning giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up a trio of crooks one leader one goon one brother come up with a big heist scheme and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works to top things off there s a bit of a fender bender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield the cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically and leadenly dino s last chance spacey as a director tries to keep the focus on the actors performances and delivery of dialouge he pans over to a bright passion red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering bogart and he keeps all the violence off screen really i think that was a mistake focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge the problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role matt dillon drugstore cowboy and wild things seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang gary sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag along with these guys and joe mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul swearing mad dog police lieutenant who s all thumbs but he isn t given anything to really do here william fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood and the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going the characters are mostly chatting away trying to think of a plan and they re to calm and too articulate there s even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside ready to strike at one point one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar oh brother oh bother these cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up shouldn t the holed up crooks be a little scared a little uneasy meanwhile all the real action is happening inside someone whips out a gun a baseball bat which leads to an ugly confrontation off screen and there s one more casualty that happens that s well kinda sad but faye dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach improving on her new orleans accent skeet ullrich is fine in a smaller part a cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look and so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield the dialouge is obviously trying to go for a david mamet approach and it s as profane but never as realistic or as insightful the movie feels like too much of what it really is a really low budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that s not bad but needs a few more re writes spacey shows he s not a terrible director but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like he s just filming actors act these actors are all talented and could work with the material but they all feel out of place as i said before the movie really suffers from miscasting i don t mean that the wrong actors were cast i think they found just the right cast but placed them in all the wrong roles i think switching some of the roles would ve helped immensely having veteran mob actor joe mantagna play the leader of the pack gary sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops keeping fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and matt dillion as the sacrificial lamb that would have been a big improvement when some actors direct it works they can even win oscars for it but a lot of the time when actors direct they have a tendency to just focus on the performances just shoot the actors acting sometimes it works but they need a good showcase for it an excuse for it hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming of age stories so it s only natural that movies about them will go from point a to point b as well there are a few really great entries into this genre spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations the negotiator this certainly won t become a cult classic let alone one of afi s still it does have a few nice moments and personal touches but in the end it s instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular tv it s just not worth going out of your way to see i give a out of spacey s other directorial credit beyond the sea was reportedly a better effort hmmm maybe it s true you need to fail before you succeed by dane youssef
on the face of it this should be a great film a great cast a plot with many possibilities and one of hollywood s finest behind the camera for the first time however its clear why it was another years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again this movie fails on so many levels in a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director not so here the great cast is horribly under used none more so than the great late john spencer the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you haven t seen in a hundred other tv movies there is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists at least we know spacey has a lot of mates and clout in hollywood studios to get away with a poor flick like this
although it has been years i still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie unfortunately i came across this movie after my friends and i selected it while browsing through the new releases at blockbuster we decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable although it has been quite some time since i viewed the movie i still remember the lack of plot seriously there is no true plot and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie if you are in the video store and this film catches your eye walk on and find a better movie if you did end up seeing this movie i understand your pain 
i saw this movie on t v this afternoon and i can t see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash it s not funny at all and it takes your i q down a few notches i know this movie is for kids but that doesn t mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted i bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a the word poop equals big laugh b a four foot tall kid can dunk on a ten foot tall basketball net c kids should always fight kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d months of karate training is all you need to beat up so called ninjas with swords one good thing i can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban gang in the world that couldn t scare anybody maybe the guys at mst k could use this movie for a good laugh don t bother with this lame ass excuse for a movie 
 because out of times the producers lied through their teeth or someone else s to get you to rent or buy their mercifully censored shock o rama cinema proves the truth of this yet one more time with the release of feeding the masses a possibly well intentioned but utterly inept and dismal entry into the zombie genre folks this is not only low budget film making this is very low budget film making by a bunch of people who i m sorry i know they have families who love them will never ever be in variety in any significant fashion this is one baaaaaaaaaad mooin pitcher folks and not just because it s cheap the acting is mediocre but i don t blame the actors they had no direction they had no direction because the script was a half baked zombie fantasy with no sense of real cinematic storytelling characterization is thin at best no thanks to weak dialogue and soporific direction have i mentioned yet that the script and the direction are pretty lame they are there s no drama no tension no great character moments nothing the whole premise of government suppression of the media is squandered on sophomoric commercial breaks and an undramatic storyline that defies rational analysis and awkwardly shambles to its ridiculous finish syd fields would not be pleased how could the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic when the reality of it would be apparent everywhere why would they give it more than a cursory try in this day and age of cellphone cameras with wireless access what could they possibly hope to accomplish for more than a day or so at best now if they were covering something up like their own culpability but feeding the masses never explores such possibilities instead it dwells on absurdity and poorly staged events to dig for laughs and or significance praying its audience won t notice the near total lack of production value beyond basic film making equipment did anyone in this film get paid i hope the actors did if only for their time wasted on career blind alleys like this one at least the techies got to rack up some legitimate work experience even zombie fans will find little to gain from feeding the masses the gore is remarkably tame for no budgeters of its rank and there are no distinctive set pieces or memorable effects they re all eminently forgettable in fact knb has nothing to fear even junk like the aussie stillbirth undead was miles ahead of feeding the masses sorry guys back to the drawing boards and take your deceptive marketing with you 
please for the love of god don t watch it now saying that i know what you re thinking it can t be that bad can it if everyone says it as bad as they say i have to watch it don t do it it ll be like looking at a horrible accident involving little babies and a gasoline tanker you ll be scarred for life the image will never leave you i could only watch a half hour of this before becoming violently sick the acting is the worst i ve ever seen and i ve seen barbwire if you do risk ripping your eyes out and rent this movie don t say i haven t warned you the cover and storyline are a trap zombies satire shaun of the dead was great this movie must be the same right no the writing crap directing garbage acting there was no acting still not convinced then forever your soul will be tormented 
although nothing can compare to vampires vs zombies in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie firstly the special effects were breath taking when there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me simply stunning my friends but the scene when the jack black sound a like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself but don t worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on i must be high seriously he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about non congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be high to justify his awful acting well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers directors executive producers sponsors you will probably get the same response seriously with a production team called shock o rama i was shocked i didn t place a sawed off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was played if you want to see this movie then you should be murdered yours truly the general
this is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie film i have ever had the misfortune to see terrible terrible terrible any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker the filmmakers family or a friend of the filmmaker how does this film suck let us count the ways the plot incoherent dialogue atrocious i will not slam the effects gore as i understand that this is low budget but was there even one zombie that was not obese c mon and for a film set in rhode island why did that truck sport a massachusetts plate continuity find some the girl dancing while the soldier stands at attention please don t put your ex girlfriend or buddy s sister in your movie naked this was an ugly movie filled with ugly people and has no business even mentioning romero on the cover next time you decide to make a movie don t 
feeding the masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard earned dollars suggestion keep your hard earned dollars and let s just say that good old theatrex took one for the team on this one guess what the plots about zombies taking over this time though for the sake of originality this film takes place in rhode island and to be honest i m not sure i ve ever seen a zombie flick based in rhode island a tv station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won t think that there s any problem in the world that is those that never look or go outside anyway i will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film there is actually somewhat of a story to this but i m not bothering with that because after a while you ll either not care or have fallen asleep at any rate this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the seen it all before stuff that gets trotted out before the camera trust me you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this out of 
this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie ever and what is up with the casting the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose dis figuration and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose you could go to your local grocery store on a sunday afternoon and easily find more qualified better looking possible leading ladies i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a cool dvd case this movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film
i couldn t believe this terrible movie was actually made at all with the worst actors you could find the worst script written mark frost sollace mitchell and by far the worst waste of time in viewing i won t belabor the story as it s really not worth it but i will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story as to the story it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did that in reality the wife couldn t defend herself against a little bitty of a thing that the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all that the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up and the final result of the film is an insult to justice movie codes and the male species the theme of this mess is let women do as they wish kill whom they want defend the killer and get away with it while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim hard to believe that sollace mitchell the director and a man would even want to make this dribble as to the acting jordan ladd the killer is awful a loony toons who does needlepoint during her murder trial is this allowed in court she bored me to the hilt one more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and i d throw up she s not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife the husband played on one level by vincent spano just seems to look and act stupid most of the time he was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him the worst by far was holland taylor as the defense attourney she over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice if she would cross examine me anytime i d have told her to go take a hike everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do so i wish i could give this film a zero rating however we are forced to start with too bad let s not have anymore painful watching films like this lifetime can do better then this i know it this is a postscript made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake as soon as i saw the bimbo jordan ladd i knew i d seen it before and didn t like it or her i not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like sollace mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick doesen t anyone see that her his message is that sickness pays being ill and going around killing people is okay with this director writer totally making the male species idiots well this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful we re not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie which in this person s mind deserves to be trashed and again this loser is shown why can t you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo jordan ladd again and again get her off tv films and out of sight she s just terrible in every sense of the word phew 
 may seem far fetched but there really was a real life story of a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife were staying and she killed the wife making it look like a murder rape in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him so she quit her job in wisconsin and moved to minnesota last i heard she was in a mental institution security prison she was still wearing the engagement ring that she has purchased for herself and had told everyone that he had bought it for her the events took place in a small town in wisconsin and the murder happened in minnesota there even was a feature story in people magazine spring of i want to say on page i remember this as i was in college at the time and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital 
 the deadly look of love is essentially fatal attraction with a couple of twists added onto the back half the ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies of the week it is yet another cautionary tale about succumbing to temptation and it adds nothing fresh to the genre brett vincent spano is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a sizable trust fund even though he has it all he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with janet jordan ladd janet a doe eyed blonde from cedar falls falls hard for brett and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement shortly after the wedding mrs brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large luxurious home she shared with her new husband when the police question brett he promptly points the finger at janet following her arrest janet seems to get loonier by the minute not that she was the picture of stability before her defense attorney holland taylor is convinced that janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it did she do it or didn t she how will it end you can find out the answers to these questions the next time the deadly look of love airs on your local station and be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story men are pigs and women are crazy 
absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality it has camp councellor angela pamela anderson awful as the killer her quips when she wastes people aren t even amusing on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior we run the gamut of boring clich d killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his freddy clawed glove a kid who gets a chainsaw one girl who gets drilled one who gets shoved into the crapper filled with leeches one who is roasted etc it doesn t have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time that is unless you want to see valerie hartmen s who plays the slut ally tits most of the violence occurs off screen so even that will not satisfy 
despite being a sequel to the more potent original this is more of a comical remake of friday the th concerning the further antics of psychopathic angela killing more nubile teens for their immorality at a camp pamela springsteen sister of bruce looks great there are some pretty darn funny sex scenes with some pretty darn attractive girls but the movie s so unintentionally comedic rather than suspenseful it s a stinker out of mpaa rated r for graphic violence and gore nudity and for some sexuality language and drug use 
this movie was bad from the start the only purpose of the movie was that angela wanted to get a high body count the acting was horrible the killings were acted out very badly like when ally got stuffed down that toilet i guess it was in the abandoned cabin but when the end of the movie comes and molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see ally so angela must have gone in to get her the part that really got me was when the black girl and angela were in the cabin and angela took the guitar string and chocked her one it was horrible acting and two why wouldn t you just turn around and punch the bitch then when molly is getting chased by angela if you have the neigh why not just turn around and stab her so stupid this movie sucked 
this is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage that no doubt wants to be a friday the th clone the poster for this movie makes it look like there s going to be some sort of a cross between jason and freddy which is likely to attract movie goers there is nothing good or entertaining about this movie about this movie it just makes me sad just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers on video or dvd and waste their time with this sad cynical depressing movie angela baker pamela springsteen is a camp counselor at camp rolling hills who hopes that the other campers are as nice as she is and that they stay out of trouble meanwhile the other campers are realizing that people are disappearing one by one with angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home could angela be the killer who was once a man who underwent a sex change operation years earlier who knows who cares the s was home to a lot of movies that made the cross between the mad slasher and dead teenager genres in which a mad killer goes berserk some have a plot some don t but they re all about as bad as this one sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers is minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed strangled impaled chopped up burned alive and mutilated that s all this movie is it is just mindless bloody violence watching this movie i was reminded of the friday the th movies in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be hacked to death the filmmakers of sleepaway camp ii have every right to be ashamed of themselves imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers the world is a totally evil place this movie tells you and it ll kill you it doesn t matter what your dreams or your hopes are it doesn t matter if you have a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend it doesn t matter what you think what you do or what your plans for the future are you can forget those plans because you re just going to wind up dead and the sickest thing is and by not giving too much away the movie simply sets up room for a sequel well why not they ve probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies i missed out on the original sleepaway camp and after watching its first sequel i will hopefully stay away from the other sequels as well as the original and for parents if you know kids who actually like this movie do not let them date your children 
no wonder pamela springsteen gave up acting to become a full time photographer it s a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one while this movie is not without its interesting elements mullets from hell etc it is outweighed by flaws for one thing angela the murderous counselor appears to be about the same age as the campers having an older more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film and then you have the murder scenes the budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly no pun intended although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original but overall there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching 
being a slasher film aficionado i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain i will say while channel surfing the other night sleepaway camp ii happened to cross paths with me of course i wanted to check it out as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise but have never actually seen any of them for shame i know i will note that since i have not seen the original my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise s own design now i m assuming that the franchise of sleepaway camp is in itself a joke on itself hell even the name comes off as an intentional joke sleep away camp it s good fun i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value but that s about as far as i can go the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the th look like thespians doing a rendition of macbeth campy requires bad acting but come on pamela springsteen as the evil out of touch with reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast as far as comedy goes there were a few times where i chuckled but it was few and far between ultimately sac ii is pretty boring and i really did want to sleep away the camp the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them if you re looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp i recommend club dread if your channel surfing takes you across this one check and see what else is on 
after the debacle of the first sleepaway camp who thought that a franchise could be born sc ii is superior in aspect more inspired killings and just whole lot more fun while that might not be saying much compared to the first movie sleepaway camp ii is worth the rental pros entertaining doesn t take itself too seriously like sc i inspired killings cons crappy acting and mullets abound bottom line 
why review good movies when you can review trancers ii ooh this film is soooo lame i can just picture the cast and crew driving around l a with a camcorder hurling extras in silly monster make up at poor long suffering tim thomerson the stars families actually turn up to play cameos probably because full moon couldn t afford real extras lame effects lame sets and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots this must be classic trancers and yet and yet it rules note this is the same thing i say about trancers iv i say it because it s true what can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies then bust out with quips like don t worry ladies they re bio degradable well lots of things could be better but anyway this is still good stuff my only significant reservation is megan ward who really stinks up the joint she s a lousy rival for helen hunt s character they re both young pieces of eye candy and it would ve been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more oh well you can t have everything at least the wonderful plot device of the long second watch is back in place and we ve got more of hap ashby the least convincing athlete in the history of cinema oh wait a minute he s got a rival in the form of david ogden steirs in creator i haven t seen this lately but i do seem to remember that martine beswick runs away twice during the final battle hooray for lousy continuity just one of the many highlights in this fine film 
since the s writer producer director charles band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction fantasy and horror b movies some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect many of them are pretty bad trancers was one of those rare gems a terminator style tale of time travel and action trancers saw tim thomerson playing jack deth a future cop given the task of tracking down bad guy whistler who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers converting them into obedient zombies the trancers of the title and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future jack follows him to determined to stop him in this sequel jack is still living in having destroyed whistler he has settled down and married leena helen hunt the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie but for jack things don t stay calm for long and trouble appears in the form of whistler s brother e d wardo who is trying to build a trancer army trancers ii lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was the story is difficult to pick up if you haven t seen the first film or at least not for a long while and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects gone is the inventiveness and wit that made trancers so much fun instead we get some cheesy one liners and a script that feels like it was written on the fly about the only reason i can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci fi and horror movies jeffrey combs barbara crampton richard lynch martine beswicke unfortunately most of them seemed to be having an off day whilst filming trancers ii and performances are mediocre at best the trancers series obviously has its fans four further sequels have since been churned out unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing i can t imagine them being any good 
annie s wig does not look good she is not cute and pretty enough to play annie annie sticks out in the movie as her outfits look like halloween costumes terrible acting and terrible plots this movie is such a change from the version i think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role ashley johnson portrays a very boyish annie not appealing at all at least the casting director got it right with daddy warbucks ms hannigan was also miscast camilla belle played molly alright warning this movie might insult your iq so you might just want to only show it to very young children and younger some of the plots are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world 
not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about annie the characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production it was very clearly made for tv yet if i found it on my television i would flick it straight over the children in the film do an alright job yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in this film lacked the music dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the annie we all love johnson as annie is at times annoying and over acted you cannot convince yourself that she truly is annie the differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film sad to say this sequel was a total flop 
christ a sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time this at least has the decency to leave out the songs bar a reprise of the unbearable tomorrow but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny this time annie and her friends head off to london and get caught up in joan collins s plot to blow up buckingham palace or some such shite the movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is every time the little bugger squeals leapin lizards i could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder drearily photographed slushy and plodding the movie has only one memorable line unhand me you stupid genius and the fact that it s not the original to recommend it 
worst movie with the best reviews given it i ve ever seen over the top dialog acting and direction more slasher flick than thriller with all the great reviews this movie got i m appalled that it turned out so silly shame on you martin scorsese
i m surprised this movie is rated so highly although if i were to go with typical grade scale is a c or d so perhaps that s all right but this movie was just a typical thriller except boringly slow and unrealistic not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to and yet the woman who got rapped didn t press charges because she didn t want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she didn t even know there were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill beat kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd so now i ve just waisted more of my life for this stupid movie so please don t see it so at least your life won t be waisted and that way my hours or so has meant something 
i really don t want to compare martin scorsese s cape fear to the classic cape fear film but i can t help it not only am i a huge fan of the robert mitchum and gregory peck starred cape fear but when scorsese includes scenes right out of the previous film cady taking the keys out of the ignition dog dying and even using bernard herrmann s score throughout the entire film he s not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as i can t help but think of the classic cape fear nearly every scene when comparing scorsese s version of cape fear to the classic version the remake comes out destroyed by the classic but even when taking the film by itself it s still bad now scorsese and screenwriter wesley strick didn t just remake the cape fear scene for scene they tried to do things differently unfortunately this is one of the film s problems gone is the original crazy and animal like max cady who is out for personal revenge the max cady in the version is a religious fanatic out to save sam bowden and who is in touch with his feminine side his words not mine also gone is the stand up and strong sam bowden seen in the classic cape fear film the sam found in the remake is very goofy magoo distrustful and very unlikable even mrs bowden is a completely different character she s crazier than max cady is the overall story has also been changed around sam didn t testify against cady in court to put him in jail like in the classic version sam is now cady s ex lawyer who cady suspects of not doing all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to save him the overall story has been changed and i don t hold too much against it but the overall script is also weak all around other sub plots have been thrown into the mix that not only distract from the bigger picture they are also just poorly written the film also includes a few frankly absurd scenes and is filled with apathetic and even ridiculous lines that you can t take the least bit seriously these aspects take away from the dangerous and thrilling nature that the film is supposed to have but they have some help in this department as well now the classic version of cape fear was extraordinarily filmed with brilliant lighting and a powerfully effective suggestive subtlety combined with a barefaced brutality that delivered thrills when the film called for it and a sense of danger throughout its entirety however scorsese is unable to do any of this in his cape fear giving the film a cookie cutter early s look no sense of danger no suspenseful scenes and little style unless you count animating fire and the skyline style yeah there is some gruesome violence and some effort was put in to make this cape fear bigger than the original but it ends up empty and all shock but no awe if all that wasn t enough the acting isn t great either robert de niro being somehow nominated for an academy award for his performance starts off alright as max cady but he gets progressively worse until he begins to get nothing but laughs instead of scares by the end of the film the opposite thing happens for jessica lange and her performance of mrs bowden going from overacting for most of the film to giving a convincing display of fear and desperation towards the end as sam bowden nick nolte stays the same throughout the whole film beige juliette lewis who also reeled in an academy award nomination is decent enough in her role as danielle bowden but she s called upon to play a real stupid character and it s hard to really like what we see on screen from her this film seems to be often counted as one of the few good remakes and i can t figure out why i wanted to like it i really did i mean if there s going to be a remake of cape fear i d rather like that one too but i just couldn t containing nothing to be great on its own and being crushed by the unavoidable comparison to the original cape fear i found martin scorsese s cape fear to be a very bad film indeed the best things about the film are robert mitchum and gregory peck in their supporting roles go figure 
 look i know this may suck right now but pain is temporary film is forever whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come robert de niro this was initially a film for steven spielberg the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes and so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison robert de niro like jurassic park poltergeist and war of the worlds the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast the beast being the creation of the father a lawyer who failed to defend de niro during his trial in typical spielberg fashion the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins like oscar schindler robin williams sam niel tom cruise and virtually every daddy figure in spielberg land the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that spielberg so enjoys but spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to martin scorsese who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare the result is arguably the worst film in scorsese s filmography and ironically his most illuminating an artist s failures or misfires are often very revealing exposing the inner workings of their art when the story doesn t work the characters don t connect or the images don t sear we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core this the remaining carcass is what the director s cinema is about now cape fear is an impersonal film so we won t find any thematic connections to the rest of scorsese s filmography you already sacrificed me de niro yells but the films themes of catholic redemption are cookie cutter what the film does though is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on watch how scorsese s camera desperately whips back and forth how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention but more importantly watch how the film makes no spatial sense a showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound stage a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family s house doesn t seem to exist anywhere in particular there is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment the reason for this is that scorsese s camera always has to be bound or intimately tethered to his central character for the world around the character to make sense his camera has to be focused on the character resnais can take you around a french hotel welles and hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building cameron can give you a tour of the titanic scott can recreate an entire future cityscape lucas can give you an alien desert planet and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook close up mid shot wide shot combinations but scorsese can t do this there s no poetry no sense of tangible space in his films he s all about the character you break that tether you leave that boxing ring that taxi cab you look away from de niro and everything collapses he simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting which in a way is a prerequisite for action film making scorsese tried to rectify this problem with gangs of new york where the space and the sets become the central character but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of daniel day lewis the actor drawing scorsese s camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb even as a generic b movie this is an ugly vulgar looking film look at the matte paintings the inept attempts at tension the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown still we have robert de niro to pick up the slack de niro who gives his body over to scorsese like a tattooed christ gives the film its only great scene in an improvised romantic sequence with young a juliette lewis he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her a kind of symbolic rape the girl runs away both aroused and repelled by this man s interest but de niro s performance so deliciously over the top simply can t be imitated by scorsese you d need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like de palma to make this work but scorsese nope worth one viewing 
the plot it s not so original if someone saw l ultimo bacio there s nothing new a wealthy family in rome living everyday life that s is boring and false with everyone asking to others what they think about them really boring after an half of hour because it s simple to understand where the story is going to finish this because it s simple to see the moralistic view of muccino in this movie so even the hardest parts seem normal to summarise in the first minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said the family saw from a years old i don t like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations really good how muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and it s the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the begining perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it morante was intense and great as usual but unfortunatly on a bad movie 
 me and my sister have right now watch that movie we have laugh to the deaf can u imagine on covers there is nomination for oscar first musician have mix about different style of music and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character moves main character silvester do not fit in there he look like mexican tarzan russian soldiers are everything but not russian faces ok the main points airplane called charter painted in black what is an idea when rambo go to jump from the airplane but he stuck rope mix a girl the best scene is when she dies she means a lot to him he knows her for ages he cries for her o my god samurai how many arrows is he got his arrow bag is always full of the arrows i didn t notice a scene where he collect them but i have seen the scene where arrow stay in the vietnam solder head that is very important how many rockets helicopter can hold real one i have seen but rambos have hit about of them the main part what the russian special army helicopters do in vietnam after the war first scene when he enter into vietnam s camp his first idea was to liberate the refuge who is standing on the tree on the open space wow what an idea than again with the knife u can cut the iron wire maybe only made in vietnam mortar using for hit one running man o my god u americans really need to learn about the weapons do u know how much it takes to calibrate the mortar i think writer have been watching to much movies from ii world war 
whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about lucille ball especially her autobiography i ve never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi i could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages in all i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves if i were lucie arnaz and desi jr i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film the filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me 
usually any film with sylvester stallone is usually going to suck ass rambo first blood part ii was no exception to this the only movies that sylvester stallone were in that were good were rocky and first blood this film is extreamly unrealistic and boring it has action but not very good action i didn t enjoy watching it and i would never ever watch this again no wonder why it won the razzie award for worst picture i would give this a the only reason why it got the was because it had somewhat good action but not good enough 
i think it s time john rambo move on with his life and try to put vietnam behind him this series is getting old and rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly i am tired of hollywood making it seem like it was this is not the worst of the films concerning vietnam that honor goes to john waynes green berets in any case john rambo carrying around a cal machine gun taking on what seems to be half of the viet cong army plus a good many russians is an insult to watch what is worse is rambos cheesy speech at the end please oh yeah i heard they are making another one 
the ghost of the vietnam war has haunted the american psyche for thirty years now if not because of the fact that tens of thousands of american soldiers went mia in vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that america could be said to have lost many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves and the original first blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world as the saying goes first blood part ii on the other hand is little more than a fist pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore america can be both in victory and defeat stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular special forces commando while richard crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient where it all comes undone is in the script which didn t do any better when it was called missing in action and starred chuck norris what little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone as the filmmakers decide to paint a big s on rambo s massive chest the film picks up a little while after the end of first blood the film that is the novel didn t allow for the possibility of sequels in this mediocre follow up rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open air mine as he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with colonel trautman who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission rambo never one to back down from a hard day s violent work accepts and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be cambodia or thailand i forget which from there he is commissioned to seek out a camp where american mias are supposedly being held and photograph them his mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release rambo being rambo however has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications of course things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning rambo s work have more interest in making sure no american mias are found it is the age old conspiracy theory and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an american family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official vietnam war had been raging for of course with the jingoism that was inherent in american society during the s they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of russians together the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from rambo but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets arrows rockets and destruction about the only thing missing is the moment when rambo drinks from a grail like chalice and declares himself invincible to be honest first blood part ii is a well photographed and well choreographed action spectacle the hand to hand combat with the larger russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever the rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for americans to pump their fist to fortunately this fad of america ber alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as platoon began doing the rounds some of the kills shown here are quite creative despite all the problems the vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy the russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous only in a s action film would one see a law being used from inside a helicopter sure there have been action film clich s rooted in contradictions of fact but never this ridiculous before i gave rambo first blood part ii a one out of ten it is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny one doesn t even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are the only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved keep the tongue firmly in the cheek and it might be watchable 
i remember i loved this movie when it came out i was years old had a commodore and loved to play rambo on it i was therefore really thrilled when i got to buy this movie really cheap i put it in my vcr and started up man this movie is really bad sylvester stallone says like words in the entire movie except for that awful sentimental speech at the end and has the same expression on his face all the way and that stupid love thing in the middle it s just so amazingly predictable i just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else 
as an army veteran i was deeply offended by this film in my opinion it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon it was it would have been better received but it was taken seriously my many people especially overseas silly as it sounds wherever i went in europe in the late s people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film unrealistic hmm let s see a monosyllabic muscle bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pow s in a running battle he kills about enemy soldiers with an m machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats and he never misses running with a lb gun held up with one arm i could go on but i m getting a headache i gave this a only because it s slightly better than rambo iii 
an offensively over the top action adventure first blood part ii seemed to catch the mood of the us at the time of it s release in the mid s with right wing reaganism and virulent anti red feelings still not finished yet though the emergence of a certain mikhail gorbachev in the heart of the evil empire in moscow would soon render these types of films redundant even reagan himself eventually admitted this truism in that sense we can be most grateful to gorby not for his disarmament treaties with the us nor his policies of glasnost or even his support of democracy being restored to the eastern european countries in the former soviet union s backyard no it s the final diminution of foolish jingoistic bloated cold war adventures like this the first rambo film was hardly perfect though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline in this sequel any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly senseless plotting and incident in which rambo single handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped vietnamese and russian troops to rescue american pow s ten years after the conflict ended with the americans on the losing side perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box office success was to let many americans wallow in fantasy they may have lost the war but there was still unfinished business at hand and ludicrous comic strip heroics with a robot like hero killing virtually every red on sight with as much hardware as possible fulfilled such whimsically far fetched ideals this could have been entertaining on a superman spiderman level but sadly everything is played absolutely straight but that is not to say that there is no humour in the film sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind the action scenes though technically adequate never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts namely our hero rambo is always unscathed aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there despite the tons of explosives grenades gunshots etc going around him in between the mayhem what there is of a script consists of the dullest clich s and banalities stallone who co wrote the script with james cameron a long way from the exciting terminator made the previous year deliberately seems to have given the rambo character as little to say in understandable english and merely comes out with moronic grunts almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself maybe his colleague cameron was thinking of the terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character in this sense rambo seems even less of a human than the terminator did the rest of the cast do little better with good actors like charles napier and richard crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given and steven berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his russian kgb red army villain roles berkoff s overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing how come that sly managed to survive berkoff s electric shock torture to kill yet more of those red commie scumbags well credibility is never this film s strong point it is a work of fantasy comparable with the wizard of oz at least that was meant to be a fantasy and an immortal classic it turned out to be this is only a classic of the most dismal and indeed offensive kind and as for sly s climactic speech rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people eh by the way in the same year he also made rocky iv rating out of 
well what i can say about this movie is that it s great to see so many asian faces what i didn t like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead the white guy infatuated with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the keeping it real black cab driver plus all the coke shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel then again when watching romantic comedies you can t expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once the parents are the best part of the flick 
in what i can say was a theft of my time i was taken to see this movie and i must say what a horrible experience fay ann lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie larryjoe is obviously a shill reviewer the plot is thin to say the least the cantonese dialog is not funny see this movie at your peril david tang from shanghai tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate the banal plot attempts to compete with other rom coms out there and just blends into the scenery it was like watching paint dry in short this movie was a total waste of time and space i ve seen better movies on youtube 
as low budget indies go you will usually find that you get what you pay for and let me just say i didn t pay much for frightworld writer director david r williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer not a bad premise but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes the camera work tries to be too cleaver for it s audience by constantly using shaky quick cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us this becomes evident right off the bat as we are introduced to the would be killer and soon realize that the acting is the scariest thing happening after a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times yet the acting remains the same frightworld does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun house but with an extremely long running time it can t save the film from it s below average indie hell there is some mediocre nudity but not much for gore which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies fans of really bad b movies might find something of interest here otherwise don t spend a lot of cash 
very bad very very bad as a fellow who aspires to make be in or at least sniff the catering table at a movie set i find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made however this movie oh dear realizing frightworld doesn t aspire to anything more than crude exploitation an honorable thing in itself and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake and to be fair it is more entertaining than say red zone cuba but not by much so i won t try to critique just let me ask throw out some observations if gore is the point of the movie shouldn t you be able to see it if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment in a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll difficult i know but really there is a lot of talented videographers in the buffalo rochester area most you can hire really cheap get one who knows how to frame a scene just because you have someone who knows how to use after effects and other cool programs doesn t mean he should do so every two seconds kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time get girls who s tops we want to see taken off editing should help tell the story or set a mood at the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags a chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary it s sloppy some good things not all the acting was bad jack was pretty good and i liked acid once she started fighting back there was some neat imagery unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason acid poptart is a name that deserves a better movie i like the moxie of frightworld too next time now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts i hope all involve aspire to something better than colman francis upgrade at least ed wood 
with the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget truly independent horror film make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective the lead actress although attractive needs some coaching as she was particularly poor the major problem with frightworld is it s length at minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are relevant in places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour however when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to watch this could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal serial killer back from the dead movie with some judicious and ruthless editing in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut 
i remember when this piece of trash came out all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken barbra streisand years to get the film made well it couldn t have taken that many years the play only opened in eight years previously it made a broadway star of the great actress tovah feldshuh who probably should have been cast in the film but nooooo the great star barbra had to do it her way and with music no less this film is a total disaster from start to finish for one thing barbra was forty years old when she made it and she looked every minute of it there was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study torah and then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy i get the impression that streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make up she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl and as if that is not bad enough she gets involved with both her schoolmate avigdor mandy patinkin whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end and his fianc e amy irving who does her usual sleepwalker routine a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl i won t even bother to mention the wedding night scene then there is the music nine totally forgettable songs all sung by streisand via voice over presumably as a look inside her mind and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard i won t say that streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here some of the visuals are lovely patinkin s backside especially and she has a good eye for balance the problem with this movie is that she won t get out of her own way i did not believe her for one second in the title role she should never have added the songs and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes i was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty five minutes awful awful awful 
my personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every available surface in that room the whole notion that streisand plays a boy man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is the single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of willing suspension of disbelief it is impossible to do that in this movie 
this might be the worst film ever made and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study judaism the soundtrack is torturous featuring barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film and don t even get me started on the plot you will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible the rampant ego of streisand thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to oscar heights led to this disaster i m pretty sure the novelist isaac bashevis singer hated this film and never forgave streisand i can t blame him this movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of the sound of music being played backwards on an old turntable it s truly that bad i m amazed that anyone from streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended 
a seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating the premise seems simple enough yentl a girl interested in studying the talmud wants to go to school but only boys are allowed to study so after her father s death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in she does and becomes close friends with avigdor who is to be married to a beautiful woman named hadass hadass family learns avigdor s brother committed suicide and the wedding is called off yentl now calling herself anschel is then selected to marry hadass she does but it is never consummated yentl anschel and avigdor go away for a few days and yentl anschel reveals her secret to him the movie ends with avigdor returning to and marrying hadass and yentl going to america to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise the plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over hours long but there are several things that ruin it for starters there is the constant singing i can already hear the critics shouting yes i know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers but the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them the songs become tedious after a while and there isn t as much dancing as one would expect many of the songs are forgettable with no real memorable lyrics and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice over only one song stands out from the rest papa can you hear me it is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is so the songs really aren t necessary second streisand s makeup which can be seen during her scenes as a man the lipstick enhanced lashes and traces of blush are all obvious makes it hard for the audience to believe in the yentl anschel character that she is actually serious and fooling her new friends colleagues and even hadass into believing she is a man yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing there seems to be a contradiction as her character talks or rather sings of how she doesn t think she can pull it off but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men s clothing this means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can t see the other differences such as her actions which are clear giveaways the facial differences alone cannot be included as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn t have a beard or other facial hair nevertheless in the s if a woman dressed as a man but wore as much makeup as streisand s character did and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men s clothing it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town or even the country therefore the feminine makeup on streisand does not lend to the character s credibility and only weakens the plot if it was only applied to make streisand look more beautiful it should have been scrapped thirdly when yentl anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as streisand s and only when they learn the truth do they become a little wiser by now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom made vehicle for streisand to fuel lastly there are those who are fans of streisand who will find no fault with this film its plot or the songs to those i must respectfully disagree while she has excellent vocal and acting abilities i am not a fan of her style of singing however i have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals there are even some songs of hers that i like so i am not a hater nor have set out to bash her i have written this review from an honest perspective from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie several times even and has noted the problems within if streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn this movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities make her appear self absorbed and thus turn the film into a laugh fest unworthy of her fans or audience 
michael williams who works for bbc finds a somehow impressive italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled diabolical art a documentary but since his wife s mysterious death her daughter emily has been emotionally disturbed so he goes spoleto where the problematic picture is with her and her nanny jill and there is a countess who is also a psychic and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named emilia was executed michael doesn t believe her story but after that emily has hysterical spasm and jill is killed this italian film is of course almost innocently influenced by the exorcist but this one is much cheaper much simpler and in a sense much dirtier first of all it should be said this film is full of confusion for instance the story shows emily is a reincarnation of emilia but when emily sees her in the flashbacks she perceives her exclusively from a third person s point of view but if she is the reincarnation of emilia she should and must see the past from nothing but emilia s point of view confusions of this kind which the film has many are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly rather than ambivalent to specify its own quasi freudian theme namely pre adolescent girl s one way incestuous wish to make matters worse this film also has characteristic problem if not confusion every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and or believable living human regarding emily or emilia she is after all a child and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness and according to the freudian theory every girl wants to have her father s child ren in her own way in this sense emily is not exclusively pathological only her way of excluding other women from her father s love is problematically pathological but as i already mentioned this film per se is too cowardly to be freudian the problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as emily is and because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything down to earth and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way in addition special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable although stelvio cipriani s music is noteworthily beautiful indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap b film which can disappoint even the s italian horror film lovers 
i just don t see how a concorde new horizons film directed by jim wynorski and featuring the acting talents of andrew stevens and a puppet could be bad it just boggles the mind doesn t it well let s make no mistake about it munchie strikes back is indeed a bad film munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries for reasons not fully explained until the end of the film he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son the mom s problem her main problem at least is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks to the not so tiny tune of ouch she can t come up with the money because she just got fired ok just is the key word in that sentence what the was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck maybe it would ve been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it ya think munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess but there isn t a limit on the number of wishes you can make munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall munchie was borrowing it from the annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating a baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times sadly those dumb parents watching the game don t think it s at all strange hmm anyway i d like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is you ll be truly moved by the scene where leslie anne down playing the mother kicks a dog which is yapping at her your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer munchie strikes back s credits promised another film to follow entitled i believe munchie hangs ten to date the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force heh 
i think that it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like my girl my girl was a very good movie but it is ridiculous making a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters macaulay culkin as thomas j dies the story was over after the first movie i wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on that was senseless 
quite simply this shouldn t have been made it s predictable and clich d the on screen chemistry which made the first my girl so captivating is nowhere to be found here and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced the writing also leaves much to be desired some of the memorable lines such as earpeircing a barbaric custom are just shocking where my girl provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments like so many sequels my girl tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably maybe i m being hard on this film because of how great the first one was but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up surely this has to come close to son of the mask as being one of the worst sequels of all time in both cases the old saying rings true if it ain t broke don t fix it 
not to long after jeff jarrett left the wwf for good he spoke of that night owen hart and him where good friends and both nd generation wrestlers jeff first remarks i was literally pushed thru the curtain as my lifeless friends body was wheeled past me debra mcmichael steve austin s ex wife as well as steve mondo mcmichael ex wife as owen hart fell a video promo the ring was darkened as a blue blazer owen hart promo was played the fall and video of owen in the ring was never showed on tv there are a few news photos that got posted when they came back from the video promo jim ross was talking over a all we had was a crowd shot \ he stated that owen hart as the blue blazer has fallen and doesn t look good lawler then came back from the ring his face was ashen he told jim that the situation was very critical paramedics where working hard to revive him rock and hhh where going there match in a private room when another referee came in and told them owen fell at first knowing owen harts constantly being a prankster they thought it wasn t real but both later stated that the look of the referee face said it all in fact as he fell as mentioned in other post he yelled for the referee and ring announcer to move brother bret hart was a plane heading to la to do a angle on the tonight show he couldn t get any of the plane phones to work one of the captains got a message to call home something had happened when he landed in la eric bishoff was there told him what had happened and put him on a charter flight to kansas city to the morgue bret even later with owens widow martha went up to the top of the arena where owen was standing police found no foul play formerly closed as a accident most of the information in bret harts book as well as the book by martha hart 
this is one of the few episodes if not the only one with an indisputable error in its storytelling while handling the ralphie situation christopher states that he has heard about pie o my s death in the fire accident this is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that christopher knows from the beginning that tony is the one who must have killed ralphie there is however no way chris could have heard about the accident who should have told him and when by the time he is torn out of his delirium by tony s call nobody else was informed tony knows that which makes it even worse hearing christopher talk about pie o my s death could therefore only lead tony to the conclusion that chris himself has set the fire given the impressively elaborate writing process as told by the writers themselves on the dvd i really wonder none of them realized the problem there the story just doesn t work that way unnecessary to add that i m a huge fan of the sopranos otherwise i certainly wouldn t care 
this film is awful the cgi is the very cheap gray blob cgi the crocodile looks like a large gray smudge the worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive it is mostly a photo shopped cgi that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the cgi smudge across the screen this is one of the worst examples of cgi effects that i have ever witnessed and i have seen lots of the very bad sci fi channel movies aside from the terrible lack of special effects the cast is composed of the typical low cost actors who probably work as waiters waitresses at local diners while they wait for their big breaks perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the villains headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building and crushing kate the croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water no laws of physics can apply to this movie or the special effects at least there is honor among crocodiles 
 spoilers spoilers if one were to review the film based on the premise alone one might think that you were looking at an average animal orientated horror flick the plot is as follows a group of documentary filmmakers head off to an island in order to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing i live in south africa so it was released as blood surf admittedly this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it which if it were explored further could have improved the movie somewhat however this is not the case as the blood surfing part of the movie is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large salt water crocodile the script is absolutely terrible a good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by the crocodile which is a frequent occurrence in this film no one seems to give a damn the most anyone person did in the film was to merely toast the victim in a scene which was meant to be poignant but just ended up being laughable due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature another thing that really irritates about this film is the fact that they introduce characters who are totally superfluous to the film itself they introduce a bunch of pirates who can only be seen to be adding another minutes to a mercifully short film the acting can be said to be mediocre it probably would have been a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work from all in all there isn t one person who made a terrible impact on me every single person seemed to be a watered down caricature and in this way not one of these actors made any sort of impact on me the crocodile itself is said to be huge over feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they have provided for us in the film the crocodile s death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and contrived that it makes one s stomach turn with a huge cry of bravado the hero of the film announces that he has a plan which turns out be falling down a hill and getting the crocodile to impale himself on a luckily placed spike at the bottom of this said hill all in all i would say that this film is one which has to be seen for you to believe how bad it could be what probably seemed like a good idea at the time suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low budgetness which all served to create a truly awful movie 
this film is really terrible terrible as in it is a waste of minutes of your life special effects are so terrible the acting wasn t convincing its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about blood surfing blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a foot crocodile interrupts there holiday the sharks don t look real the crocodile is even worse and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature but the crocodile gets stuck and females flash it the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time a pointless terrible film thats not worth seeing 
who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie accidental killing of a security guard characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them and better a red toolbox of death please hypothermic weak thugs acting from hell stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy thriller voyeurism and female uhm rambo unbelievable and it s an insult to any thinking person do not watch walk away it s more horrible than you may imagine and on top of it all it s trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it s violence mrs montford shoot em up was fun and funny this is just pathetic and terrible good luck next time 
upon viewing tobe hooper s gem crocodile in i developed a great interest in the college crocodile niche of the exploitation monster genre i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts with ed writing the scripts and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer all we d need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer breasts and ren hoek pectoral implants while tobe hooper s crocky opus referenced his own movies blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies see if you can look past the revenge of the nerds sequel sets to find the allusions homages rip offs to jaws temple of doom indiana jones last crusade the convent godzilla and any james bond movie also try to find the ready for tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock i was disappointed the crock didn t get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism or crocky appreciation but the quasi captain ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach perhaps in the coming years we ll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset or hopefully a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero g monkey midget crocodile bloodshed all in all the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me 
oh cgi a blessing when used properly a sin with it s used by people who have no idea what their doing sadly that s not the only thing that s used poorly in this umpteen jaws rip off ok anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed things i like low budget horror movies and if there is a cute guy in said low budget movie i ll usually point them out so let s just get this out of the way right now this is one low budget horror movie i didn t like the acting for the most part is horrible effects laughable and the script rivals battlefield earth as the worst i ve witnessed this year as far as the resident cute boy dax miller bog wins that prize hands down this boy is hot and surprisingly he s not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt he can actually act well as much as he can in this odious film now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way let s get on with it in cliff notes version here s the story don t worry i ll try not to give anything away a film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers established cute boy and his buddy who surf with sharks unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island croc shows up mayhem ensues and people are eaten roll end credits as i said earlier this film pretty much blows it started pretty well but soon devolved into being silly and stupid a main character becomes lunch in a rather humorous way and our remaining heros utter one liners at the victims expense also if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water what s with all the sharks around if this thing can eat a foot boat i don t think a few skimpy sharks would stick around the fx is some of the worst i have ever had the displeasure to see the cgi is horrendous and they ve even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs attention filmmakers national geographic discovery store the croc hunter they know what crocodiles look like you obviously didn t reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film and what s with the pirate drug pusher gang did you just need another reason to rip off a woman s top it s funny how we get little sub genres in the movie world with alligator and it s sequels lake placid crocodile and now blood surf it now looks like over sized crocodile alligator movies should now get their own category at blockbuster alligator was good lake placid was good i even thought tobe hooper s crocodile was good blood surf sucked my grade d 
 spoilers this is one bad movie seriously acting in absolutely horrible the fx are dreadfull and the plot is down right awful but hey its so bad that its fun watching the script is so bad that its enjoyable you just have to cringe and laugh at lines such as i guess thats what you call crocteasing as the women flash their breasts at the crocodile i mean come on thats funny cause its so bad it has such horrible jokes that they re funny but after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap i really started to fall asleep trust me though the plastic croc foot stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crock tail well keep you laughing for a long time though i have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while figuring out what to do heh heh mindless movie which has to be nominated for the mst k line 
i never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious but alas i was wrong terrible acting terrible plot terrible effects the crocodile was awful and as for the stupid sex killing scene all in one that was a bad move from the word go it was truly shocking and that is not a compliment how can someone make this film watch it back and then actually say yeah thats a good movie people will watch that if you haven t seen it i beg you don t bother 
some might scoff but there is actually a real art with making particularly bad films this misses out on all fronts a bunch of young people women with heaving breasts and continuously wet t shirts naturally go to film blood surfing and end up running into a foot crocodile not only was the croc obviously fake but some of the props [notice the boat hitting the reef in particular] look like they ve come out of thunderbirds no good from start to finish don t see it 
 which isn t exactly a ringing endorsement overall dinocroc was a much better movie sure in that movie matt borlenghi played a complete wuss bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the dinocroc but the special effects in dinocroc were better the plot lines were better and the acting was better here are the problems with blood surf the killer crocodile looks like a kid s model with a retractable jaw the plot is ridiculous matt borlenghi co get shipwrecked on a deserted island in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group which was a complete waste of minutes of film and there s not enough croc time there are a couple of redeeming qualities of blood surf the actresses are pretty attractive and matt borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie but if you re on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one matt borlenghi killer crocodile movie skip this one and fire up dinocroc instead 
oh god i must have seen this when i was only or twelve don t ask how i may have been young but i wasn t stupid anyone could see that this is a bad movie nasty gross unscary and very silly i ve seen more impressive effects at disneyland i ve seen better performances at a school play and i ve seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo where they do nothing but sit in the water ignoring the children tapping on the glass the story is set in northern australia a handful of ambitious young people are trying out a new water sport surfing in shark filled waters it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water after they learn what they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years the best of which is lake placid and the worse of which is its sequel blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature but a good hour and a half of the viewer s life unless you really want to see it avoid blood surf 
 it s not like that big mechanical toy says a character early on commenting on jaws well blood surf would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the jaws series in other words the digital special effects of this movie are terrible acting and directing are not much better either they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble gum commercial than to a horror movie the attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre but for the audience too saying you liked this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap further destroying the poor horror genre 
sometimes i rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and or crocodiles are still getting made these days they ve been making these lame jaws copies since the s it s not like they re getting any more well liked the idea is still exactly the same so we have an animal that starts murdering people first it takes down some secondary characters then it starts attacking the main characters usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous who usually plays a specialist one of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow usually with an explosion then we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive or has laid eggs etc etc krocodylus basically uses the same overused ideas and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation unless you count the fact that the specialist is a captain in this one variation in that case your standards are pretty low it s funny that he s played by duncan regehr though he like totally used to be zorro hell i ll give it a bonus point for that 
fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid redundant pulp horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal crocodile directed by a disappointing tobe hooper and lake placid blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and on top of that it likes to exaggerate tremendously the saltwater crocodile supposedly is years old over ft long and it kills for fun during the film he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer dudes dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark congested area the only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location even though it s a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this the lagoons and nature looks marvelous every other aspect is simply disastrous there s a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable the dialogues are downright painful to listen to you won t believe some of the lines these actors have to say i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake they re not that stupid early in the film one of the characters refers to jaws as being a mechanical toy but the croc here looks at least times less real than spielberg s great white shark the visual effects in blood surf are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress i won t say too much about the acting since it s secondary in flicks like this the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast you guessed right blood surf is a very bad film so bad it becomes fun again but funny for a whole other reason than james hickox intended 
you get writers together have each write a different story with a different genre and then you try to make one movie out of it it s action it s adventure it s sci fi it s western it s a mess sorry but this movie absolutely stinks is giving it an awefully high rating that said it s movies like this that make me think i could write movies and i can barely write 
the special effects of this movie are especially for its time laughable and used in such an over emphasized way that you can t deny their terrible existance the acting redefines the term terrible overacting at the hands of meg foster and richard joseph paul where julie newman and andrew divoff just redefine bad spoilers the charm in this movie can be found in two things first is the excellent casting of carel lurch struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt who can sense where and when people will die and is always there the second are original finds the combination sf western is obviously original if terrible but other finds are more original like the gunman zack stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots though his acting falls short here overal don t see this movie except if you love that ol hunk o brutal carel struycken as any self respecting dutchman should 
i ve seen about four other japanese horror films and they weren t too impressive however i could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the way not here no way this is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening when he finds a suspect to question the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost then the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes up more than half of the movie bad enough oh no the film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who don t have much to do with the story i ve seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective not the case here also whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends for example there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and then it just cuts to another scene i m aware that this can be a dramatic effect that s definitely not the intention here it s just bad editing finally there s the ghost who just screams in a way that s not scary or unintentionally funny it s annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie all of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming then after one of them the movie is over at that point a wave of confusion swept over the audience as i could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued it was better than the whole film simply put avoid 
simply put this is the worst movie since police academy mission to moscow if you liked that movie you will probably like this one what were they thinking some ideas should stay just that an idea the fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal offense what was so bad about it i hear you ask one word everything cost to hire cost in time to watch minutes i want a refund on both 
i m usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance the only true upside to this film is cornelia sharpe looking rather attractive and the fact that this film is really short the plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film none of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone i m not sure why on earth sean connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this one the only reason i could see for seeing this film is if you are a die hard sean connery fan and simply want to see everything he s done save this one for last though well if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thanks for reading 
the movie had a lot of potential unfortunately it came apart because of a weak implausible story line miscasting and general lack of content substance one of the very obvious flaws was that sean connery who played an arab man didn t know how to pronounce his own arab name this may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details the quality of acting was uniformly well below average movie s solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song i don t recall the title overall it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was visibly miscast 
i saw one of the stage performances in denver and have never been less impressed the word vagina says it all a body part nothing shocking here i could say to my doctor my left arm has been hurting a bit after tennis or my vagina hurts after cycling with equal or more social commentary it could be the tricep monologues for all the entertainment or radical comment i heard the monologues were dull but delivered with drama the topics were outdated and i was alternately bored and annoyed once i think i laughed but apparently it wasn t when i was supposed to surely this isn t really a hit oh and spoilers there was a lesbian oh wait maybe not come to think of it and inappropriate fondling and a crack mama that about covers it 
this was one of the most boring horror movies that i have ever seen a college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at alcatraz trying to deliver a mix of nightmare on elm street and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad s music video this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story although being such a bad and often laughable movie dig those mullets and the terrible dialog it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of mystery science theater don t be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the winner of the silver scroll award by the academy of sicence fiction fanatasy and horror or that devo contributes to the soundtrack or that tony basil has a part in the film it is a giant disaster though one with a small cult following see the other imdb comments for this film 
well after three times through i still have no idea what this movie is about because quite honestly it failed to generate any real interest or concern but here it goes a bunch of too old to be teen teen actors dressed in horrifying latter s fashions did we look like that too decide it would be a really good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandoned alcatraz after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off poltergeist the evil dead and freddy kreuger in one fell swoop the dimwit even envisions himself being roasted over an open fire with some deformed freak slicing off strips of tenderloin good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget mine are usually pretty lame girls model space ships blowing things up with a bazooka etc once on the alcatraz island they find themselves in a slasher movie and meet up with tony basil who cannot help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew complete with a smoke machine for that s smoky haze infused light look which i kind of miss and such reminded me that ms basil helped choreograph david byrne of the talking heads for some of his videos and performances this of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie posed very little to actually think about it sort of happens and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the tv set off to the side but since the film isn t really interesting you ll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time the movie will keep ending and you ll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again dammit some s teen horror movies can survive such specialized viewing umberto lenzi s ghosthouse chopping mall it s killbots the hard to ignore night of the creeps and the over the top sleepaway camp all come to mind they are films that like them or not demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or t a and typos in your work as evidence that you were watching the tv instead of your keyboard i am sure that hell island as the british version i glommed onto is titled does indeed have some good stuff in there but frankly i don t care and nothing is more annoying that encountering art of any genre that doesn t inspire admiration some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it the film is content with simpering away whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance but no dice there is some offbeat production design going on the use of lighting is striking at times and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of s teen horror interested the rest of you be warned though you will wonder if you dressed like that in and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you aren t stuck with the damn thing movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days what with the world coming to an end all 
the summary provided by my cable tv guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is slaughterhouse rock is by far the worst horror film that i have ever seen a title previously held by urban legends final cut from its opening scene i could tell it s going to be really bad but i was so bored that i couldn t care less this film contains laughable acting especially by the guy who s tormented in his dreams incredible as in not credible plot twists and some of the crappiest music i ve heard and i m living in a period when the likes of britney spears and nsync dominate the air waves the biggest problem with slaughterhouse rock is that it s not funny one would a film as dull and boring and so not scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one liners here and there but no we have tormented guy s self centered friend trying to be funny but came across as annoying instead spoiler and please do tell me who in this crazy world is insane and self loathing enough to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night no one if you re going to make a horror movie at least make it believable this one is anything but 
i m gettin sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one line synopsis then end up being equal to what you d find in the bottom center of a compost heap who knows witchery may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast like blair and hasselhoff wink wink nudge nudge and the effervescent likes of hildegard knef i dunno some woman but on film it just falls apart faster than a papier mache sculpture in a rainstorm seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern seaboard and one of them a woman i d guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque tortuous ways okay right there you have a cross section of plots from the exorcist the omen ten little indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanic worshippers run amok line none of it is very entertaining and for the most part you ll cringe your way from scene to scene until it s over no not even linda blair and david hasselhoff help matters much they re just in it to pick up a paycheck and don t seem very intent on giving it their all from the looks of it hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with pam anderson and who can blame him and linda well who knows a celebrity peta benefit or pro am golf tour or whatever it is she s in to nowadays and the torture scenes ecchhhh you ll see people get their mouths sewn shut dangled up inside roaring fireplaces strung up in trees during a violent storm vessels bursting out of their necks etc etc sheesh and i thought mark of the devil was the most sadistic movie i d seen don t bother it s not worth your time i can t believe i told you as much as i did if you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches and yes blair gets possessed as if you didn t see that coming down main street followed by a marching band no stars witchery these witches will give you itches 
wow rarely have i felt the need to comment on movies lately but this one especially is begging for a beatdown let s start at the beginning first writer director susan montford puts kim basinger in the tired old victim role complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite montford s pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the christmas tree with no star is laughable when she goes out for some christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night della is furious that somebody double parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year she decides to do something about it so she leaves a nasty note on the car s windshield the next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall when she finally gets to her car the thugs confront her about the note a cop is killed and she runs and they catch up to her and she gets away and they chase her some more and on and on everything is completely predictable and uninvolving the thugs are not scary or menacing at all and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways this is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine why the bad guys don t just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me and once just once in a film like this does the leader of the pack have to die last what does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept much of the movie simply consists of lukas haas running around in the woods screaming della and the inclusion of joy division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting the part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when della exhausted and hurt cries out to the heavens where are you god where indeed was god when this movie was being made i give it a only because of competent cinematography and lighting and it s not as bad as btk killer the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film cheers 
humm an italian movie starred by david hasselhoff and linda blair i wasn t expecting very much to be honest and in fact i took even less than i was expecting it doesn t mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad now i only want to watch troll by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that 
this only gets bashed because it stars david hasselhoff well then let me bash it to compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays this film isn t too bad it has the beautiful leslie cumming she is super hot but can t talk very well there is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped she shows off her nice body linda blair does nothing here as well as hasselhoff 
this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered give it a 
a really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualities it starts off with pregnant linda blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks i m not sure she jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant the degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie she and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies on the island already are david hasselhoff and his german speaking virgin girlfriend you know how germans are said to love hasselhoff he s taking photographs and she s translating an esoteric german book about witches i think also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman i thought was their daughter evidently she was an architect and linda blair and the boy are the older couple s children i guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separately the hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isn t used to any great effect an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in german sometimes which he eventually records on his sesame street tape recorder people start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something some of these gore scenes are ok but not enough to recommend the movie though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut much of the scene is showing another character s reaction shots since we re not seeing anything ourselves the creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy looking wound of a mouth rapes someone he looked particularly nasty there s a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventions in the weird largely italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also aka la casa and ghosthouse that is it is supposedly a sequel to casa ghosthouse la it s not that s also a better movie than this one la casa and two were the evil dead and evil dead ii again unrelated to witchery and la casa and much better than those there s also a casa la aka house which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la casa series and the series house house house ii the second story the horror show aka house iii and house iv how s the horror show fit in there it doesn t really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more confusion oddly the horror show is also aka horror house and la casa is also aka horror house does your head hurt yet 
witchy hildegard knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted disgusting ways i thought i d seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire hildy is quite the prankster too she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire witchery made me sick it made my eyes hurt i was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever ever ever made by otherwise competent people until the finale i have to admit i loved the ending it involves a boy and his toy tape recorder cornered by linda blair looking fantastically possessed the scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie s over but you know that old saying if you ve got a great ending people will forgive you for just about anything 
 witchery might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the s but luckily enough it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices honestly the screenplay doesn t make one iota of sense but who cares when linda blair with an exploded hairstyle portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer who can t seem to get laid in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo sewn shut lips upside down crucifixions vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts the young couple is there to investigate the place s dark history the dysfunctional family with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are considers re opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex they re forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady an aging actress or something who always dresses in black starts taking them out in various engrossing ways everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window anyway the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin off of the evil dead the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film there s something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried 
witchcraft witchery la casa and whatever else you wish to call it how about crud a gathering of people at a massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel torturous methods photographer gary david hasselhoff is taking pictures for linda catherine hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble ee yor of the winnie the poo cartoon a virgin studying witchcraft on the island resort without permission rose brooks annie ross portraying an incredibly rude bitch is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and along with husband freddie robert champagne who is always ogling other women much younger than him pregnant daughter jane linda blair and grandson tommy michael manchester who just looks bored throughout probably wanting to watch sesame street instead of starring in this rubbish go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by realtor tony giordano s son jerry rick farnsworth obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet along with these folks is architect leslie leslie cumming whose character is a nympho who might help rose re design the resort the boat s captain is killed by the lady in black hildegard knef wearing her make up and lip stick extra thick and a storm is brewing the boat drives off by itself guided by the invisible power of the lady in black i guess with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort which is in dire need of repairs most of the victims before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension perhaps a type of hell or something where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage one victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney roasted as the others light the fireplace one poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck one fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge and bleed and neck s blood vessels burst squirting in hasselhoff s face one fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame blair s pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman s voice one is raped by this demonic man with a diseased mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering the film despite it s excesses is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of hasselhoff and blair who deserve better than this almost unbearable at times building little to no suspense clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable sure some gore is okay but most of the film shows victims after they ve been run through the ringer we do get a chance to see pregnant women who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs jumping out three story windows oh and the lady in black s reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see tommy has a little sesame street recorder which tapes the lady in black s mumbo jumbo chants obviously used for later for some reason the lady in black likes to visit little tommy he s not at all scared of her for tommy s just too bored to show any expression on his face much less fear need i say more this one s a real stinker ugh 
sorry but aside from kim basinger doing a good job acting scared this was one of the worst thrillers i ve seen in awhile logic is thrown out as young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard yet no one seems to notice then instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit i can t even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from retarded thugs carrying a red toolbox screaming for god to come help her and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others please trust me this is bad and a bit tasteless as well 
i would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash there are films that are bad but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you the sex sequences so shocking in its day couldn t even arouse a rabbit the so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night marxism the film is self consciously arty in the worst sense of the term the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle even the sound is bad and some people call this art 
an italian american co production co starring linda blair and david the hoff hasselhoff how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat well based on the uneventful extremely tedious and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so i would have said very easily thankfully however things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy a smattering of nudity too unfortunately my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material the hoff stars as gary a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie leslie cumming to a run down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project a book about witches whilst there frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginity his plans for nookie are scuppered however by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks robert champagne and annie ross their pregnant daughter jane blair son tommy michael manchester pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan catherine hickland and estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who have come to inspect the island s hotel after explaining their unexpected presence on the island gary and leslie are welcomed by the property s new owners and when a violent storm suddenly picks up making it perilous to return to the mainland everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building unfortunately unbeknownst to the hotel s new guests the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch hildegard knef who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life one by one victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs before meeting a terrible fate none of this makes much sense and the acting is atrocious manchester as tommy is particularly bad whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers which speaks volumes about the others but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore rose has her lips sewn together before being roasted alive in a fireplace jerry is crucified and burnt alive linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish freddie s veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood and gary gets stabbed in the back oh and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed again 
this movie is so bad it s good in an unintentionally funny way i couldn t stop watching it i was laughing so much it s like a parody of a romantic thriller except it s not a parody alexandra paul plays emily wendell an oppressed preacher s wife who falls hard for luke corey sevier a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison the only thing sevier is guilty of though is bad acting mind you he s no worse than the other actors you get the sense that the actors have no idea they re in a really awful film they re playing it straight everything about the film is bad the acting the script the love scenes the pacing the plot twists the choice of music the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous first the shootout in the church then luke s final words to emily i was howling with laughter evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison and we get to see plenty of his naked torso that s probably the highlight of the film 
this film is a pure failure i am a steve martin fan but even he can t save the tired idea and swiss cheese script think police academy and apply it to a military parody yuck i do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received and rightfully deserved it is extremely misleading i have often seen this film marked down to in the grocery store and now i certainly know why if only i could get my minutes back 
this was a disappointing movie considering the material army life is always good for a laugh and the stars this movie should have been a fall down laughfest it was worth a couple of chuckles at best steve martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that dan ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles where he might follow robin williams lead and someday win an oscar 
words can t describe how utterly stupid this story and therefore bad this movie is basinger del toro what were you thinking so there s a mall and its parking space is totally full basinger s character goes in to buy a cup of tea and some packaging paper when she comes out the whole place is so empty that nobody hears two gunshots fired nearby even though she lives there when she drives away from the baddies she goes to the most remote and godforsaken place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place come on i won t even go into the infamous red toolbox since other people have done that before let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by one this is so stupid without the least bit of logic i can only warn you watching it it s a total waste of time honestly 
maybe i m really getting old but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman that s me schultz lordy lordy what i would give to see the light firstly that phil silvers manic energy wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life if you will although it is possible that the series first titled you ll never get rich could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt bilko it is very hard to picture any other actor comedian in the business wearing those master sergeant s stripes such a strong identification is inescapable though not the same sort of career wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys like clayton more the lone ranger george reeves the adventures of superman and charles nelson riley uncle croc s block one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the s tv screen to the s movie going public is our collective memory without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals and their numbers were surely considerable even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles or even light years apart so as not to be thought of as a totally square old grouch please let s consider some other points right here today the th day of november in the year of our lord let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly years furthermore i ve enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko co stars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman after all it was the talents of guys like this and so many others alumni of nbc s saturday night and second city tv that kept the last quarter of the th century laughing but a bilko re make it just didn t click perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy always liked em but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby old guys like me so we ve already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately what s next howse about somebody doing hal roach s world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday ames and tv s st cartoon series crusader rabbit remember where you heard it first poodle schnitz 
ok i m not an american but in my humble scottish opinion steve martin is not never has been and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction phil silvers as sergeant bilko was a funny man no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies america has ever produced how anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the phil silvers character is beyond me to compound things the exercise was repeated in martin s unfunny attempt to be peter seller s inspector clouseau another abortive attempt in my opinion to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career some of your contributers say steve martin puts his own stamp on the character to that i would say balderdash his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of silvers and sellars will be treasured for generations to come
director jonathan lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past like greedy and clue this isn t one of them more akin to a police academy film than its inspiration it stars steve martin in the old phil silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors but the idyllic life of bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch bilko in the act nothing much happens really it s all quite dull it s not very funny martin dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort but they re all better than this and it s quite painful watching them work with such thin material 
i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i m well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this 
della myers kim basinger is an upper class housewife that lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband kenneth craig sheffer della gives all the attention to the twins neglecting their house and her appearance and upsetting kenneth on the christmas eve she drives to the local mall in the night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts and she does not find any parking space available when she sees an old car parked on two spots she leaves a message to the owner calling him selfish jerk when the mall closes della s car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks chuckie lukas haas the afro american huey jamie starr the chinese american vingh leonard wu and the latin tom s luis ch vez when the security guard of the mall protects her he is shot on the head by chuckie della speeds up her car trying to escape from the criminals however she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang she takes the toolbox and hides in the wood fighting against the gang to survive a couple of days ago i saw the trailer of while she was out and i was anxious to watch the dvd unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie and i am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clich s della myers is presented as an insecure and neglectful housewife and inexistent as wife the motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family she is chased by four mean criminals but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be the batman s utility belt therefore the plot is so absurd that irritates the gang of criminals is formed by the favorite clich of american movies with an afro american a chinese american and a latin together with an american lord to be politically correct kim basinger has a decent acting but their children are too young for a fifty five year old woman my vote is four title brazil enquanto ela est fora while she was out 
no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous as a bbc licence payer after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i m amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn t object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for seasons surly they can see it s lost all direction it s a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas paul bentley west yorkshire england 
seeing as i hate reading long essays hoping to find a point and being disappointed i will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible downright terrible and not surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review i thought i might agree with him seeing as he gave the movie the rank it deserved but was sorrowfully rebuked upon reading what he said i am quite ashamed to be taking the same side as someone who commented that the movie definitely lacks good looking females let me be the first to say wow that was definitely some serious in depth reviewing there my mind can hardly comprehend the philosophical musings about this movie seriously though a lack of good looking females shouldn t be considered an essential to a movie if you re desperate enough for good looking females you should really watch other types of movies not necessarily falling into the sci fi category 
as many agree origin is a beautiful anime artistically the music graphics and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works however if you are looking for more than this than i suggest looking else where the beauty stops short of its appearance and when it really comes down to plot and characters there s nothing special action is slow and minimal and the people are flat corny at times and do not act realistically not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there so in summary oh my goodness i ve never seen an anime as beautiful as this one and oh my goodness it s like poke people don t act like that it took a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization and unfortunately there s not even that much action to make up for that 
this was a rip off of the same garbage we had to watch bob saget host during the half hour before this dave coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as america s funniest home videos except with a hosts who have a combined iq of three tawny kitaen must ve really needed the money and coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes it was torture enough having to see him imitate popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on full house that one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a grade a wedgie coulier must ve needed to money to please alannis morisette while they were dating 
a previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad what the movie glorifies child molestation oh but sylvia kristel was naked in it so let s give it out of stars why not a full because the filmography was agonizing the child s looks of shock were unrealistic and the fat friend was irritating nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an american movie in featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman i happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had showtime to me even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an oscar i would still have to give the movie only star that tv s howard hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in wkrp is particularly ridiculous but don t take my word for it 
it is obviously illegal pedophiles pray on stuff like this how did they get away with making such a movie this movie is all summed up in one word sick where do people get off making and watching these kinds of films as i was watching the movie i didn t actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe if that actually sleep with this woman sorry if this is a spoiler to you but i would have rater not seen this where has the sanity of these people gone maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior i noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked this is a kid here and someone is asking something like this what is wrong with this picture 
one of the those coming of age films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids this movie has neither it is a poor excuse to let sylvia kristel s body double frolic with a dorky eric brown to make matters worse the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny sexy or dramatic laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for emmanuelle needs a body double as the movie went on and on i started to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and little miss millions that had sylvia kristel seduce jennifer love hewitt as howard hesseman makes us nostalgic for wkrp watch this to laugh at other people s stupidity or for ed begley jr s committed performance or to wonder what sylvia kristel would look like with jennifer love hewitt but i can give you an idea of your lesson stay away from movies staring sylvia kristel that are not emmanuelle 
the film looks super on paper a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross breeding gold especially with this excellent romcomic cast i m afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves adam brooks script may well be to blame but you d expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda instead the two ping pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around france jean reno co stars amiably as the cop with a heart and i guess wishes he was a star with a part mind you he went on to do those pink panther remake s so perhaps he was ok with this 
were i not with friends and so cheap i would have walked out it failed miserably as satire and didn t even have the redemption of camp 
this comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time and the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this or they were simply making it all up as they went along 
oh brother the only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total bomb from me is because it s at least historically noteworthy as the first three stooges film when they weren t yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny ted healy but even as a longtime stooges fan i d have to say that young moe larry and curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to mr healy s taller boss janitor they re not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on and off again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing most of this toothache deals with jack pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates baron munchausen here s a good example of the level of humor i object on what grounds coffee grounds his sidekick is none other than a young jimmy durante but even the schnoz himself is a bore 
strained comedy a sketch like revue which was initially a vehicle to showcase one time radio star jack pearl but is now best remembered as america s introduction to the three stooges actually larry curly and moe are billed alongside comic ted healy as ted healy and his three stooges although the supporting cast features jimmy durante who is completely wasted on dim material and zasu pitts the only audience for the film these days are stooges addicts and even they won t find much to applaud here incredibly loud and overbearing it shows how far hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication from 
this film s basic premise is a political cartoon i suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a feel good film on gender equality indeed a recent commentator stated it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do what claptrap no one man or woman can do anything they want to do and unfortunately demi moore buffing up for seal hell week in the early week bud s program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a seal is simply not going to make it so there is approximately an dropout rate in what is arguably the roughest military training program those are the ones who voluntarily drop out can t compete on a physical level suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can t handle the psychological harassment i never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived purported message of this film in the real world demi wouldn t last the first hours in this harsh and sustained physical training wishing alone won t do it skip this film as wishful thinking and better spend your time reading the warrior elite by dick couch crown new york for the best description as to what really goes on in this training ring the bell demi 
this is easily the worst ridley scott film ridley scott is a wonderful director but this film is a black mark on his career demi moore and viggo mortensen both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army very stupid and there is never one scene that is convincing in any way it is really not difficult to make a film such as this everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody the writers didn t have much inspiration either many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all and some brainless action i strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish i hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess 
hmmm where to start how does a serious actress like demi moore got involved in such crap first blood might be rated as bull t but this type of nonsense is just rambo with tits point of course if you are interested in the crapstory demi moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the navy seals that is the most stupid clich one i can think of you ll say gi jane is a great movie just the performance from viggo mortensen made this movie bearable but hell i can t think of demi moore being rambo especially not during the last useless minutes ridley scott doesn t deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights it s just brainless propaganda for the american army and to make it more attractive they dropped moore in it awful movie 
naturally i didn t watch gi jane out of choice i was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex girlfriends house gi jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario which of course it isn t the result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints restricting the amount of humour of which there is none or entertaining action scenes and soon becomes too serious the film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable gi jane fails where other action films succeed mainly because films such as james bond dirty harry and various others are larger than life yet never proclaim to be otherwise they are escapism and therefore entertaining gi jane tries to be real and fails this is a very disappointing film from ridley scott with a very non credible storyline unremarkable acting and the only reason i give it instead of is for some of the technical work 
after reading through many of the reviews i don t know what movie some people were watching but clearly it wasn t the same one i saw this movie is horrible the acting primarily moore s is just terrible the woman cannot act nice tits but she just can t act at no point did she come across as the actual character instead it was spoiled hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make believe with the boys and that s what this movie ultimately is hollywood make believe the training sequences are over the top the politics over the top the political correctness over the top the combat scenes you guessed it over the top your mission is to get in and get out without being detected so what do you do why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible of course oh g i jane you can be my wing man anytime the premise is good but as soon as hollywood gets a hold of it we end up with top gun with tits what more is to be expected from commercial us films anymore not much i guess 
watching this movie was a waste of time i was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie but i resisted i don t know what ridley scott intended but i learned that in the army women get as stupid as men they learn to spit to insult and to fight in combat and that s also a waste of time in my opinion and anyway what the hell was that final scene in lybia are they still fighting gadafi or is it that it s easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger 
i ll be short and to the point this movie was an insult to any one with a room temperature iq sorry liberals feminists etc no women will ever be a seal they can forget about the draft or being in combat too ain t going to happen you see hard as it is to understand or accept men and women are physically different regardless of the fact it is reality cannot change things in order for people to avoid having their feelings hurt men can t give birth or breast feed babies oh i forgot about san franfreako women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in a combat or other physically challenging situations how many women play in the nfl or nhl lastly i couldn t give a bloody hoot in hell if what i just wrote upsets you come to think of it if this does upset you that only warms my heart more i didn t write one thing that wasn t the truth this imbecilic movie is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy one at that 
demi moore s character in the movie was selected for the seals because of her looks that was a bad start and the movie went down from there the plot was totally unbelievable the will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough this movie did not convince me of a woman s physical ability to perform the types of tasks required trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone s intelligence the differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting 
why would a person go back to a person who kicks them in the teeth not once not twice but over and over again this film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse not just forgive it but fully accept it gosh no wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years i obviously wasn t embracing my inner masochist as bucatinsky s writing debut there are many wonderful aspects to this film however in order to justify the reunion of eli and tom more character development would have been helpful we are never acquainted with eli s masochism in fact we are led to believe that he is not a masochist although tom s psycho emotional sadism is highly evident 
i think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed why all the american animators thinks that the kids this days wants stupid gi joe versions of good stories the looney tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history but they weren t created to be xtreme i mean come on tiny toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without loosing it s original charm but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that only wants to create a cheap idiotic show that kids will love because hey kids loves superheroes right the whole show is only a waste of time in which we see the new versions of the looney tunes but this time in superhero form this doesn t sound too bad but the problem is that this show tries too hard to copy series like batman the animated series or the new justice league the result bad copies of flash the road runner or superman who else bugs bunny the problem is that looney tunes weren t meant to be dramatic the were supposed to be funny as i said before this series sucks and many people wonders why anime is taking all over the world this show tries to be dramatic and action packed but that s something that few series and anime are able to do if you want to see a good upgrade of an old show watch tiny toons that s an example that it s possible to bring back to life old characters but with a good story and respecting the original roots too bad that show is already dead another corporate wise decision i suppose 
 well chuck jones is dead lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions an american drawn anime knock off style and give them superpowers but sir don t we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this much less don t dump all over their original creators dreams yes and those shows make us a bunch of cash and we need more but won t every man women and child who grew up with these time less characters be annoyed hay you re right set it in the future make them all descendent s of the original characters and change all the names slightly but not too much though we still need to be able to milk the success of the classics well that s the only reason i can think of why this even exists if you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved looney toons then it looks like an ok show but then there is already the teen titan s which is the same bloody thing all the characters are dressed like batman they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains they have superpowers only difference is they sort of talk like the looney tunes and have similar names and character traits this kind of thing falls into the it s so ridiculous it s good kind of category think of the super mario brother s movie and batman and robin if you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons check this out if you are of the younger generation what this thing is actually intended for and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness then run with it and enjoy if you enjoy this cartoon i don t have a problem with you it s the people who calculated this thing together that i am mad at you know how they say piracy is like stealing a car this show is like grave robbing they might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon shoved them on a display dressed them up in err pirate costumes and charged money if this show wasn t using characters ones that didn t resemble the looney toons in anyway whatsoever that have already made the studios millions then this would be fine but no for shame warner brothers for shame if i saw this thing as a second gag on an episode of the simpson s or family guy i would love it as it is i just can t believe this was ever made i would bet anyone that of the people who work on this show hate it but whatever it doesn t really matter in years this show will have been forgotten while the originals will live on forever or at least until the world ends coming snoopy and the peanut gang are back and now they have freaking lasers and can turn invisible can charley brown defeat the evil alien warlord zapar tune in and see 
they probably should have called this movie the map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are the only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character this of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the immortal hills cemetery come on now couldn t they have shown us just one of the death scenes we hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don t get to see anything some how i bury the living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better i movie such as i spit on your grave or i drink your blood 
this movie could have been great cause its got a somewhat fascinating premise but it never rises above sheer caricature the acting is severely flawed and there were moments where i cringed so severely that i thought i was going to fall of my seat in the theater never and i mean never watch this godawfull piece of danish cinema has been getting a lot of good pr the recent years but if this piece of crosses the border i m afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie this movie is the reason why i chose to register here i really felt i needed to steer people away from this piece of my sympathies go out to the people who already went to the cinema to watch this
the good thing about this that s at least fresh almost no movies about dance music and the club scene if even made hit the cinemas and it radiates lots of energy too from the music to the portrayal of ibiza but the main problem is that it can t decide what it wants to be although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of this is spinal tap the makers also realized they wouldn t want to play copycat however it fails grossly on the jokes because it s not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped and it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to minutes so why not edit it down to the production department and cinematography still try to save the day e g paul s home in a strange way and unexpectedly so it s all gone pete tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of almost famous especially the scenes with beatriz batarda offer some acting power conclusion it s a mess it somewhat entertains at a basic level but you better spend a night in your favorite club 
creepy lascivious wolf the young red is wearing full make up and extremely short shorts robe got about minutes through and realized it could be a pedophile s dream come true the up beat music sounds a lot like something i d hear at a strip club i actually think this movie is a sick joke it s not a family movie gross glad i was watching this with my daughter i don t want her to think it s normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together very bad very sad it s sold as a family film joey fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it and what s with advertising it as a special effects spectacular the effects do look low budget gawd awful 
relying on the positive reviews above we saw a free screening of this last night now i know that filmmakers plant positive reviews because there is no way an objective individual could have written these destined to become a cult classic the theater was packed apparently with friends and families of the production crew because only a few of us walked out by the first hour the songs were the most literal i ve ever heard in a musical don t take the short cut honey there s a wolf in the woods debi mazar s eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing fortunately most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines now whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive instead we get joey fatone ex n syncer living up to his last name as he s not aged well he s not exactly lithe with his extra pounds and junior high school quality makeup and out of tune singing seriously this guy was in vocal group the rest of the actors are semi adequate but can t do much about the unimaginative script you know it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time see under pixar on the positive side the virtual sets looked nice and were well integrated with the actors and it wasn t as offensive as crash 
the creativeness of this movie was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left out a good story line only to substitute with horrible special affects this movie seemed to be focused on amusing children but couldn t even accomplish that many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies but this movie is no where near that fortunately this will be another film easily made and easily forgotten this movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie anyone who has a shred of respect for films should avoid seeing this movie at all costs 
spencer tracy and katherine hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew this guess who s coming to dinner rip off was actually in theaters along with sidney poitier and katherine houghton these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with director stanley kramer s master piece this present day rip off is a joke so a white guy from an overly stereotyped italian family in rhode island brings his african american girlfriend home insert gasp here to his grand father s funeral his family members reactions were of course predictable this movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave do yourself a favor and rent the original take a pass on wake 
model chris mccormack margaux hemingway is brutally raped by a teacher chris sarandon of her sister kathy mariel hemingway he is brought to trial but goes totally free he then rapes kathy objectionable and sick rape film this movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape what it is is a badly written and for the most part badly acted drama it purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face to be totally honest however hemingway s acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had the trial scenes were boring and predictable and the movie just went too far when year old mariel is raped thankfully that wasn t shown i do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when margaux grabs a gun and shoots sarandon dead but seriously having a young girl raped is just revolting acting doesn t help for instance margaux was no actress she was certainly a beautiful woman and an actual model i believe but her acting left a lot to be desired it lessens the film mariel was just ok but this was one of her first films sarandon does what he can as the rapist he wasn t bad but the terrible script worked against him i do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in some women stood up and cheered when sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people i found this boring simplistic and really sick a all the way 
manipulative drama about a glamorous model margaux hemingway who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician chris sarandon to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister played by real life sibling mariel whose music teacher he is while the central courtroom action holds the attention thanks largely to a commanding performance by anne bancroft as hemingway s lawyer the film is too often merely glossy but also dramatically unconvincing the jury ostensibly takes the musician s side because a the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together what the f she was clearly tied up what resistance could she realistically offer the second half of the film involving sarandon s rape of the sister which curiously anticipates irreversible by occurring in a tunnel is rather contrived mariel s character should have known better than to trust sarandon after what he did to her sister but margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately the climax in which sarandon gets his just desserts with margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante is however a crowd pleaser in the style of death wish incidentally ubiquitous italian movie mogul dino de laurentiis was behind both films it s worth noting how the two hemingway sisters lives took wildly different turns this was the film debut of both margaux s career never took off despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here while mariel would soon receive an oscar nomination for woody allen s manhattan and interestingly would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real life playboy centerfold dorothy stratten in bob fosse s star with the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in chillingly the hemingway family had a history of suicides notably the sisters grandfather celebrated author ernest who died of a self inflicted gunshot wound in 
ben masters kyd thomas dream lover plays a sort of mike hammer character a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy curves of good looking gals kyd makes one big mistake when he stops morgan fairchild laura cassidy eva bomberg arizona summer from getting beaten up and raped kyd takes laura home to his pad and when he wakes up she is out on his patio eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home by the way kyd sleep in his bed and laura slept on the couch for this particular scene laura is mixed up with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between kyd and laura all said and done this is a lousy picture and i purchased the dvd for only and i really got ripped off 
when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isn t bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting clich lines and sub par camera work i didn t have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse just your average movie 
i read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the film noir criss cross i found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film this movie is a neo noir since it s modern day and it s in color two things that purists would make it be disqualified for film noir status the biggest negative to it however wasn t the cinematography that was fine but the muddled storyline hey some of s dashiell hammett stories were similar but i didn t care for some of those either the filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes no wonder it was the keep up with this story it was ridiculous what happens is that by the minute mark their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore i know i didn t 
oh brother after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all i can think of is that old peggy lee song is that all there is i was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the u s i was too young to get in the theater although i did manage to sneak into goodbye columbus then a screening at a local film museum beckoned finally i could see this film except now i was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it the only reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its u s release millions of people flocked to this stinker thinking they were going to see a sex film instead they got lots of closeups of gnarly repulsive swedes on street interviews in bland shopping malls asinie political pretension and feeble who cares simulated sex scenes with saggy pale actors cultural icon holy grail historic artifact whatever this thing was shred it burn it then stuff the ashes in a lead box elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings but if it weren t for the censorship scandal it would have been ignored then forgotten instead the i am blank blank rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films i am curious lavender for gay films i am curious black for blaxploitation films etc and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that naughty sex film that revolutionized the film industry yeesh avoid like the plague or if you must see it rent the video and fast forward to the dirty parts just to get it over with 
i am at a distinct disadvantage here i have not seen the first two movies in this series although i have seen a lot of larry cohen films fans of the series seem to think this is a good film judging it on it s own it was pretty boring you never get a real good look at the maniac cop s robert z dar face but what i did see was pretty grim the death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film not to give any thrills maybe if i saw the nc director s cut i may be more impressed the ending with the car chase with z dar caitlin dulany and robert davi was pretty intense best part of the movie 
i always thought people were a little too cynical about these old andy hardy films a couple of them weren t bad modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty so goody two shoes movies like these rarely get praise nonetheless i can t defend this movie either you can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story watching this you just shake your head ask yourself how stupid can you get this is cornier than corny if you know what i mean it is so corny i cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour and a half the story basically is andy mickey rooney trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some d butante from new york city as if that was the ultimate people were a lot more social conscious in the old days you d hear the term social climber as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life it s all utter nonsense of course and looks even more so today however it s about as innocent and clean a story and series there were a half dozen of these andy hardy films made as you could find also if you like to hear judy garland sing then this is your ticket as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into andy s heart oh man i almost throw up even writing about this 
i must say this movie is a mork and mindy knock off when watching it i got the chills i even wet myself a little when that korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time any way back on track chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of christmas past this movie is so bad i put my new born child in a box and left it in mr norris mailbox he can raise my kid i m not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck norris is a karate expert ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life 
the shame of it there i was comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn bouyant in the hope of another splendid muppet night of entertainment what did i get disappointed how can the muppets go from the sublime christmas carol to this the humour was dreadful the songs were worse than country and western and that s saying something and the plot was as confused and poor as blind pew i think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting treasure island a short tale such as christmas carol is perfect because you can weave the muppet high jinks around it here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun where do the muppets go next how about muppets wizard of oz 
if you re going to look after a child make sure they don t live anywhere near a graveyard especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her friends but our long haired heroine oblivious to all the signs shacks up with her family the nortons which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast s tendency to talk even when their lips aren t moving and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths but enough of that domestic animals are being sacrificed old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won t shut up during any scene even the quiet ones oh and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on in fact it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather smelt what they d signed up for and gone awol yes i know it s hard to get into movies these days but this sort of starter point is not one on your cv you d want if would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill laurel barnett and another almost equally as bad by the charisma free child actress rosalie cole the next dakota fanning she ain t the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax this involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on but back up a minute earlier on they were in the car and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it so do they stay where they are safe no of course not they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she s having a nervous breakdown finally the film closes it doesn t end it just goes to a grinding halt the main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood as if nothing horrible had happened but my dear viewer something horrible has happened you have just sat through one of the most lamebrained boring horror films you re ever likely to see and lost minutes of your life you ll never get back just think years from now on your deathbed what you d trade an hour and minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family sadly it s already too late for me don t you make the same mistake 
this movie was seriously awful the acting was the worst it was worse than a student film super cheesy and i think the worst actor was the old lady at first i thought to myself well it s an old movie then i remembered that that is no excuse i ve seen older movies with way better acting and such the music was terrible to it was really choppy the editing was poor most of the dialog was out of sync overall this movie doesn t even deserve a i only watched it because i was so bored and the movie hardly entertained me it was just laughable my dead grandmother s left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this 
there were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies but this film certainly isn t one of them it s a shame the child isn t better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes we have the idea of a vengeful child which worked so well in classic films such as the bad seed and then we have the central zombie theme which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie the plot is basically this young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge as you do this is all well and good except for the fact that it s boring nothing happens for most of the film and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore it s not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it the film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish there s really not much i can say about the film overall as there isn t much to it the child is a dismal seventies horror flick and i certainly don t recommend it 
a little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside this little girl rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night the premise of the film has a new young lady coming to rosalie to take care of her she is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and imagine the suspense here experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks from there she walks to the nearest house and discovers mrs whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about rosalie and her family the earnestness exuded by the mrs whitfield character has to be seen to be believed well the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well they all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school none of these people can act as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on pause to remember lines and have all the conviction of a paper bag the director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary it takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends but by that time i didn t care the murders are not convincing either and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend s farm with the people and things on hand there that all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don t learn one darn thing about why rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are cheap doesn t even begin to describe the budget here with it basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods someone lent the director a couple old cars too no special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make up there are so many guffaws ridiculous moments to list but i will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved watch the gardener s body well after he has been slain len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life the dying scene at the end where the actress playing rosalie is killed she looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method how about the guy playing roaslie s father giving us a cranky poor man s andy griffith the scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot the child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of s cheese if you will this isn t a b film but more like a z film with producer harry novak making some money on virtually nothing 
i m not going to say that this movie is horrible because i have seen worse but it s not even halfway decent the plot is very confusing i couldn t really figure out what was happening and where things were going when the movie was over i was left scratching my head i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it i felt like i was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie with little or no transition between the two character development is very shallow i couldn t figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone i couldn t tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk stoned mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them this film seems to be based around stereotypes to it s credit they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band which should make character development easier since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean stereotypes are easy to depict which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters this film on the other hand uses stereotypical characters left and right but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation i guess that s ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that i really didn t get a chance to know any of them so i never really missed any of them and last but not least was sadie s singing it s awful the music backing her up is not prize winner but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from sadie s vocal cords i swear that there s one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least minutes i seriously thought i was going to have to turn it off during this howl a thon as a whole this movie is confusing characters are ill developed georgia s acting is wooden and stiff sadie s character is yanked from one bad situation to another with no back story or explanation the music was unbearable and i can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain 
any film which begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf can t promise much as for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was yrs ago well i was there and it just wasn t like that ok every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film like youngsters raiding the kitchen at night but you can t show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those shall we say naughty traits each kibbutz had its own problems but hardly any kibbutz had all of them the views of israel were great i still remember my youth in that garden of eden called the emek valley yes and the acting was good too so you see it wasn t all black just a wrong portrayal probably on purpose too 
i saw this movie just now not when it was released and hailed as best picture of the year here in israel and to summarize everything right now i will just say this is not a good film this is dror shaul s second feature film and i have to admit that his first and the tv drama he made before this picture are much better further more this is his first attempt at directing a drama the early works were comedies and were funny and effective the first thing you have to know if you ll ever see this film israel of the st century hates the kibbutz and the values it represented since the formation of the state of israel the real situation of the kibbutzim is very dire and some of them disappear one by one the kibbutz hebrew word for collective was a sort of village for members only where the values of equality and socialism were the dogma for everyday life with the change in social values with time it seems now that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed locked within the dogma rules with no ticket out the entrance of capitalist values and way of life in the s and so far made it very hard on the kibbutzim to survive the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that but i regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutz once it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment but the film shows the opposite that the kibbutz with it s socialist dogma was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism your individuality is the most important thing you must place yourself in the center and no one else but you is the matter this is the philosophy the film stands for and that s just it s first sin if you disagree with me on the political side i m sure you will agree that the acting the tone of the film it s script and it s direction are the four sins that follow the film has no real visual text and none of it s shots is something to remember it is also very delicate a delicacy that is no more than artsy fartsy attempt to provoke emotions which do not surface not in the film and not with the viewer it brings nothing but boredom can someone please explain why this film won so many prizes maybe because it shows that israel is in line with the rest of the world hating socialist and human values or maybe it shows that israel is a delicate place not giving in to dogmas and fanaticism that we are basically very human and good people capable of emotions especially when they are fake ones just like capitalism expects us to be or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of israeli cinema in recent years a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the jewish state no matter what the answer is it s not a good one not for the world not for human values and not for the jews 
this is the worst movie i have seen for years it starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way i thnik when is something going to happen in this film and the the acting is worse the ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop mark wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks 
there just isn t enough here there a few funny spots but not really enough i was very disappointed because i love stupid movies i was expecting this to be a hidden gem it was not it was a hidden turd the whole time i was watching it i was thinking geez i could do better than that and i m a moron don t believe the few good reviews i was suckered in by them at no point did i laugh at loud maybe this was funny or cutting edge in but man it fell flat today this movie had promise it just didn t deliver on it maybe if they rewrote it a few more times i cant fault the actors they weren t the best but they just didn t have much with which to work this movie failed because of threadbare writing sorely disappointed 
mark pirro s deathrow gameshow of is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts but occasionally very funny nevertheless this movie could certainly have been a lot better the acting is terrible and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times but the concept is funny and it has some hilarious moments in the near future the year game shows have changed chuck todean john mc cafferty hosts a game show called live or die in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives and for money candidates who fail get executed on the air using many different methods such as guillotines electric chairs and other more bizarre devices of execution followed by applause from the cheering studio audience the show is of course more than controversial and chuck has made lots of enemies deathrow gameshow is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects and the acting is terrible but it is without doubt fun in many parts especially if you re a fan of dark humor you haven t missed anything if you haven t seen it but it is definitely funny and a good time waster 
i rented this film to see what might be a bloody non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action drama that makes kickboxer look like die hard lou and reb are in vietnam and as lou saves reb from the gooks he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever the vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard i swear lou is now brain damaged and reb and him live together and own a bar super homoerotic lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and reb goes on a killing spree to get him back there is no good fight scenes at all the punches are two inches away from a person characters personalities change in matter of seconds one guy is a bad and in the next scene he s good the acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental frank stallone sounding song that would make you sick i hated this film 
i don t know what you guys are inhaling but please stop this movie was complete trash macaulay culkin as kevin mccallister was lovable cute sweet loving and extremely fun to watch he had that innocence but at the same time he was strong as well this new kid alex annoying as all hell just a blatant ripoff at trying to match culkin s charm and grace failing miserably at that the villains complete crap harry and marv they were such an entertaining on screen team they were comedic they were humorous and just made you really want to root for culkin even more which is what a good villain is suppose to do these guys joe pesci and daniel stern absolutely perfect for those roles on the other hand in we have new idiots that just bicker and again try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains not saying they were horrible but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining more on the corny side actually then we got the actual movies part and classics memorable perfect to watch around christmas and brings a wonderful christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions it makes you fall in love with the story and care about the characters simply memorable and close to being masterpieces part masterpiece of crap enough said all and all i don t know why people like this i think people really don t know what a good movie is anymore its a crappy sequel rip off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid that i wish the robbers would of at least beat the crap out of run run away from this garbage and lets not even start with part 
i loved the first two movies but this movie was just a waste of time and money for me and the studio i m still wondering why they made this horrible movie the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car that can go into another house are ridiculous joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movies were so funny but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny believe me this movie is just a waste of time 
home alone is one of my least favourite movies it s the cream of the crop or s if you tend to be more cynical as it ranks up or down there with stuff like battlefield earth and flinstones viva rock vegas in fact it could even be worse than those two since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity this just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling no other movie has made me cringe in pain now i will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious first off the plot is ridiculous it revolves around a chip in a remote control car that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it dumb stuff the action that ensues is similar to that of the other two home alones with boobytraps and all but watching these boobytraps being executed is rather than being funny incredibly unpleasant to watch i didn t laugh or even so much as smile once rather i cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid the bird rather than providing comic relief was unfunny and annoying the acting as done by a bunch of no names ranges from poor to atrocious there is not a single good performance here alex d linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid while the terrorists act and judging by their movie credits look as they ve been hastily picked off the street and well that s it i can see some people saying man it s for the kids don t dis it man well man kids may like this but they can get a hell of a lot better see monsters inc and toy story before even considering getting this out hell even scooby doo and garfield which suck see those reviews for more are better than this so in short this is an irredeemably atrocious movie this was clearly recycled for the money as it almost completely rips off the first two the only thing is it completely insults the first two as well no human kid or otherwise should find any reason to see home alone ever it s that bad stars
this is the worst ripoff of home alone movies that i have ever seen watch part and two but don t let anyone say that this is better than the first two i mean really you don t make a movie then make a sequel with the same characters and actors and then make another sequel with different characters and actors i mean it would have been ok if this wan t a home alone movie but they did make it a home alone movie culkin is too old now so you re suppose to stop making sequels goodness this movie makes me sick buy part and 
the first home alone was a decent enough film the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting this one tries to be original and succeeds to some degree of course the formula is basically the same so it s like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot the new score is quite bad though the new setting traps piece was if nothing else interesting and different especially compared to the grand score of the first and the almost but not quite as good score of the second it almost makes up for it by using some pretty good non original music but it s just not the same the plot is fair and somewhat original to the franchise but it s still basically the same movie as the first two with worse acting and a less impressive example of the scary character turning out to be good the acting is mostly unimpressive the characters are mostly caricatures the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones and they make fun of spy stuff which is almost criminal given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are and how precious few of them are cool the fact that there are more of them and thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films and it doesn t work the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too adult and serious for a children s film and there was a sexual joke or two though that isn t the first time in the series it s also unnecessarily complex as is the plot in general i could follow it but i doubt a kid could some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid the animal stuff is generally not amusing there are fewer siblings which should mean that those there are get developed more but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films all in all just not particularly good or worth watching unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon y violence i recommend this to huge fans of the series only 
this is the worst brain damaged ultra cheap super stupid silly pointless piece of trash i ve ever seen an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre if you think that ed wood s plan is bad well let me tell you looks like citizen kane compared to that one special effects again plan is star wars acting thor johnson is al pacino so it s beyond bad really but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies it s for you i m a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies the price corman poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff but with star creatures they descend right down to the z level of course my out of works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun the guy playing an indian chief is great so have fun and enjoy if you can 
some things need to be clarified the picture of mark ferris is not the mark ferris who starred in this movie i know that because he was my dad please remove that picture also mark ferris was the writer at least one of them i have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again it has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy that would be great the movie wasn t all that bad and trying to compare it to todays world of star wars and other high tech sci fi s it futile if you watch it just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films 
 let me start by saying that i understand that invasion of the star creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci fi films of the s i understand that none of it is to be taken seriously the problem i have is that none of it works a parody should be funny and this one just isn t not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile in general i am easily entertained but i couldn t find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creatures i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning the two stars make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable a water hose they can t control that gets them both wet these two come off as bowery boys wannabes why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me after the less than illustrious beginning the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences dancing indians vegetable men decoder rings and other assorted unfunny bits it s all just a complete waste of time i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girls that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures 
gloria victor and dolores reed in space girl costumes i love sci fi i even love cheesy s sci fi but this film is really really bad and not in a mst k kinda way virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best hip cat impression of abott costello chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi such as in cat women on the moon but it can t in this case this film requires a mute button and fast forward feature that said i could watch gloria and dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so 
this was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early s usually on the am movie or one time on the pm channel big movie and still another on creature double feature when local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time it was of the time a couple of low rent abbott and costello wannabees frankie ray and robert ball are in a platoon of soldiers half a dozen guys in army surplus remainders who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation and wind up encountering extraterrestrials they first go into bronson canyon to what would be later the famous batcave on batman and encounter the remains of a dead carrot monster later in the cave they re chased by a living carrot creature basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head with sparkly things on it and ping pong ball eyes two of them complete geeks ray and ball are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being examined by space amazons dr poona nooo kidding and professor tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini uniforms we were too young at the time to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this examination scene would more than suggest turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster are stranded on earth with a ship that s well hidden and are trying to return to their world the film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when eric von zipper and his crew from frankie and annette s films were the height of b film drive in comedy so it only seemed a natural to jump on the bandwagon for some quick bucks for some reason i only thought i d imagined seeing this film to start with no i really saw it and when it was released on restored dvd i was assured in my memory the comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid but whatever the budget is non existent which is a minor miracle when you think about it that it even got made and we can talk about a restored version here and now over years later the payoff is the girls who want to learn about love and kissing and the upshot is the geeks which all of us were get the girls and love wins out it s just goofy and silly and for the locations has nostalgic significance 
i appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film but this is too much in the end they look like a bunch of loonies this film is one of those finding yourself s plots i know the film is made in a lot more of clint and girl friend movie this movie is a 
this is a bit of a first for me the first time i have ever been disappointed in a tim burton film pota isn t a bad film great sets costumes and the odd great performance but it could have been made by any off the shelf hollywood director the pacing was very odd the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end by myself and the cast tim roth was excellent probably the only pleasure in the film come back tim 
ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left but ever hopeful i stayed and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time acting was ok but the story line is so transparent and weak the script is about as lame as it could get but again stretching out the ten minute plot doesn t leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue 
i had always been a big lynda carter wonder woman fan so when the sci fi channel ran this movie i had to see it i was bitterly disappointed this is a wonder woman movie in name only she doesn t wear the right costume [she must have refused to or had ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a poor man s james bond there s none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i e the superhuman strength or determined will it s just one long bad dream i don t even think cathy is all that attractive anyway i wouldn t waste your time on this 
i ve been reading posts here concerning wonder woman s costume for this tv movie it should be pointed out at the time the movie was made she wasn t wearing her traditional outfit the producers were actually sticking to the comic book writer s conception of ww for the early seventies as for the movie itself i have to agree with many of the other posters here snoozefest i was a kid when it appeared on abc in so i was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero yet i was so engrossed with the plot i stopped watching it three quarters into the movie of course i wasn t at the right age to appreciate cathy lee 
it seems that salvatores couldn t decide what to do with this movie some of it is a very weak thriller and i say very very weak some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters both things have been tried in psychological thrillers but in this case the movie cannot hold things together due to poor superficial scripting bad acting and a too dark too dull cinematography i d say that salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot on the whole a b movie hardly worth your money vote 
considering how much money was budgeted for this film you would expect more from the story as a whole this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched there was no real advancement of anything character development minimal plot advancement maybe enjoyment none i m not sure what points were even trying to be made if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys american cia bombs everything that doesn t agree with our opinions all capitalists are corrupt and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death have at for those of us who realize that it doesn t take killing off a good guy to make a point we ll stick to other movies in summary this was a horrible attempt at an ocean s style hide the plot so person has to think movie because not only do you not know what s going on nobody who made the movie did either home alone was a better cinematic piece 
absolutely the worst film yet by burton who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs a miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film this is the kind of movie where every time something happens you ll be sure to hear someone shout out he s lost his gun or whatever it is to let everybody know carter is really awful and so is wahlberg who can t play this straight and be convincing very nice effects and photography but poor music in the john williams mold by burton s crony elfman heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch phrases from the first movie very poor results if anyone else out there also saw sleepy hollow they will probably have noticed as i have the declining quality of burton s films i ve heard that this particular project was produced by others and that burton was brought in as director in which case his judgement should be questioned but i think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip the evidence is there in the films in sleepy hollow he couldn t decide what kind of movie he was making whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie and the population of british character actors chris lee etc made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film those are never scary as horror fans know the movie couldn t succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic and no style had been developed to smooth the two together planet of the apes is much the same way and the result comes off more like total recall or tango and cash than like sci fi he s also fallen into the rut of so many other big directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience word to burton if you re out there pick something and do it straight or use some style to peice it all together as in mars attacks or beetlejuice or you might as well retire because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going 
we gave up at the point where george clooney s character has his finger nails extracted we were not squeamish having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like to say this film was incomprehensible boring pretentious twaddle would be to over praise it how did people manage to sit through this confusing slow depressing pseud s corner of a film let alone nominate it for an oscar clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him what was he thinking oh and what was with those subtitles did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that sentences left hanging in mid air the film was hard enough to follow without that as well i pity the cast who obviously did their best with the material available 
i saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources i would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this film i am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the roles for the political buff s and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite good but to the average movie watcher this film is awkward very boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entrance fee see it if your ready to focus on every minute detail or politics interest you don t see it if you actually like watching films 
ok hollywood is not liberal obviously i m lieing because it is im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie this movie was anti bush anti middle east anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad fist off i will give credit where credit is due i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage the cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good the plot was impossible for me to decode however i have been tested and have an iq of but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what the story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story which it very well may be i have no idea exactly what was going on which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique if you cant dazzle them with brilliance then baffle them with bull s 
exceedingly complicated and drab i m a bright guy but this was just too much for a tired brain it would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing probably better for the us market gc himself hinted that this alone did not supply his oscar and you can see why still the sand dunes are pretty the nail pulling is nasty the attorneys drunk dad is a mystery the cricket is good to see very difficult to write the required ten lines on this despite it being over hours long thank heavens they shortened it admittedly we don t get to the pictures much but the last film we saw walk the line was times better and i don t really like johnny cash my wife says george still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there s that am i nearly there yet how about now
imagine turning the american national anthem into a cartoon throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you d find yourself with almost an exact replica of this film i remember seeing this when i was younger i made my mother rent it from the video shop about times the story itself isn t too bad it s just that any marxists watching would certainly have something to complain about if you don t like america you won t like this film 
i saw the mst k version of deathstalker iii and loved the movie so much even unmystied that i decided to watch the entire series of deathstalker films i bought i and ii and settled down for a laugh nothing about deathstalker i was funny on any level and when the credits rolled i was embarrassed and regretful that i had bought it too much ugliness and nudity i guess either ds was a much cleaner production or mst k really edited a lot because i expected something similar i e stupid and carefree and simple i was wrong even at it seemed a waste of money i didn t even open ds as i will return it tomorrow now i ll probably just throw away this dvd as i can t return it and no one wants it including myself so really don t bother with this one even the nudity lots of it btw is uninspiring and icky 
this is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers eating pizza and laugh at unfortunately for me i found myself watching this one alone my friends and i rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one it was due back and i figured that it was a waste not to watch it so i did and i was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is now i love bad movies quite a bit and i probably would have liked this one if the hero wasn t so utterly loathsome the entire movie i was hoping that he d put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him he does very little heroic things in the movie he s a beefy disgusting stupid thing he has less redeeming qualities than the villains do and what was it with all the naked chicks i mean i love naked chicks just as much as the next guy but this movie went a tad overboard in that department well anyway if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting hero then i m sure you ll like this schlock of a film 
i had to give this film a because it s that bad but don t make this think that i didn t enjoy watching because i laughed and laughed and i even had a few questions so half of the time i was laughing half of the time i was saying what in the hell is going on or why would someone do this et cetera i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects the s style nude scene battle dialogue nude scene and the way that the warrior s swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses and there s some crappy model effects those aren t supposed to be real trees are they and i still don t understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he a friend of mine told me about these movies and i thought i would give em a try and i basically liked the film as people like ed wood films i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be i look at it in my own hilarious way so don t let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie it is i just liked it for other reasons it s much much worse than evil dead so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it which came into my mind a few times i guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks have some friends around and laugh at this film maybe this is a bit harsh but i don t think so rent it and you ll see yo 
 or more precisely so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it james sbardellati s deathstalker of is certainly one of the most awful productions the sword sorcery sub genre has brought along but it is highly amusing the acting is terrible the plot is pure crap and the effects and photography couldn t be more amateurish but it is the bad acting the cheesy effects and the many errors that makes this movie so hilarious spoilers ahead deathstalker rick hill is an extremely strong and skilled warrior one day a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation a sword an amulet and a chalice in order to free the country from its brutal ruler the evil king and sorcerer munkar obtaining the sword is quite easy but the amulet and the chalice are in munkar s possession fortunately the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county s most skilled warriors fight each other until death the winner is then to take the king s place of course the king doesn t want anybody to take his place an therefore he has planned to kill the winner instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation but also to save the old good king s gorgeous daughter barbi benton from the claws of evil munkar luckily he doesn t get bored on his way to the tournament since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior kaira lana clarkson in the meantime the film has many great incredibly stupid and funny scenes some of my favorite scenes include deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword the head that falls down however is not that guy s head the falling head has a red goatee while the guy beheaded by deathstalker had dark hair and no beard when the character of female warrior kaira lana clarkson is introduced she is first seen in a black robe hiding her face and body deathstalker s traveling companion oghris richard brooker fights her and during the sword fight her robe under which she is of course topless opens exposing her breasts her breasts are the first thing we see of lana clarkson even before her face the last warrior deathstalker has to fight in the tournament is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig evil munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest he feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers there are many other unintentionally funny hilarious and great scenes the acting is terrible but barbi benton and the late lana clarkson are eye candy and although i described this movie as unintentionally funny i sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is there is a fair amount of gore and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained deathstalker is an incredibly awful movie but i still highly recommend it people with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives 
deathstalker is directed by john watson and it stars rick hill who is some kind of body builder and famous of that if i have understood right the plot follows as deathstalker hill tries to get something back from the evil lord and he has to travel to the lord s cave he meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey and the settings are very close to tolkien and of course conan the barbarian this is a rip off of huge success of conan and even though this is very stupid film it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies there are no many cinematic merits in this film couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating but what deathstalker concentrates to show are nude females and huge muscles of hill females are usually helpless victims and very stupid too so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists the fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull and the monsters are not either anything special and all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done but what did you expect from low budget effort like this this tries to be as great as conan but fails pretty miserably as i said this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else this belongs to the category it s so bad it s great deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be and as a turkey film i appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys enjoyable ones of course if bad films are your cup of tea then try this and have fun but if you don t understand enjoyably bad films then stay away and if somebody can t stand large amount of nudity then stay away as well there is more nudity here than violence and due to these scenes the film has an r rating otherwise this could be some safe pg family film 
this film s kind of like conan the barabarian but with more sex rape and murder there is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don t do a good job showing it which is a shame because it could be a decent story richard hill gives a solid performance in the lead role as does the villain who sadly didn t appear in anything else of note the fight scenes aren t too bad either i love the way deathstalker lets his sword drink the blood of his victims and there s plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout all in all not good but not necessarily that bad either 
woosh man what can i say the opening scene maybe we see a bunch of mongoloid barbarians with bad make up jump off the walls of some ruins they sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl the dude runs off the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her then the dude still on the run sees a horse and tries to steal it suddenly a blond god like looking hero with a bad wig appears saying that s my horse the mighty deathstalker just made his appearance the mongoloids arrive deathstalker kills all of them including the dude on the tunes of some rather inappropriate mexicanos western score this is supposed to be a swords sorcery flick so what s with the arriba trompettos and then goes up to captive girl and exposes both her breasts he starts to rub them and captive girl seems to like it she starts liking her lips and caressing deathstalker just when they are about to get down to it this old dude appears interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for deathstalker and a possible perfect ending for a short film now tell me isn t that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie or any other male viewer would say this is going to be one hell of a good movie the plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony deathstalker must obtain the sword of justice and use it to steal the amulet of life and the chalice of magic from the evil sorcerer munkar aside from decapitations dismemberment random bloodshed retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights this film also contains a massive amount of t ts a shots i initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies i could count after points not even halfway into the movie i had to give up counting it was distracting me from the rest of the movie and the rest of the movie was worth it totally crazy stuff check out this mutant cat worm like creature munkar has as a pet and which he feeds eyeballs and fingers and here s an interesting question what would you do if a man in a woman s body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife the answer is simple you slap him around a bit take away the knife and then try to rape him then you discover that he s actually not a woman so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room it works out well i tell you deathstalker does it too and the deathstalker way is the right way deathstalker is a wonderful movie really as pointed out in other comments the villains are vile the women are delicious there s blood sex violence rape and tasty chicken there s a completely pointless tournament which just features a bunch of barbarians beating slashing and hacking the crap out of each other my favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer used to beat a poor contender to bloody pulp and my favorite contender undoubtedly was that one brute with the warthog head reminiscent of the gamorrean guards from return of the jedi i won t reveal how the movie ends but just prepare to ravish in delight when i tell you a way dismemberment is thrown into the movie s climax and of course there s a wonderful display of ineptitude throughout the whole movie see a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road and the next point of view shot shows him being dragged over grass no road see that awesome tattoo on the sorcerer s head magically change sides within the same scene on shot has it on the left side of his head the other on the right well after all munkar is a magician it s that or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like continuity simply don t exist as much as i enjoyed this and as much as i am looking forward to the other installments in this series i do have enough shreds of decency left in me to not let this movie pass i am prepared though to give it the maximum amount of minimal points just so i could be able to deduct a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow deathstalker might be a superbly fun trashy sleazy conan rip off it also is an abominable movie 
rich ditzy joan winfield a woefully miscast bette davis is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical allen brice jack carson looking lost her father eugene palette is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot steve collins james cagney seriously they crash land in the desert and hate each other but sigh start falling in love this seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because cagney and davis are in it they were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas not comedy and this movie shows why the script is just horrible there s not one genuine laugh in the entire movie the running joke in this has cagney and davis falling rump first in a cactus this is done three times only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated as it is they both do their best with the lousy material cagney tries his best with his lines and davis screeches every line full force but it doesn t work carson has this what the hell look on his face throughout the entire movie probably because his characters emotions change in seconds only palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles but all in all this was dull and laughless a real chore to sit through this gets two stars only for cagney and davis acting and some beautiful cinematography but really it s not worth seeing cagney and davis hated this film in later years and you can see why 
this film was a big disappointment i take the opposite view of the critics this is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors here the actors bette davis and james cagney are simply not up to the level of the material clark gable and claudette colbert were every bit as big as davis and cagney and look how it happened one night turned out an all time classic with a very similar story davis proves that she has no talent for comedy good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted davis one note performance oozes petulance but none of the nuances of colbert s acting in it happened one night cagney who was a great comedy actor just seems out of sync with his costar davis the script provides some decent lines and gags but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy part of the problem is the soundtrack which like the delivery of davis and cagney seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy jack carson who played similar roles throughout his career has more capably handled very similar material in a fairly typical supporting role eugene palette delivers a respectable performance in a slightly different role as an old west relic harry davenport is very good but in one of his poorest performances william frawley is quite irritating his character s constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony i really love every one of these performers and it is a shame that as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than the bride came c o d 
 this movie has absolutely nothing good about it the acting is among the worst i have ever seen what is really amazing is that everyone is awful not just a few here and there everyone the direction is a joke the low budget is hopelessly evident the score is awful i wouldn t say the movie was edited brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase it combines serial killings voodoo and tarot cards dumb dumb dumb it is not scary at all the special effects are hopelessly lame laughably bad throughout the writing was appallingly bad the cinematography is real cheap looking and very grainy sometimes and the camera work is dreadful again what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are cheesy 
i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good looking horror movie to watch over the new year s weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent b grade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semi interesting so i rented it what a mistake don t be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent i m thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo inspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murder story sound somewhat good well it is and this movie could ve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhs quality camera and i m assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someone s bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didn t hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just bad overall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent b movie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it could ve been alright but this movie fell flat on it s face if you re expecting something semi decent you ll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate d grade horror flicks otherwise you ll probably want to stay away from this straight to video garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess 
i own this movie i bought it for at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some indie type movie research since i had just finished my own feature and was editing it now when i feel down about my skills as a first time director i just sit down with a plate of cookies and severed within minutes i feel great i hate to down talk another filmmaker so i ll just use constructive criticism find good actors take the time it really helps when shooting video over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post closeups are better for video when an actor enters a scene wait a bit before having them speak so that we know what s going on and who s talking never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it damn well worth the the true horror would be getting the reviews severed has here on imdb and you have to give these guys credit they did get distributed 
hm while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive at best special effects all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years severed ranks among the worst i ve ever seen i m never sure who the protagonists are all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen in the dance floor murder scene all in all i don t really like the movie because only the first minutes are enjoyable the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion which i can t remember anyway 
this is one of them movies that has a awesome video box but has wired camra work and unknown actors that speak with bad dialogue its so dark when the killings happen you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understand the only star in this is wcw`s vanessa sanchez tygres in wcw before it folded and she is a good actress i like low budget film especialy ones that has errors because they are fun to watch but severed unfourtunatly isn`t one of them this movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is no blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent severed 
i went to the movie as a sneak preview in austria so didn t have an idea what i am going to see the story is very normal the movie is very long i believe it could have cut to without causing any problems to the story its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more ashton kutcher was very good kevin costner is ok the movie is speaking about the us coast guards how they are trained their life style and the problems they face as there aren t much effects in the movie so if you want to watch it then no need to waste your money and time going to the cinema would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on dvds 
after looking at monkeys oops apes for more than one hour i was feeling like one too i was an ape spending money on this movie please people hold you money in your pocket and go see some funny movie like bridget jones s diary 
there s nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland and robot wars does deliver sure the acting is lousy the dialogue is sub par and the characters are one dimensional but it has giant robots the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period they are certainly not as polished as today s standards but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures so it has aged fairly well its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime and it does have a certain tongue in cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction 
this movie doesn t have an awful lot to do with it s predecessor robot jox this must be also the reason why its most common name is robot wars and not the alternate name robot jox robot wars robot jox was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots battling each other in the near future this concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides isn t very original or cleverly written a shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watch just like robot jox this is a b movie but with as a big difference that it s just not a very good one perhaps this also has to with the fact that robot jox got made during the s when b movies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it even though the movie got released in this really can t be said about this movie it s just lame badly made poor looking and not exciting enough it also has an ending which leaves you thinking this is it that s all what the movie its story is lacking is good clear main plot line really perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story some action or likable main characters seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie all of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially don michael paul is annoying as the main character who behaves as if he s god s gift to woman and mr perfect who can compete with anyone weren t they even simply able to get the actors from the first movie for such a futuristic movie with a concept of having large battle droids in it this movie surely is lacking with its action had they put some more and bigger action into the movie the movie would at least had been a more entertaining one to watch instead now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically every way imaginable you can better watch a mighty morphin power rangers episode for some more action and likability 
if there is a hell it contains a screening room in which grand canyon is playing over and over again on an eternal loop one would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors danny glover alfre woodard kevin kline mary louise parker would help make up for the presences of mary mcdonnell whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity but no apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from mcdonnell the entire affair is pretentious overblown insulting if you are deaf or know anyone who is be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous tdd scene grand canyon is filled with obnoxious self involved people but never gives us a reason to like understand sympathize with or even tolerate them with rare exception they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without there s no plot to speak of no character development these people won t ever develop no break out performance and the most arch writing you ll ever encounter in a film the best thing about grand canyon its title this is one large hole of a movie 
 i am curious yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile it doesn t matter what one s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level as for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic nc that isn t true i ve seen r rated films with male nudity granted they only offer some fleeting views but where are the r rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia nowhere because they don t exist the same goes for those crappy cable shows schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight and those pretentious indie movies like the brown bunny in which we re treated to the site of vincent gallo s throbbing johnson but not a trace of pink visible on chloe sevigny before crying or implying double standard in matters of nudity the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude and the same cannot be said for a man in fact you generally won t see female genitals in an american film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica this alleged double standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women s bodies 
this movie could have been minutes long if it weren t for all the bickering between son and father very predictable both male stars need a good slap in the face would you like some cheese with that whine two chuckles and a headache i can understand why the mother left her hubby after years i don t know how she lasted that long the first minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing i had never paid the to watch it the movie didn t flow well and was painfully long i kept watching my watch hoping time would fly faster it didn t the script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space on a positive note the scenery was pretty fall being my favorite season the car the ford was also quite nice this movie gets an d rating approaching an f
this should have been a movie about sam and his wife the glorious peter falk and equally glorious olympia dukakis that would have been a movie worth seeing instead it s a paul reiser vehicle with a little falk thrown in the wonderful elizabeth perkins is also in this movie but you d hardly know it i presume reiser is under the impression that he s a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle he s not even more galling is that reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best women character actresses on the screen today and then shoved them all into his background dukakis does not show up until the last minutes but when she does the screen glows the story is about falk and dukakis really but we re subjected to a pointless silly preposterous road trip in which reiser gets to show how very cute precious and oh so deep with psychological insight wrong he can be for instance in a restaurant scene that i imagine reiser had hoped was cassavetes like there s a laughably false confrontation between reiser and falk that is so patently ridiculous i was embarrassed for falk 
this is the single worst movie i have ever seen let me say that again this is the single worst movie i have ever seen it had all of the ear marks of a bad movie continuity errors bad writing bad acting bad production value bad music i thought that there were a couple points to horror movies the first is that it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you this movie gets and f in this category the second point is that when a character dies or something bad happens to them we are supposed to care this movie gets an f in this regard as well the first story a woman gets mauled by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her the next story an ocd guy dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend of his oh and then there is the horrific nail biting story of a bad roommate come on could you pick topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house being anal retentive and having a roommate turns out all of these stories where hallucinations virtual reality induced by a doctor who in turn uses it himself wow stupid let me explain something i enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are i couldn t do that with this one it was utter pain to sit and watch do not under any circumstance watch this movie you will regret it 
this movie still chills me to the bone thinking of it this movie was not just bad as in low budget badly acted etc although it certainly was all of those things the problem with this movie is that it seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer and doing it with great success what i want to know is is this supposed to be a horror movie i mean it s definately horrifying but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be i could see the first segment trying to be horror and failing but what the hell is the second segment it s just annoying the third segment is like watching an artsy student film which amazingly enough makes it the least painful segment it s an atrocity that this movie isn t way low on the bottom so get your votes in people i know some people gave this good reviews but well they re lying in a sadistic attempt to trick you trust me it is impossible to like this movie the only benefit of this movie is an amazing life extending effect it feels like you ve been watching this movie for years after only the first half hour has passed 
imagine a woman alone in a house for forty five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens then this goes on twice more the writing is flat and lifeless and jokes unfunny and the bad acting keeps you from caring about any of the characters even when they battle wolf packs and get beaten up by fraternity goons anyone that ranked this movie higher than a two is not fully sane 
here is one of those movies spoiled by the studio s insistence on a happy ending conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes it would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity the talented barbara stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life brent as usual is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of gig young playing a character named gig young someone mentions gig young and then who appears but gig young the actor worth seeing though far below what it could have been 
born raised and educated in scotland i was appalled at this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more nor less than a cattle rustler worse yet the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another by implication or verbally to view it one would think that th century scotland was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals lange was a joke acting as the young mother at age but liam neeson was even worse taking a bath in a scottish loch is not commonplace as they portrayed him but it did give them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were save your money and watch pinnochio 
how does a scotsman in a kilt make love in the bonny purple heather very very carefully now i have the distinct advantage over many other of the reviewers in that i was born in scotland far too many americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously it s a joke people four legs good two legs bad as orwell had it jessica lange has an accent that the wells next the sea amateur dramatic society s production of brigadoon would turn down liam neeson apparently popular with the ladies wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose great grandmama once stepped off the train at edinburgh waverley and the auld enemy where would the scots be without them to hate and blame for everything messrs roth cox and hurt should be ashamed for indulging in such racist stereotyping robin hood prince of thieves seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison and at least alan rickman was funny 
this was a new alltime low among westerns the writing is excruciatingly bad characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed and tobey maguire shows us the flip side of his talent sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism ride with the devil is among my five worst movie experiences ever a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect 
i basically picked up this movie because i had seen kitano takashi s brilliant remake of zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale which also starred asano tadanobu these two movies are worlds apart zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and subverted traditional samurai movie clich s gojoe goes off the deep end in the other direction first off i hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie you cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior says almost every character in benkei s presence yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself instead of character development we get bloated boring gory battle scenes asano s character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and doesn t know what he is doing there i know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of asano s appeal but this movie doesn t serve him a lot of the camera movement is nauseating there is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and i felt like vomiting the ending is ridiculous and rather anti climatic its too bad that really good samurai movies aren t being made in japan nowadays with this type of budget the colors scenery and costumes were great but the rest is just a loooong waste of time i would rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth 
sogo ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions but gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival a scion of the genji clan the film making has the main hallmarks of a low budget production including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages the kind you might find in an under produced dorama the monk benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards gojoe bridge at night but he doesn t realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time but which could earn him enlightenment there s no absence of ambitiousness however in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film making style a disappointment 
i am curious is really two films in one half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with political socialism whatever the director s intention the two don t really mesh together the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics there is a bizarre mixture of political war rallies dr king serious political interviews flopping breasts and pubic hair the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie other than the interesting sex scenes you ll be bored dry watching this film unlike many other reviewers i think the nude sexual scenes are overdone for what it is if you want to see real porn i m sure there are better choices the pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is i think the cast did a fine job however they played their parts believably there is little of the over the topness i m so used to seeing in the american films during this time 
all i could think of while watching this movie was b grade slop many have spoken about it s redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events yet really the techniques used as many have already mentioned were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole as far as the plot is concerned it was lacklustre unimaginative implausible and convoluted you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action looks can only carry a film so far the action is poor and intermittent a few punches thrown here and there and a final gunfight towards the end nothing really to write home about as others have said bad movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are bad you revel in that fact this film however is a void it s nothing furthermore if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way requiem for a dream trainspotting fear and loathing in las vegas and candy are just a few examples though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like go overall both serious and funny and halfbaked on a final note the one possibly redeeming line in this movie delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from lock stock and two smokling barrels to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by loaded is vile overall i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie 
this movie is just like every other dutch movie so if you enjoy movies such as turks fruit and de kleine blonde dood then you might be okay with this one even though those two have much better stories and actors zomerhitte starts strong enough but even that one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline there s a lot of nudity but me and others just could not find that girl attractive the dialog is laughable as we did a lot to the annoyance of other movie watchers and some of the scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else like a random scene in which an owl rips somebody s eye out it has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once later in a sentence saying did you hear what happened i was there the only reason i gave it a is because some of the places they are at look nice that s it and the reason i saw it was because we went to the sneak preview here in holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews you pay less money then for a regular movie and you don t know what movie it is that you will be watching all you know is that it s a new movie that s not yet in the theaters my advice is to stay far away from this film if you really want to see a good dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek 
edward montagne s tattooed stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor instead it s a poorly acted witless look into low budget and uninspired film making the plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish john miles who had a rather thin resume in the industry grins and guffaws throughout and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government made filmstrip about driver safety the movie anticipates shows like leave it to beaver and father knows best in its unnaturally wholesome view of new york in why the viewer doesn t even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie the only thing the movie has going for it besides its brevity is the excellent location shots coordinated by william steiner the low budget of the film works in the cinematographer s favor as the viewer is treated to well framed shots of new york city s interiors and expansive exteriors unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles i suggest watching practically any other movie 
very low budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in central park and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm although released by rko this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution the cast and crew with a few exceptions among them a young and uncredited jack lord director edward montagne and cameraman william steiner are comprised of complete unknowns and it shows the performances are universally sub par and wouldn t pass muster in a high school training film the direction is stodgy and choppy and as mentioned previously there s no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors however despite the film s many shortcomings it does have a few good points the location shooting in new york city and the film s ultra low budget gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior the naked city a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled and some of the investigating procedures are clever otherwise it s not much to write home about it is worth a look however for a glimpse at the seamier sections of new york city in the early s and old car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of s and s cars in the streets 
 aka demons iii made for italian tv although shot in english and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier demons films it was supposed to be simply titled the ogre which is how director lamberto bava had released it an american family rents an italian villa for the summer the woman virginia bryant has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon like structure hanging down from the ceiling it glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it it drips what looks like green paint of course the husband doesn t believe any of this the villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it but then the ogre itself appears in what looks like some kind of th centaury costume with what looks like a wolf s head attached to it and it s attracted to the scent of orchids the films isn t really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring there s no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool the ogre itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family s jeep cherokee the copy of the shriek dvd i watched was defective with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film a flaw i hope shriek has since corrected extras include a short interview with lamberto bava where he explains how this wasn t a sequel etc etc along with some trailers to other shriek dvd releases this is pretty standard stuff out of 
jerry spies tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis i didn t find this particular episode that funny the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame jerry is essentially the bad guy in this one tormenting poor tom for no particular reason there is the occasional flash of inspiration such as tom s literal heart in mouth experience and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body but on the whole this effort lacks the frenetic pacing excellent animation and sheer wit of most of t j s other cartoons 
tom is listening to one of those old time radio broadcasts something kids from the s to today would watch on tv however they didn t television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment from comedies to music to scary stories from the radio tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the phantom he s actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying such as hair standing on end icy chills race down her spine her heart beats in her throat etc jerry meanwhile is watching tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy cat antics we then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this cartoon in which jerry tortures tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure if the cat asks for trouble that s one thing but when he s minding own business and jerry is physically and in this case mentally abusing him i have a hard time rooting for the little guy these early t m efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed sometimes that one minute makes a difference it did here as this actually dragged for awhile it could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long that s usual for tom and jerry s usually they are much faster paced 
don t bother trying to watch this terrible mini series it is a six hour bore an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other there is no heat in this story no real passion no real romance it is a dry boring drawn out and uninspired as they come and it doesn t even meet the expected level of technical proficiency take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile 
this is the worst piece of crap i have seen recently there is nothing good about this movie the plot is plain stupid dialogs don t make any sense humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor actors just don t play the worse they don t even try the script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with ed wood and uwe boll there is only one good thing in this flick the fights they are well choreographed as one would expect of the hong kong guys and are the only reason to watch prince of the sun although i believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter didn t have to bother thinking about the storyline however this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end avoid it unless you are fan of the dragon lady cynthia rothrock 
stan laurel and oliver hardy had extensive separate film careers before they were eventually teamed for many of ollie s pre stan films he was billed on screen as babe hardy and throughout his adult life hardy was known to his friends as babe while touring postwar britain with laurel in a music hall act for bernard delfont hardy gave an interview to journalist john mccabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname early in his acting career hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed hardy s plump cheeks the ones on his face and said nice baby hardy s workmates started crying him babe and the nickname stuck although much of hardy s pre laurel work is very interesting notably his comedy roles in support of larry semon and the chaplin imitator billy west his teamwork with billy ruge who in a series of low budget shorts for the vim comedy film company is very dire indeed hardy and ruge were given the screen names plump and runt names which are unpleasant in their own right but made worse because ruge although shorter than hardy isn t especially a runt seen here hardy looks much as he does in his early hal roach films with laurel but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache one too many an absolutely typical plunt and runt epic is direly unfunny and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as that s my wife one of laurel and hardy s most hilarious films plump hardy is the star boarder in a rooming house run by a tall gawky landlady runt ruge is the porter plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle john whose dosh he expects to inherit his uncle is coming to see him and to meet plump s wife and baby there s only one problem plump hasn t got a wife and baby he s been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man now of course plump expects runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice of course the results are disastrous it would be nice if those disastrous results were funny but they aren t most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs spoilers coming vim director will louis who shows no instinct for camera framing the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than hardy and louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame this could be funny if done on purpose but it s merely inept at one point in this bad comedy an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as runt approaches a black laundress surely they wouldn t stoop that low for a laugh i thought but they do runt steals the woman s black infant and tries to fob this off as plump s progeny somehow plump acquires an infant s cot but he still hasn t got a baby with uncle john coming up the stairs plump conscripts runt for babyhood this gag might just possibly have worked with a midget or even with a truly runt sized actor such as chester conklin but billy ruge is only slightly below average height ruge s impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny and uncle john would have to be a complete moron to fall for it amazingly he does the most notable aspect of one too many is a brief appearance apparently her only ever film appearance by madelyn saloshin oliver hardy s first wife the marriage was not a happy one although hardy s marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of stan laurel s only one thing in this movie impressed me there is a very brief flashback sequence with hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty in there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks the one shown here is done gracefully and simply too bad this movie has no other merits one too many is definitely one film too many on oliver hardy s cv and i ll rate this movie just one point out of laurel and hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately 
a sentimental school drama set in denmark we shall overcome offers a pathetic danish take on us culture frits janus dissing rathke a flower power obsessed naive year old exits with half his ear hanging off from brutal master lindum svendsen s bent mejding office lindum svendsen a school director portrayed as a fascistoid tyrant has the local community in control lindum svendsen s gone too far this time and with his father recovering from a mental breakdown sure there wasn t enough drama already and overly stereotyped hippie music teacher mr svale hi call me freddie frits stands up for justice tell you what it s so unconvincing over method acted and so full of misery that as a family picture this grotesque filled with clich s excuse for a movie fails miserably to convince non scandinavian audiences sorry kind danish readers to crash like this into your sentimental journeys but it s definitely not a tale about a boy becoming a man by fighting the system the boy never becomes a man but rather remains a naive big eyed cry face if you call a church of small minded small town folk led by a dictator like cartoonish character the system i m sorry if i m missing something if you re into family pictures go see happy feet instead 
so where are the cannibals those intrigued by the title and the real cannibal appeal of this film will be let down instead we are shown a strange man and his re visiting of a papua new guinea village full of natives one of whom was his lover several decades prior the man tobias schneebaum is new york jewish as they come and somehow this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes there are no real cannibals here only stories relayed by some of the natives and by tobias himself not all together a bad film very interesting and great cinematography schneebaum remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from western civilization as one can get it s just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary out of kids 
 because if i was i may have wished it was me being crucified on a wooden cross i m still trying to determine the plot of this movie and i m being generous that there was even a plot to begin with as previously mentioned it s a misnomer on the cover of the dvd that richard dreyfuss is actually the star he was barely in the movie and if he was indeed frustrated as the back cover indicated he was well that s probably because he said yes to be in this disaster of a movie and couldn t get out of it the movie really seemed to focus on jared martin and what his role in the movie was supposed to be other than the extreme close ups was not as big of a mystery as to what gene barry s role actually was or wasn t and speaking of big whomever had the bright idea to fit gene barry in the humpty dumpty attire which showcased his trousers literally pulled up to his chin should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober i could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was from the dialogue not matching the actors mouths think clutch cargo to the erratic jumping from scene to scene again being generous even calling the frames of pictures scenes to the lack of a plot however if you re into bad early s genre and if you re in a cottage in michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid cat pictures i recommend having a good bottle of wine before you embark on this weird ride of a movie because you ll be thankful that you may not remember it the next day 
it was and a simpler time the seventies a simpler place san francisco where a man could make a simple movie about a drug crazed psychotic re crucifixion of christ as a woman on acid with never ending dream sequences and inter cut flashbacks while having a multi racial inter gender orgies regardless of financial responsibilities or moral repercussion this movie tedious slow boring is the worst example of the kind of pretentious heavy handed art school dreck that passed as art in the midst of the s and i love it once this train wreck of endless slow motion zoom ins and heavy reverbed echo chamber acid guitar licks starts you can t take your eyes off of it until the ridiculous and absurd end its kind of a cross between jesus christ superstar beyond the valley of the dolls and a really crappy acid trip with your parents on a water bed its simultaneously a train wreck completely fascinating and also a great snapshot of the worst or best elements of b grade seventies phychadelic film genre the plot i ll just tell you the plot because you will hardly be able to tell whats happening due to the constant cross edited flashbacks to events that may or may not have happened to characters that may or may not be themselves and the face painted hippy freak nicks endlessly cavorting about in banal sequences of performance art level mime like street theater logan is a really annoying iconoclast film maker who yells at people allot and is surrounded by a mostly silent film crew who are always dropping acid and having what seem like really bad orgies richard dreyfus has an ancillary role as what seems like the accountant the film crew seems to hate him for some reason and break out into maniacal laughter perhaps to torment him suzanne the titular character is a willowy blond who stairs vacuously into space and comforts the totally insane artist character the artist is going completely mad by the way either from his hamfisted overacting or the incredible awfulness of his paintings all of course terrible nudes of susanne there are some other characters that randomly show up a cigar chomping the man character who also is all hot for suzanne i guess he has a monologue i couldn t really ever figure out what he had to do with the story except everyone had to hate the man back then and you couldn t make a movie without one there is also a mute girl the mute girl pays off in the end trust me its incredibly stupid 
 the second coming of suzanne is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep like other movies of this type there is limited dialogue everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot however the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your attention the video box states that this film is one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film yeah sure it s right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile 
richard dreyfuss is indeed in this flick but in a rather small part he is not the obsessed filmmaker he s the group s business manager accountant even the box describes the film inaccurately there are no erotic scenes with sondra locke as advertised unless one uses the term erotic quite loosely i would not have considered viewing the film without richard dreyfuss being in it as a major character i might have however had i realized that the famous s anthem leonard cohen s suzanne was an artistic influence other than the brief recitation of lines from the end of james joyce s ulysses and an interesting visual reference to the end of ingmar bergman s the seventh seal i found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic elements and moods immortalized in films like last year at marianbad and un chien andalou if you like the idea of the eccentric artistic troupe there are many superior films ranging from bye bye brasil to cecil b demented 
this is a really stupid movie in that typical s genre action comedy conceptwise it resembles rush hour but completely lacks the action the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a stand up and as a talk show host but he just cannot act he is awful when he tries to act tough he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one liners which by the way aren t very funny and seeing him run even back then is not a pleasant sight in addition i have a feeling that pat morita at least by today s standards doesn t give a very politically correct impression of the japanese don t even get me started about the story i give it a out of 
collusion course is even worse than the typical evil white male corporate capitalist movie of the week this movie is less pleasant than a toothache jay leno can act he s good in his underrated debut movie the silverbears in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character this movie is so bad leno s character a sanctimonious buffoon is less annoying than morita s character a sanctimonious fool 
the novelty of hearing clean cut jay leno spout four letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched police partners caper in collision course the pelican faced comedian teams up with the late pat morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger think car lover leno played a hand in the plot the two leads try hard they really do but leno is no actor and morita s fish out of water routine gets old in a hurry the film carries a bit of cheesy s appeal but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong minute running time fans of leno s considerable comedic talents will feel let down everyone else will just be bored 
this movie was awesome not quite as good as the leif garrett masterpiece longshot but still awesome i thought ashley looked freakin huge compared to mary kate in this film i wonder why who woulda thought they could swith places like that and almost get away with it dad was kinda a jerk though and mom was a little too chummy with helmit head i give it any one who likes this movie shoudl check out longshot 
yes you guessed it another movie where identical twins switch places i think now that the olsen twins are getting older they should try and make the plot less predictable and less like re runs of full house if you plan on seeing this film don t watch the parent trap instead it s more entertaining 
any film with a title as ridiculous as the bagman should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover but the plot is far different than what one may expect after viewing the dvd cover the bagman is by no means a good movie it falls into the category of films that seem to have been and probably were filmed on a home video camera the acting is awful i haven t heard and seen such wooden acting since troll there are plenty of scenes with nudity and sex but they are clearly jumped into too fast the characters are morons and entirely forgettable the ending which i will not spoil can be easily anticipated after watching the very first scene due to the cheesy nature of the film nothing aside from the awful production values is truly scary awful attempts at realistic gore a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary etc recommended for bad movie aficionados only 
dear friends and family i guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen then that s their eternal damnation just remember kids birth control doesn t mean oral sex i don t care what the honor student says on the other hand even if the senator s aid quotes himself as a bit of a romantic guy he s still only hitting on a high school girl if she was my sister i d eat this guys kneecaps other than that i found out that mongolians don t kiss the same way the french do and that baseball players named zoo like delicate undergarments i think i d almost rather watch richie rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip slap slop thank you and good night 
i got this dvd well over years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday i don t know why it took me so long as i do like the inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and the gadgetinis while it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie there are some old things missing that bog this gadget right down the toilet first of all the classic inspector gadget theme song and music is completely absent the composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it s still just no good enough the gadget mobile is now a talking car not a car that can turn into a van plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool penny no longer has her computer book and she and brain hardly make an appearance at all the plot is non existent there s something about a transformation formula and doctor claw using for some never revealed evil but that s all i got what the deal was with the short giant italian guy i will never know it had nothing to do with anything and if the title is anything to go by his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever and he stays on the force so why it s called last case is a mystery also i wasn t impressed at all this is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on dvd but don t let that prompt you into buying whatever inspector gadget dvds you can i sold this mere seconds after finally watching it no kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it 
what is it is a mish mash of bizarre recurring motifs snails shirley temple swastikas and overtly racist music among others unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development the whole thing struck me as self consciously freak show and i don t mean only the unusual casting decisions it has the feel of a bad acid trip far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to hunter s thompson or william s burroughs the only movie to which i can compare it is eraserhead my second least favorite film of all time which was by intent much more depressing but i still found what is it a total waste of my time it s one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone else s mind even someone else s chemically altered consciousness but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness 
the words swedish and action movie do not mix that becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre this is yet another failed attempt lasse brunell shanti roney works at a military air base with top secret computer systems one day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he doesn t do what they tell him they want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it this movie has it s ups and downs and usually in swedish action movies there are no ups just downs so i guess something in this movie showed some quality to begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made the footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice the acting is of very varying quality shanti roney makes a decent performance while maria bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual i wonder how long swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank stefan sauk is laughable as the cool special forces man who comes to the base to investigate and what about the action scenes well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice but aside from that there is not much action to talk about and that is a common problem with swedish action films there is just not enough action going on maybe it s a budget problem maybe it s film making culture i don t know but it negatively affects the experience because quite frankly the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on that i rate this for effort 
here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film a sub genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so i ve heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie and as much as i hate to be redundant the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything the punch bowl over poor jeremy s head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie `hey everyone this is the director and the following is my carrie rip off scene enjoy but that s just a suggestion spoilers the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning she gets killed people wonder in the old oh but that stuff only happens to other people tone and then they start to get killed the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful but they have no idea how to do it take jason for example here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated he is assumed to carry some significance besides that and more importantly he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentine s day cards it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects and jason is a perfect example of the effort but not such a good example of a successful effort sure i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer but that s not the point we know from early on that he is terrible with women which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film but then in the middle of the film he appears at a party smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls and then gives them a hateful look and walks away disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation we already know he is a cardboard character but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him on the positive side the killer s true identity was in fact made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also unfortunately yet another rip off early in the film when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel he makes no sound suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female rather than a male as everyone suspects but then for the rest of the film we just have this stolid relentless unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife director jamie blanks who with all due respect looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade mentions being influenced by halloween this is of course completely unnecessary because it s so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyer s is that michael s mask was so much more effective and he didn t have a problem with nosebleeds this stuff is shameless at the end there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is complete with slow and drawn out `and the killer is mask removal but then we see adam s nose start to bleed as he holds kate his often reluctant girlfriend and we know that he s been the killer all along nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film valentine is not scary i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember and even i wasn t scared and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren t so obvious that they were just going to die i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews although the film was in and out of the theater s faster than battlefield earth but the end result is the same old thing 
maggie smith and peter ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all the film shows promise for ustinov is released from prison for embezzling he convinces robert morley to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin hacking away at computers at a very fancy firm run by karl malden and bob newhart another unusual duo for films morley sounds just as he did in s marie antoinette perhaps he needed to return to that genre this film is ridiculous at best hard to believe that the following year maggie smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering oscar performance in the prime of miss jean brodie ms smith is made out here to be an apparent dumb red head but by film s end she is the brains of the outfit too bad the writing didn t go the way with her 
the more i think about it there was nothing redeeming about this movie i saw it months ago so my memory might have made it worse than it was but i do know it was at least as bad as a out of after seeing the movie i met the director he seemed so clueless as to what he was doing or what he had done and as far as i could tell he didn t care for the film either even he agreed that he didn t really know what he was doing and he was forced to do certain things because it was filmed digitally i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that it built for itself people all have to be connected in some way how can we get from point a to point b so in order get from the prostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they minutes on each character s relationship to another person it makes one feel choked by the demensional badly drawn characters i just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie steve bouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing that s it as i say out of 
the concept of the legal gray area in love crimes contributes to about of the movie s appeal the other can be attributed to it s flagrant bad ness to say that sean young s performance as a so called district attorney is wooden is a gross understatement with her bland suits and superfluous hair gel young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them this hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie watching young go from frigid to full frontal nudity does little to raise interest but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does watching her rant and rave about her self loathing and sexual frustration makes love crimes worth the rental fee but it s all downhill to and from there despite her urge to bring patrick bergin s character to justice her policing skills completely escape her in the throes of her own tired lust and passion patrick bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath if it worked in sleeping with the enemy it sure as hell can work in this but i can t help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy young brings to the film conflicts with his sliminess i m guessing it does and the result is a thriller with thrills that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic 
 contains spoilers the truly exquisite sean young who in some scenes with her hair poofed up looks something like elizabeth taylor is striking in her opening moments in this film sitting in the back of a police car waiting to signal a bust her face and body are tense and distracted unfortunately once the bust is over young s strained demeanor never changes this is one fatally inhibited actress one has only to compare young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend arnetia walker to grasp what is missing in young walker is open emotional and at ease at all times in that there s no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it she is an open book young on the other hand acts in the skittish self conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film basically she doesn t have a clue with this major void looming at the center of the movie we re left to ponder the implausiblities of the story for instance after miss young is kidnapped by the criminal she s trailing and locked in a closet she breaks the door down when left alone granted she s dressed only in a bra and panties but in a similar situation with a psycho captor due to return any moment would you head for the door or take the time to go through his dresser take out some clothes and get dressed i would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions miss young s character is experiencing but young can not convey this type of complexity there are a few affecting moments in the film such as the short police interviews with the criminal s past victims but overall this is an aimless endeavor it s too bad miss young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor batman and dick tracy because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching watching miss young try to act at least in this thriller is a sad spectacle 
 spoilers spoilers are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality it awfully seems so first of all this is a noble premise that could ve been utilized well a rejected young nerd who grows up stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high can t say you had nothing to work with but this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike we know the pattern by now these stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute let me ask you something who in their right mind is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she s all alone and surrounded by corpses does that make any damn sense at all valentine is only occasionally innovative one good shot involves the butchering of denise richards character she gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw there s some good songs in the soundtrack including one cool track by orgy the music video is contained in the special features section on the dvd even the acting is mediocre at best the actors all sleep through their roles of course david boreanaz is often stoic even in his portrayal as the title character on angel denise richards is a fine actress though and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie valentine is just like you d expect pretentious implausible forgettable cheesy and without a good scare in sight don t even bother my score out of 
man this was hilarious it should be under comedy or stupid it would have made realizing what a pile of stank this was much easier seriously i want anyone associated with this movie tased effective immediately for everyone who is thinking of watching this movie let s go over a few plot points oh wait there aren t any there is literally no plot i think casper van dien was bored and he decided to film something with some random someones and miraculously it somehow got on videotape this movie is literally the worst movie of all time don t believe me go watch it do it man i dare you but be prepared to gouge your eyes out if you can sit through this without blowing a cow you are very strong and courageous 
mild spoilers contained herein i m spoiling this film to save you the trouble of having to watch it jet li s movies fall into one of two categories shaolin period movies and movies set in modern day hong kong revolving around triads or triad like organizations each genre has its best and worst films `twin warriors is jet li s best shaolin era flick while `the evil cult is his worst `fist of legend while in the recent past is the best `modern era jet li movie `black mask without a doubt is the worst jet li plays a self exiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability but shortens his life span in his `new life in exile he plays a pacifist librarian when his old mercenary squad goes on a rampage jet li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them he dons a very silly corrugated cardboard mask so as to conceal his identity from the police and public as a librarian as well as to conceal his true identity to his ex comrades in arms the version i saw was dubbed and horribly at that why does jet li capture and hold hostage his library co worker if he s a pacifist is there a love story between them why does the police chief not care when he learns of the black mask s true identity the plot is just plain bad bad by way of the superhero cheesiness bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed bad in its character interactions all topped off by a half explained story i quickly lost interest in the action and martial arts sequences are way over the top lots of blood gore severed body parts aplenty explosions and matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point if you want to see jet li playing a vigilante superhero in a mission impossible style movie `black mask delivers for the rest of us jet li fans it is a true disappointment this is one of those movies where jet li never gets to be jet li he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability normally a chinese knockoff of ozzy osbourne would be enough to engross me in a film sadly `black mask proved to be an exception to that rule indeed the antagonist of this movie by the way he dresses his long straight hair and trademark round sunglasses looks like the modern and aged ozzy osbourne however the villain isn t on screen long enough to make the gimmick worthwhile i am assuming the likeness to ozzy was intentional in addition to the villain s look he also ran a satanic looking hideout so much more could have been made from the ozzy osbourne villain gimmick if only the writer director or anyone had bothered to give a background to and develop the character of the film s arch villain `black mask was the first jet li film released on video in the usa after lethal weapon and i m glad i stayed away from it until now it may well have ruined my whole perception of jet li as a martial artist and actor if you want to see jet li at his worst rent `black mask and `the evil cult and make it a double feature or horror both intentional and unintentional otherwise stick to moves that utilize the talents of jet li and have plots that are semi well thought out and plausible stars 
the movie was awful the theater was dead with silence cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash i think someone gave jet li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old the martial arts are ok but when put next to the jackie chan movies and the matrix you re better off seeing one of those 
lame cliched superhero action movie drivel i had high hopes for this movie and the genre of hk buddy cop actioneers is one that i don t despise but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was this would have been forgivable as it always is in these kinds of movies when the action compensates unfortunately it did not the action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of hk action but it s not very involving obscenely gory and in fact often completely incoherent perhaps this is due to re editing for american release it does show signs in many places of patchwork i was very disappointed 
it s hard to believe an action packed jet li movie could be so boring but this was transcendant trash the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocky flicks the martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent it s a comic book story about a group of super human soldiers who are to be killed because they re mentally unstable one of their number li who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian the saved killers resurface with an austin powers quality plot to take over the world and li sheds his new life to save the world the version i saw was dubbed and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer thin plot and comic book cent special effects but i suspect even ninja turtle watching year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow 
i was very disappointed in this movie plotwise it was weak bordering on silly souls who can affect reality in the way they do a mission apparently critical to the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members and the whole b story with the holobrothel and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point i blurted out to the television why are you wasting my time with this thematically river of souls didn t really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode soul hunter did we see that soul hunters can make mistakes but we still don t get a feeling for their culture are there any female soul hunters the acting was okay given the material they had to work with and the special effects especially the planetscapes in the first act were very impressive but overall i d say give this one a miss 
ouch what a painfully boring sci fi movie and that s especially saddening because the opening minutes were so action packed and full of potential during the intro we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top secret files as he s about to reveal the supposedly horrible inhuman events that take place in the lab he s executed figures from then on the action swifts back and forth between two locations the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator or something and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing more like dull pointless and vague scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it s really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds anyway they all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed yet i fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity threatening device perhaps i missed something but i doubt it the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow as really none of them have personalities so basically the brain machine just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren t for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings the relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every single time by a five second shot of the places either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all sci fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying i assure you james best s performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent but one man definitely can t save this thing from being an absolute waste of time avoid 
this movie was rented by a friend her choice is normally good i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie although it was a horror movie which i don t prefer but no horror came to mind while watching the movie it was a dull not very entertaining movie the appearance of denise richards was again a pleasure for the eye but that s it we the four of us we re a little bit disappointed but feel free to see this movie and judge it yourself 
an absolutely wretched waste of film nothing ever happens no ghosts hardly any train no mystery no interest the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful everything else is pathetic the premise is idiotic a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no place because their train was held up for less than minutes what and the railroad leaves them no place to stay in a heavy storm i think not oh they can walk miles across the dead black fields umm yeah sure or they can force themselves on the railroad s hospitality and stay at the haunted train station a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring utterly without ghosts interest or plot so very terribly dull that this seems impossible this ought to be added to the lost films list aargh 
arthur askey s great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public his juvenile jokes silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world a lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him and he was never completely comfortable in films he has his moments in the ghost train and his character tommy gander has been tailored to make the most of his talents but askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated askey s support in the film is not strong it includes regular co star richard murdoch betty jardine and stuart latham as a dopey honeymoon couple linden travers going over the top as a mad woman also on board are peter murray hill who off screen married phyllis calvert as the nominal leading man giving a totally bland reading of the part and leading lady carol lynne who turns in an equally insipid performance it is left to character actress kathleen harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on dr morland graham s brandy 
this movie is more like a music video kusturica said in an interview from that when he is making movies he feels like making music and when he is making music he feels like making movies the best thing in promise me this is the music written by stribor kusturica kusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise promise me this has very little noise i liked life is a miracle it was also like music video for the first minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful plot promise me this has no plot i was awaiting this movie with big expectations because i ve read that the script has been written by ranko bozic one of my favourite scriptwriters who participated also in life is a miracle ranko bozic writes great dialogues but for kusturica they are noise and much to my regret i saw only two dialogues which i could identify as written by ranko bozic the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son stribor gordan mihic the man who wrote the scripts for time of the gypsies and black cat white cat said in an interview that kusturica never follows the script black cat white cat was the only script for which kusturica said that he will not touch it according to gordan mihic after all kusturica comes back to the script and if he doesn t he doesn t make a good movie and i think this is the case with promise me this he should have followed the script of ranko bozic promise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few moments which made me laugh the comedic moments are in the same style as black cat white cat but are not that funny at all i think the difference comes from the fact that black cat white cat was written by gordan mihic however i know some people who liked promise me this they find it very positive movie 
i did not expect a lot from this movie after the terrible life is a miracle it turns out that this movie is ten times worse than life i have impression that director writer is just joking with the audience let me see how much emptiness can you audience sustain dialogues are empty scenario is minimalistic in few moments photography is really nice few sarcastic lines are semi funny but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this comedy i ve laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end if you can lift yourself above this director s fiasco you will find good acting of few legends miki manojlovic aleksandar bercek and very good performance of emir s son stribor kusturica in short too bad for such a great director emir kusturica is still young and should be making top rated movies instead he chooses to do this low budget just for my private theater movie with arrogant attitude toward the world trends and negligence toward his old fans 
not really spoilers in my opinion but i wanted to cover myself nevertheless as the executive producer morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in items or less a movie with an intentional indie feel and just be absorbed in the mentor be all that you can be theme he plays a alternate universe semi washed up version of the real morgan freeman who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson ca from brentwood to research his next movie role why carson is a mystery to so cal residents he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements paz vega is pretty to watch a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman s research his character is only known as him to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people psst that s him etc unfortunately i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood carried no cash or debit card or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has nothing really happens in this movie i don t believe that either of the main character s were substantially changed by their encounter with each other it flirts with the idea of adultery but then that thought fizzles this to me was similar to steve martin s shopgirl without the sexual affair it was self indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience 
a still famous but decadent actor morgan freeman has not filmed for four years when he is invited to participate in a new project he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor latin neighborhood in carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket he sees the gorgeous spanish cashier scarlet paz vega and he becomes attracted with her ability his driver never returns to catch him and scarlet gives a ride to the actor but first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time i am a big fan of morgan freeman and paz vega however the pointless items or less is absolutely disappointing this low budget movie does not seem to have a storyline and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of morgan freeman and paz vega and actually nothing happens along minutes the ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous with the character of morgan freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family or was a clash of classes and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes my vote is four title brazil um astro em minha vida a star in my life 
this movie was great the first time i saw it when it was called lost in translation but somehow bill murray turned into an eccentric black man played by morgan freeman scarlett johansson turned into a cranky latino woman played by paz vega and tokyo japan turned into carson california instead of meaningful conversations and silence we enjoyed in translation we get meaningless blabbering in items that verges on annoying instead of characters that were pensive and introspective as in translation we get characters that spew pointless advice on topics they have no clue about how can a character that wears hundred dollar t shirts and has never been inside a target department store expect to give advice to a working class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant don t think that stops him if he isn t giving her clothing advice he s telling her what she should eat the most annoying part of the movie for me was how supposedly they were in a hurry to make an appointment and yet the characters keep finding time to run another errand be it washing the car stopping at arby s or just laying around to list off their items or less lists of things they love and hate i kept wanting to yell at them saying didn t you say you had somewhere to be what the heck are doing a minute ago you were practically late now you re eating roast beef and pondering your lives until i saw this movie i never truly understood how something could insist upon itself but i think this movie does exactly that and undeservedly so the dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unsympathetic with the exception that i felt sorry for both of the actors for having signed onto this project 
after i watched this movie i came to imdb and read some of the reviews which compared it to lost in translation lite when i read that i immediately could see the reviewers point this movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme interestingly the format of the movie is nearly identical but the pacing is incredibly different items rushes the viewer through the day time line of the movie whereas the better planned lost in seems to stretch out over a few long days i m sure some people will see this because it has morgan freeman and will be disappointed it seems his better roles now a days are supporting roles in big blockbusters rather than leading roles in sub mil limited release movies and indie films 
strange i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies but didn t like this one at all it s awful horrible and surely not funny at all pity cannot do a whole movie plot disgust either and it was really boring long empty moments fills the movie it could have been removed it should have been in another shorter format surely maybe i expected too much from the crew like saving the movie lol it s also filled with overused clich s of characters and situations i don t get it why people liked it poetry hope nope mam didn t see anything like that ^^ all in all it s empty and crude pitiful and hopeless oh darn this one

i don t know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business this movie short is gross to say the least it is a bunch of year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins acting like adults and too much so however it is interesting because it is a good example of how the good old days may not have been so good after all thank god we have laws against this kind of material now this is one short from the shirley temple festival 
this is a horrible little film and unfortunately the company that made this short made several others the short is essentially a one joke idea that wasn t funny to begin with and may also offend you it certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children most appeared about years old cavorting about and pretending to be adults in this case a dancehall girl and bar room patrons it s the sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own kids if they pretended to be adults but i can t see anyone wanting to see this especially when a very young shirley temple is dressed in a rather slinky outfit and acts like a vamp and then other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations at the time i am sure they were not trying to appeal to pedophiles but when looking at it today that is what immediately comes to mind because of this this boring film also creeped me out and i hope to never see it again pretty strange and pretty awful 
i rented the dubbed english version of lensman hoping that since it came from well known novels it would have some substance while there were hints of substance in the movie it mostly didn t rise above the level of kiddie cartoon maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book or it lost a lot in the dubbed version or maybe even the source novels were lightweight but for whatever reason there wasn t much there i noticed lots of details that were derivative sloppy poorly dramatized or otherwise deficient some examples the opening scenes looked borrowed from the star gate scene and the star wars image of hyperspace the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized r d it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars but mercifully since the humor doesn t work gives up on comedy and plays it serious in that sense it s superior to the star wars franchise which started with a clever sense of humor and eventually deteriorated to jar jar s annoying silliness the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field dumping silage onto unharvested crops rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already harvested rows or into a truck corn maize was pouring out the grain chute but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field when it was time for kim s father had to face his fate there wasn t any dramatic weight to the scene that could have been partly the fault of the english language voice actor but the drawings didn t show much weight either kim s reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing similarly when a character named henderson was killed chris showed very little reaction even though they were apparently supposed to have been close henderson s death is no spoiler his name isn t revealed until his death scene she seems to promptly forget him someone s expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case there s at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chris on several occasions villains fail to accomplish their orders a villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths i can t say whether that s lifted from star wars or if that comes from an earlier source possibly the lensman books there s a scene where a space ship crash lands as it plunges toward the ground parts are break off the ship but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands while in most cases chris seems like a competent tough space hero there s a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress someone tough enough to get over henderson s death so quickly should at least be able to shout help it s got me and i can t reach my gun instead of just shrieking the character with the most personality almost too much at times is d j bill he sounded like wolfman jack the d j in american graffiti i wonder if he s as well voiced in the original language two planets in the movie exploded the explosions were unimpressive and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars to its credit however the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death star s primary weapon the dialog had a good interesting explanation for the cause many other explosions in the movie did look good just not the planetary explosions some of the sound effects are very cheesy as if borrowed from a late s video game some of the images look like primitive video games and some influence from tron is visible too on the other hand the sound effects are often pretty decent although that emphasizes the cheesy sounding parts the art is good too particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy looking computer graphics finally there s the story if a movie tells a good story it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings but the plot here was pretty lightweight a na ve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship and acquires a great power he doesn t understand he and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful unredeemably evil enemy he makes friends learns about his special power and grows into a young man if he is persistent and virtuous enough he might even defeat the evil enemy details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline but there s very little more than that in this movie in the end it s just a kiddie cartoon but then since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children maybe it doesn t need to be anything more than that 
wow watching this film today you can t help but be appalled by the writing of this film spencer tracy and loretta young play a couple who in modern times might be featured on the jerry springer show as they have a sick and abusive relationship and inexplicably the writers appear to be endorsing it the film begins with a hungry and homeless loretta being shown the ropes by the poor but very resourceful spencer tracy he shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay it s never clear whether or not they marry and considering it s a pre code film you can assume they aren t even though they are cohabiting their relationship is very strange and rather sick while you can see that tracy cares about her by his actions he is verbally abusive and a total jerk and young comes running back for more like some sort of dog he calls her skinny or ugly and these are in a sick way his way of using endearments later when he starts fooling around with another woman glenda farrell she tells her friend that if that s what he wants it s okay with her it sure smacks of a sado masochistic relationship and you can t help but feel a bit horrified sure he doesn t hit her but the relationship is very abusive to show how sick it is when young gets pregnant she tells him it s your baby and it s mine but you don t need to worry i ll take all the blame for it yikes doesn t this all seem a bit like looking through a peephole into a sick and dysfunctional home later in a case of art imitating life tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears after all he can t be burdened with a baby even if it s his but he changes his mind and decides to return home wow that s bit of him and when he returns he s nasty and acts like if he stays he isn t obligated to care for the kid and she tells him he s a free man free as a bird wow i was almost in tears at this tender moment not soon this crazy pair are married and naturally young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits him not because of any love or sense of responsibility so how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters what would you do well as for the writers they have tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat the romantic aspects of the film are underwhelming to say the least during the robbery tracy behaves like a chump doing almost nothing to take precautions not to get caught like he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison and to show what sort of nice guy he is the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friends while there s more to the film the bottom line is that tracy is a jerk and young is an idiot in the film despite both being very good actors there s absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced nice music nice sets good acting and a script that is poo how the film is currently rated is beyond me and i wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters a horrible misfire that somehow didn t destroy the careers of those involved oh and if you wonder if loretta ever gets a backbone in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong the answer is no by the end she s learned nothing and hasn t changed one whit for the better they sure don t make films like they used to and in this case thank god 
i m not sure what hk movies the other reviewers have been watching but enter the eagles is nowhere near the top of the heap in hk action michael fitz wong should be glad he can get acting jobs in hk because he couldn t act his way out of a wet paper bag in english shannon lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter even better with the leg fighting than her dad but her acting skills are also sub par in fact all the english dialog of the movie even more than in gen y cops is so bad that i switched to mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the redundancy of the english subs sure there are some decent gunfights but nothing we haven t already seen before and good cinematography but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action that said it s worth the price of admission to watch shannon and benny the jet urquidez go at it spectacular and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for finally you might notice some scenes that seem familiar to you notably a shootout at an outdoor market think matrix and fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues think mi guess someone thought at least a few things in this flick were worth ripping off 
may contain spoilers so i watched this movie last night on lmn lifetime movie network which is not known for showing quality movies this movie is awful i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing as it was terrible could this movie contain any more stereotypes harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor catholic family with priest sons big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family s house mexican whores bad guy who is really a softie at heart incredibly bad country accents gag i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it i decided to stay awake until am to watch it anyway the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick s beauty i suppose pollack s and nemec s acting is okay but they have a horrid script to work with unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang i think that the accents were there in supporting characters like mary margaret s date and john and were unnecessary they were also very very bad i am so very tired of hollywood southern accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in would not have been expensive i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town the beautiful capitol building the ut tower lit up for a winning football game etc none of these things were there also it takes about hours to drive to mexico from austin at one point in the movie michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark during the summer and early fall it doesn t get dark in austin until pm or so spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican is there any other kind whores and then return to austin by dawn while this is theoretically possible it is not very likely and if anyone has started school in the hill country usually the third week of august but may have been in september in they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they do not wear their letter jackets in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is degrees only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school all in all a very bad made for tv movie experience 
this film was made in saskatchewan and manitoba parks and returned the world eye again to what little of the wild western canada is left when archie began to write his stories for the papers the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convert absorb the first nation peoples the film puts forward and asks the question why would a well educated obviously talented englishman become an indian archie as an english boy dreams about becoming something but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless no mater what it is sounds like a famous puppet story doesn t it in my opinion i saw archie become my living image of the cigar store indian a very wooden character and not real at all very well done acting on the part of mr brosnan he also portrayed the wild indian in the dance scene for the tourist the fullness and or reality of it weren t realized till he met and married his wife annie annie pushed archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the englishman s world stage not as himself but grey owl an canadian native of the wilderness frontier this is the closest archie get to becoming the noble savage prototype mr brosnan s interpretation as well as the directors is both well done i have watched documentaries on grey owl and i think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection spoiler i thought the final scenes with archie going to meet the grand council of chiefs was a great a great moment in the film very beautiful canadian lake scenery and real grey owl locations 
oh dear some of the best talent in british tv made this serial and so i can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure and had to settle for first takes of many scenes there are some frightening scenes in this highland mystery mostly when the monster attacks and we see it from his point of view but i m afraid that i found most of the story unintentionally funny such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course oh look there s a hand oh and there s another hand over there hmm this is a bit puzzling for many years fans of british cult tv shows campaigned to have this serial released on vhs or dvd but the bbc always said no now i think i understand why 
i give stars only for the beautiful pictures of africa the rest was well pretty boring for about min we have the outline of the plot in war of the worlds the introductory part lasted oh about min then was real action this is something like let s take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets and maybe deliver a message like don t kill elephants very ecological i would have expected this out of a new steven segal movie not from this the leading actress makes me think about artificial sun tan dyed hair and too much foundation and i didn t see one scene where her hair is messed up or she sweats or her clothes are dusty she just doesn t look like a century woman and in the bar where they seek up our hero swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like dracula hmmm bram stoker wrote his book and published it in and it became famous in the next years livingstone and other explorers went to central africa from to so unless the action takes place between and houston we have a problem swayze makes a nice impression as a nutshell hard on the outside but soft and cuddly on the inside not that i would cuddle with a nut but you get the point he really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions the movie stank way too long and increasingly boring don t watch it don t buy it it s a waste of your money 
this is the worst imaginable crap the novel by h rider haggard is very entertaining and dramatic the makers of this worthless movie don t follow it closely well old novels aren t sacred and making free versions of them is fine with me if one has ideas of one s own if all one can do is changing things and replace them with uninteresting and watered down clich s one should stick to the original if they had done that this film would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed inside a studio with huts made of cardboard but there s no imagination at all only tiredness this should be bought or watched only by collectors of victorian novels made into movies just a hint and not a spoiler i think to make those of you who have read the novel understand what has taken place and what you may expect if you decide to watch this on tv or god forbid waste money on buying this gagool an old baddie witch in the book and some precursor to gollum has been turned into a nice gal 
start of with the good bit several times swayze talks zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes that s a great plus as normally usa uk movie audiences think all people on this planet speak english just in case you re one of them no they don t but the acting is tenenkrommend as we say in the netherlands it makes your toes curl and not in a good way i like swayze but in this he s awful the muscles in his jaws make overtime and he s frowning the whole movie some one must have told him it looks butch no patrick it looks silly and is compensation for lack of character alison doody elizabeth has opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her co workers her acting is s relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days and it s not your frock was a clue alison the best acting came from the people from the african continent and sided onyulo as umbopa i liked best clear warm and in character his performance is a joy to watch general it is mwah entertaining on a rainy day pity could have been better sack the director 
the movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the novel if you want to see the movie then don t read the novel first as it will shock you however cinematography was ok and if you are a person who loves adventure genres which explores africa then go for it acting performances are adequate however many important events that were present in the novel are omitted in the novel sir henry curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king 
ok not bad movie making if it were from an original script but it is not which part of in this story there are no women except for foulata and gagoola introduction by haggard did the producers directors and writers not understand i mean it is pretty plain english i understood it at age the beauty of ksm is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds the colonial africa the unforgiving desert and kukuanaland a hidden and isolated kingdom that should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with but nooo they have to throw romance into it pathetic suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book give it up until a peter jackson wannabe comes along and does it right you may as well keep re reading the tome btw there is a sequel book actually a pre quel called allan s wife it gives background to the story of quatermain it is a bit creepy but good 
the year was when shirley temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself unfortunately the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here two of those things were singing and dancing another was a short interesting film that kept people s attention and got their minds off the depression you know the other keys to shirley s successful films this film achieved none of the above despite the star presences of gary cooper and carole lombard and despite a very good director in henry hathaway in addition there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring and too many arguments between a sullen lombard and cooper to top it off you didn t get the normal feel good ending which is what the public wants i guess they learned after this movie 
having grown up in texas and less than miles from what used to be gilley s i can tell you that this movie is nauseating the majority of texans do not live like this movie indicates the plot is weak and the fake accents are amusing and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all texans are beer drinking honky tonkin rednecks the horribly fake texas accents is what kills it for me true there is a certain texas twang to most texans accents but these people overdo it you can t get someone from new jersey and ohio to do texas accents it just doesn t work john travolta should have stuck to disco dancing or the s debra winger was more convincing as wonder girl than she is as a texan 
first before reading further you must understand that i m not neo nazi i m just trying to understand correctly hitler to be sure nobody like him take power again i ve seen this series and found it awful i mean ok it s interesting to look but is it real i searched for answers and found one absolutely not first hitler wasn t angry all his life the series shows an angry hitler even when he is a child second hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter in fact it is highly probable that hitler in reality was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret third people will hate me but it s true hitler was charming how do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly because he was charming that s a common point i found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him of course not jews this series was awful because if you think that hitler was just an angry bastard ugly and of course not charming at all you re wrong if you think that you will let people like him take power in countries and you don t want that if you really understand how hitler managed to get into power and stop thinking he was just awful you ll be able to find dangerous politicians like him of course remember he was elected and stop theme before it s too late life is important to protect this series is just awful to show us the truth if we continue to see hitler like that another one will take place exactly as the first did 
if anybody really wants to understand hitler read wwi history not wwii history find out what happened during that war how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time how so many soldiers went insane from what they saw during wwi at the time they called it shellshocked now the call it post traumatic stress disorder if you learn the true horrors of wwi you will begin to understand hitler you will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them this movie unfortunately misses that as so many others do read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie paths of glory the only good wwi movie ever made you will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie the sense of helplessness and a utter devaluation of human life as nothing more than bullet catchers thats what this movie misses its really the key point to understanding germany a lost war where millions and millions of germans lost their lives for no real reason then comes an utter economic collapse following the war those are the factors that create extremism the loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism unfortunately this movie ignored these factors and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile with really no real value there are fictional movie s based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of hitler than this does they just threw hitlers name on this so it would sell more 
advertised by channel seven in australia as the untold story this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular character s childhood and adolescence in less time than a good director will use to set up a single event this cowardice and self censorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series and is ultimately responsible for its failure robert carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things the lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his northern uk heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal apparently acknowledging the fact that hitler was raised in a catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of vikings and their descendants by having carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about valhalla is quite okay well here s a clue for the writers any person familiar with viking mythology will tell you that valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle two things that the nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason hitler has never been excommunicated from the catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period of the world s history has to teach us so now that we ve managed to insult vikings and the citizens of scandinavian countries in this sham you d think the series would stop there but it doesn t stockard channing s listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrow raising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it patently transparent that more footage of hitler s early days were shot but not included because of a typical nanny state fear of offending someone it is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into hilter s character do not feature him at all until we learn to stop sugar coating the truth and realise that the citizenry of germany was mostly unopposed to hitler s views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy yes germany was a democracy pre hitler can occur anywhere we are doomed that s the one thing this mini series got right in portraying unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make hitler s religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter david letterman s show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series they really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star that s how badly it was written all in all this politically correct farce of a bio pic is worth no points but i gave it two because robert carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works 
i have recently watched this movie twice and i can t seem to understand why the h ll the makers made this pile of crap i mean yes it gives a great impression of hitler s environment and i mean the way they reproduced austria in the late s wwi and the inter war period what i can t understand is why they pictured hitler as a pure evil mad unreliable mentally unstable freak he was after all a very thoughtful loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides no doubt about that but why in heaven s name portray him in this way all of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario leaving nothing but a very propaganda like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever yes he threw germany into the devastating nd world war yes he was racist and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war all true but again why the hell did they plain lie to the public to warn us i absolutely don t think this movie was a warning the true danger of hitler and the nazi s was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness the fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every german alive not to mention austrians and a lot of other people makes it a warning to modern civilization not the fact hitler was such a weirdo if it would have been like the makers make us believe i would have been convinced that the german people were retarded a man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader not to mention reichskanzler 
simply put this is a simplistic and one dimensional film the title the rise to evil should tell you that this isn t going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with hitler s character rather from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background we are given a view of hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian seemingly ripped right out of a saturday morning tv show the film really wants to make its case that hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that hitler was evil ultimately making him such a one dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing one must ask how the inept phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named time s man of the year this film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the th century and try to delve into his mind instead it basically just says hey hitler was evil just thought you might like to know over and over again the great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character give me a break 
i watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities anyone who watched this film now probably think of hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some chicago gangster i can only to say that there is much better films about hitler and germany in those years and that rise of evil is very much under average i can recommend german film downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of switzerland actor bruno ganz in a roll of adolf hitler 
this is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of adolf hitler that i have ever watched robert carlyle is a wonderful actor but to cast him as hitler is just plain wrong to cast liev schrieber as hitler s longtime friend and aid haefengstal must have emitted cries of despair and anguish from the simon wiesenthal centre a j w playing a nazi supporter bad bad bad casting this was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background this was hollywood rubbish at its finest cashing in on the strength of a strong but sorely under utilized supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past years the fake german accents vee vill vin zis var is insulting to german people everywhere my mother is german and she sat fuming at the sound of the voices which kept switching from american english german all in the same sentence the supporting cast make better cardboard cutouts at the local video store than they do on screen jenna malone as the fated geli raubal was splendid though she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in hitler s shadow if you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of hitler s early years leading up to and including the war holocaust rent inside the third reich starring rutger hauer as albert speer and derek jacobi as hitler it was good and made more sense then this baloney as a historical researcher of the third reich i can honestly tell you this had me reaching for my books to confirm its myriad of inaccuracies 
 as usual i was really looking forward to a new tv film on a favourite subject of mine makes a nice change from a strangely familiar documentary about kursk or stalingrad on the history channel i avidly looked forward to pearl harbour and enemy at the gates but was rudely brought down to earth with the realisation of the malevolent stupid ifying power of hollywood and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe so yet again i got excited about the rise of evil especially as i heard that ian kershaw was involved as i ve enjoyed his books i can see why he quit to quote some guy responsible for this rubbish the kershaw book was an academic piece he said it was quite dry we needed more incidents incidents are they totally nuts hitler s life cannot be said to be without incident yes kershaw s two volume hitler biographies were long and detailed but they were supposed to be the thesis behind rise of evil seems to be hitler was a very bad man no he was a very bad man who hated jews and just in case you miss this we re going to emphasise the fact in every scene in the film there was no effort whatsoever to try and explain the mood of the time and why hitler may have adopted the views and strategy he did needless to say unlike the generally excellent nazis a warning from history this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the munich communist rising were jewish and that this may have coloured his views on the subject and his axiomatic linking of the jews with bolshevism an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the nazi era but there was not much understanding to be done the film makers weren t going to go there so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway we certainly don t get the fascinating fact that kershaw alludes to which has hitler briefly being a socialist communist immediately after ww that would of course be far too complex for the film to handle and might even detract from the relentless he was very bad mantra which bangs away incessantly we know he was a bad man however we also know that he was a mesmerising figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations he could be polite and even sympathetic and of course espoused some views like vegetarianism anti alcohol and anti smoking that many guardian readers could agree with he was also famously fond of animals hence why that wholly invented dog flogging scene was so absurd he was also from all the accounts i ve seen a brave soldier in ww whilst we saw him with his iron cross we never get to see how he won it acts of bravery were not in the script needless to say we also get no insight whatsoever into why he was so fired up by his war experiences whilst sassoon owen brook remarque and so many others found it so repellent an experience and again like the point above re the jewish bolshevik link this is vital to anyone s understanding about the subject why did he love war so much why did he think it was always a good idea despite massive evidence to the contrary why didn t he care about his colleagues who died or maybe he did but still drew the wrong conclusions this film certainly didn t have anything of any interest to say on this either as all too often these days the film is a classic example of making history relevant to the present and inventing stuff or leaving awkward facts out to fit in with the present which all too often is to cater to the lowest common denominator where you don t trust your audience an inch so you just ram stuff down their throats knowing sadly correctly that you ll always get away with it because there are so many dumb fools in the world history is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colours our present for better and for worse this rubbish was a great opportunity lost again they spent millions on it and the locations and large scenes were impressive but told us nothing at all we didn t know already and promoted no understanding of this dark period in human history wt
no wonder that the historian ian kershaw author of the groundbreaking hitler biography who originally was the scientific consultant for this tv film dissociated himself from it the film is historically just too incorrect the mistakes start right away when hitler`s father alois dies at home while in reality he died in a pub in the film hitler moves from vienna to munich in while in reality he actually moved to munich in i could go on endlessly hitler`s childhood and youth are portrayed way too short which makes it quite difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man important persons of the early time of the party like hitler`s fatherly friend dietrich eckart or the party philosopher alfred rosenberg are totally missing the characterization of ernst hanfstaengl is very problematic in the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises hitler the script obviously follows hanfstaengl`s own gloss over view of himself which he gave in his biography after the war in fact hanfstaengl was an anti semite and was crazy about his fuehrer but the biggest problem of the film is the portrayal of hitler himself he is characterized as someone who is constantly unfriendly has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everybody around after watching the film one wonders how such a disgusting person ever was able to get any followers since we all know what an evil criminal hitler was naturally every scriptwriter is tempted to portray hitler as totally disgusting and uncharismatic but facts is that in private he could be quite charming and entertaining his comrades didn`t follow him because he constantly yelled at them but because they liked this strange man beyond all those historical mistakes the film is well made the actors are first class the location shots and the production design give a believable impression of the era 
wonderful cast wasted on worthless script ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as juveniles could this ever happen in a million years it s simply a fantasy and a boring one at that do they become teenagers again do they reenact their pranks games good times they may try but ultimately the answer is no is there any intrigue any suspense horror comedy none of the above how anyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me i wanted to like this movie i tried to like this movie but my brain refused 
there s one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans everyone else this is just a very bad horror flick the female characters are typical horror movies females they are wooden annoying and dumb you are glad when they are killed off long live the strong female character in a horror movie 
i was looking over our dvd tower last night for something to watch we were between netflix mailings and it was a quiet saturday night i pulled one out that i never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend from the jacket it sounded like a rip off of the big chill but with the all star cast felt it might be worth watching boy was i wrong not only was it like the big chill it was a rip off almost character by character the bill paxton character was a copy of william hurt where have you been all this time role spoiler warning and lo and behold he remains behind to take care of the old place cabin camp kimberly williams meg tilly jerk womanizer matt craven jeff goldblum etc etc i found myself wondering why i m even watching these people there was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them how did unca lou even find these characters after years plus it wasn t even funny except when perkins fell err flopped out of bed the first morning it was a sign and i missed it after it was over i asked my wife were there any endearing characters in this film are you sleeping over there she replied no i m still thinking no none i can think of 
a thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine and here susan lucci performs as a siren although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one isabelle lucci inconstant wife of venture capitalist stewart collins john o hurley begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman richard davis philip casnoff simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for richard apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent when davis becomes convinced that guileful isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent stewart in the wake of the hit man s assault upon collins a pair of police detectives performed by joe grifasi and dean mcdermott become increasingly curious concerning isabelle s possible involvement in the crime while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata s maneuvering lucci and kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds but o hurley and mcdermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements released upon a fremantle dvd this largely lustreless affair depicting a man neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top flight visual and sound quality and although no extra features are provided the above average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer robert primes and composer stephen edwards 
most of the episodes on season are awful there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limits as they programs actually had decent story lines most of amazing stories are well dull not amazing in the least go rent or buy the twilight zone series i have heard season of this series is much better also for some reason on the dvd s they cut out the ray walston parts which further diminishes this compilation the one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering 
this film has its good points hot chicks people die the problem the hot chicks barley get nude and you don t get to see many of the people dieing mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes also for those of you watching this for jenna jameson she is just a side chearator with a very small role and minor nude scenes what this film needed script and story would be nice but i will not complain about that simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks i wouldn t waste my money on it and if you must wait until it s on the old shelves at your local video store
he pulled the guys guts out his butt that s a spoof right no one really writes that it just happens like improv gone horribly wrong i think any way this movie must be a spoof because who would say they wrote that script otherwise can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting around as the director and writers go over the storyboard director says next our inbreed villain uses his inch machete to disembowel our token creepy neighbor get this he is going to pull the guts out his bunghole brilliant the entire cast proclaims no way can that happen nobody writes that stupid gotta be a spoof i loved the part where the skinny introspective gal beats the inbreed freak to death with the cast iron skillet she finds on the floor of the cave i wasn t sure the inbreed cannibal types bothered to cook much maybe that explains why the skillet was lying on the floor in the dark at just the right time to kill the malformed hulk seems ironic that after the freaky guy had bested martial arts expert porn queens and a couple out doors type jocks he falls so easily to the frying pan of a skinny defenseless girl next door what the heck is that richard greco guy doing in this did he fire his agent or something can anyone explain the ending to me please because i didn t get it either i can t quite figure why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who was making her some tea never mind i don t want to know 
did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what sound effects background music and the editing in general was so bad you d think some year old wanna be made the film most of the acting was good considering the script the innocent virgin played her part really well the mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel but unfortunately for all involved that s not the case turn left was made better than this movie and those guys didn t even have any money good thing i didn t rent the movie myself 
make a you sacks of german staples well when i started to watch this sack of crud it was a sunday afternoon and i was just looking for stuff on show time i was introduced to a hot naked babe and like any guy im a guy the e mail is my sisters i was happy but then they threw it all to the dogs spit on it lit it on fire and peed it out you wanna know how the dumb chick talked the dialog throughout the film was just horrible sounded like something my nd grade bro could wright the violence was nice for some scenes but some was just totally moronic the scene in the pit were he gives the guy the knife dumb moron to sum it up this is pure cinema barf drenched in the chocolate syrup known as nudity and topped with the cherry of horrible acting as only a porn star could deliver 
i had to register for imdb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie is my cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this not the worst acting i ve ever seen but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within minutes it leaves a bit to be desired there wasn t a single scare moment in the movie with the exception of when they were watching the movie halloween on the tv all around it seems like it could ve been a good story rolling the credits and saying that chasey lain was in it was a bit of a loss as i didn t recognize her right away and her scene was already over before i could ve said oh yeah there she is i m so glad i saw this in a hotel and didn t pay for it as i d be real ticked if i had payed a cent to see this i normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie but this one is an exception it s so bad that it s not even that amusing so good it s bad it s just plain bad 
i m in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of pirated movies this gem came along with other movies and this is easily the worst i ve seen in a long time i ve seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn t take itself too seriously but really i think that s a cover up for the fact that its horrible it s not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you haven t seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you ll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to clich visual ie opening credits to the adobe premier special effects they couldn t even get blanks for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if you re going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin don t let stunt folk act they can t also the comment about this being a return of old vampire movies no it s not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire slayer blade underworld they re all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the newest vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because it s better than i could do of course i also know i can t make movies so i don t try i do know how to watch movies though i work hour nights days a week i ve seen several thousand in the year i ve been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack 
first of all jenna jameson is the best actress in this movie and she s just awful this movie has every horror move clich in imagination and all badly played the over sexed teen couple the comical not horny jock the snotty cool chick the creepy local color guy the parental type couple the virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films the dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool it s almost like you re wishing that they d all die sooner i saw the rough cut of this film a while ago but somehow this just got worse sure the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat jameson s implants but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog avoid at all costs 
yes definitely better than my viewing of death tunnel actually some of the deaths were pretty original and the gore was decent it was kind of like wrong turn meets the hills have eyes but when the kids high school or college are discussing horror movies in the kitchen everything shae says is almost an exact quote from scream the thing about the big breasted girls etc was steve not a bootleg randy from scream besides the fact that it took place in october what the hell did the movie have to do with samhain pretty unnecessary if you ask me i find it humorous when i see those horror movies from the s that explain away loose ends by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagram wow they made a sam raimi reference why was gary and his sister in the movie they re characters had nothing to do with anything and hes so psychic that he couldn t even see his own death when gary was being killed in the bathroom at that point the deaths became simply troma licious how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs but not hear them when she was standing outside the door gary s sister commented on haggis thats primarily a scottish dish not irish so the lesson is if you are like shae and don t have any fun or crack a smile through the whole film you ll be the one to live the mutants were pretty cool but they looked like walking dishes of chili con carne when they brought in gary s sister did they forget that steve had been strapped there and wonder where he went was there not more than one killer shae beat that one but never encountered any more of them what was with the flashbacks to those other people half of them shae didn t know if they were dead or alive so what was with that why didn t they kill gary and his sister before why did no one ever call the police and apparently everybody knew those people lived in the woods why did they never organize some kind of raid as far as i know they were not zombies or vampires so how could she turn into one at the end i m with everyone else on the giant huh at the end way better than death tunnel but still quite sloppy i still don t understand why they even placed it in ireland considering samhain had close to nothing to do with the plot 
understand i m reviewing the film i have seen i realize virtually all the nudity and gore was cut from this film thus neutering it completely when seeing names like ginger lynn and jenna jameson attached i knew i wasn t going to get a horror classic but at the very least i expected gratuitous boobies and bloodshed but no this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film i mean it s easy to tell there is much more to certain scenes but they suddenly cut away or the scene just totally ends right as it begins how does one screw up cannibals and porn stars i mean thats a winning formula it makes me wonder if the director slept with some executive s wife or something because it is literally amazing how much got cut from this reading about it a few years back in fangoria i was excited it looked like a fun film but unfortunately the true film is locked in a vault somewhere and we must endure this piece of excrement retitled evil breed hopefully an unrated cut will be released someday as i think a good movie exists in this mess but until then best grab a twelve pack of bud cause thats the only way you ll make it through this movie 
justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside let s just take this movie as it s offered without extraneous explanations this movie is god awful straight up craptastic rather than rehash what may serve as a plot i ll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head a class of take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin nowhere ireland these students may be canadian or american it s difficult to tell that it was filmed in a canadian forest rather than ireland is rather obvious as well one student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the dumb jock character from a number of kick ass s movie except when he channels randy from scream one character may be chris klein s stunt double he has a girlfriend who probably gets killed but it s never really established if that is true one character is sullen and removed from her peers just cuz and then there s a blonde girl yay blonde girl ireland has a population of they re cousins gary who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast is called sir more than once he s very ominous and wears a knit cap his cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond picturesque ireland features many canadian forests and swampy areas and ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes the producers got a discount on volume fake entrails good for them unbeknownst to me horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives perhaps there s some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register also unbeknownst to me if you inbreed for roughly years as the story leads us to believe happened you end up being somewhat lumpy yet amazingly spry and fairly strong genetics are a wonderful game of craps there may or may not be more than one freak in this film reference is made to them and we see shadows yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever and when one odd looking dude is finally killed apparently all danger is passed i m running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up thus they just used the one that s what it looks like on screen anyway richard grieco should be ashamed also of note aside from those shiny new knives the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear as once richard grieco cuts his bonds there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up who also then escapes because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up a dead body in a shack will be maggot ridden after what i would guess is about hours has passed said dead body will also have glasses on when no characters wore them curious jenna jameson appears for no reason from stage left chats for minutes vanishes stage left in the middle of a giant forest that s not unusual as gary can also pop out of nowhere which is also known as whatever exists in tv land off the screen ms jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldn t suck wind i offer a special nod to the breeder character the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months or maybe years for breeding purposes the poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua the ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years apparently this wasn t just random crap i found on the movie network late at night apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it s production how sad for you all i have nothing more to say may god have mercy on us all 
tourists head to ireland for a school trip to learn about druids what they encounter is a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers if i had to sum up evil breed it would be a low grade gore fest the film mixes dead alive evil dead wrong turn all in one it s just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any fun one would have watching it the film has lots of random horror nudity although the film also stars four porn stars yup four so there could have been plenty more breed also showcases a good amount of gore evil breed has a horrible start with laughable dialogue and horrible acting that s a given in a straight to video horror film but this takes the cake i can t really figure out who the main character is since the one female who lives at the end is not really in the movie all that much speaking of the ending that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film it has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes one s view of the film you have to see this film to believe it since there are some pretty great death scenes there are two death scenes that come into my mind one in which the inbred killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest yea her chest don t ask me the other id when the guy gets his intestines yet again ripped out through his asshole does that kill the guy no the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines these scenes remind me so much of dead alive with the right amount of humour in each i also got the sense of evil dead with the pointless mentions of horror films and sam raimi along with halloween when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately y to get in although the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film when the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots distracting indeed as well as the continuity in the film with only one inbred killer as well as which character dies at which moment i couldn t tell if the breast implant chick was jenny or gary s sister cousin i can t remember as well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body still attached with the umbilical cord the horrible editing is distracting as well the opening credits are too fast and disorienting it did have a bad start and got better but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level if maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film then it wouldn t have been horribly butchered to death stay away from this film unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore 
oh this is so bad it is funny the only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun i mean you get to see porn actresses topless having sex then killed by human mutants there is plenty of gore including the classic something is wrong with her oh no it s half the person she used to be and the accidental murder caused by panic but you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someone s ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees that makes a metallic doiiing sound afterward like in cartoons somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn they really need to know what s inside an actress mere genitals are not enough therefore you get to see plenty of summary autopsies on slain bimbos there is no dialog jenna and chasey have really small parts and i really wonder what richard grieco wanted when accepting a role here i think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy stuff just to be reminded of the old school c class horror movies 
the only remarkable fact is the participation of klaus kinski who plays a priest don t ask me why he does it a bad bad movie overall 
i am a big fan of the spaghetti western genre and i usually also like most of the cheaply made ones infamous director demofilo fidani however is rightly known for some of the cheapest trashiest and well worst contributions to the genre the plots of fidani s movies were usually very weak and since his talent was quite limited he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous spaghetti western names like django of sartana to the titles i the particular case of gi la testa hombre of he just took the title of sergio leone s gi la testa aka duck you sucker and added hombre the movie can be found under various titles fistful of death western story i personally bought it under the name adios companeros which this movie shares with another fidani film with almost the same cast per una bara piena di dollari which is also entitled adios companeros in the german language version the plot is rather weak it basically follows a guy named macho callaghan jeff cameron and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by butch cassidy jack betts and ironhead gordon mitchell the leading performance by jeff cameron is kindly stated not very convincing neither did i find jack betts very good as butch cassidy b movie legend gordon mitchell however is always worth a try and although he probably wasn t a very good actor i always found his performances in the spaghetti westerns quite funny and original and he actually saved some of fidani s movies such as the rather crappy django and sartana showdown in the west there is one very funny and original thing about gi la testa hombre the great klaus kinski is playing a priest i could have imagined kinski in any role but before seeing this movie i would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest kinski is once again great although he has only little screen time and one scene where he breaks up a fight is probably the only good scene in this one more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze joe d amato did the cinematography gi la testa hombre is a cheap crappy film but nevertheless it has some funny moments being a spaghetti western enthusiast i found it fun to watch but if you re not never mind this movie or watch it only for the purpose of seeing kinski play a priest 
a quite usual trashy italo western stupid storyline full of clich s and lack of logic some mediocre actors dirty settings lots of punch fights and people shoot dead on a massive scale this has nothing to do with django at least not in my german translated version this german dvd release is called adios companeros and has macho callaghan fighting against butch cassidy and ironhead because their gang killed his one he s the only survivor then you have butch cassidy and ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the gang split and you have ironhead fighting against everyone because he s just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway yeah that s it no more cleverness in the storyline hehe a small role by klaus kinski as reverend cotton is remarkable that s why i bought this dvd in one scene he attempts to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming i said love and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts for a second fantasticfantasticfantastic it s also remarkable that joe d amato aka aristide massaccesi did the cinematography i love this master of incompetent exploitation thrash so it was an aahhh for me 
i really have problems rating this movie it is directed brilliantly there is obviously a lot of money in it gere and danes are intense although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up editing and cinematography are excellent on the other hand it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes and yes one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspire in purely artistic terms it is a but i really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie 
a bad rip off attempt on seven complete with sub second grade acting awful camera work half baked story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda yeah them sex offenders they live next door and you re gonna get raped really no surprises from the vice terminatrix woman she acts as always as convincingly as a piece of wood richard gere keeps on sliding lower and lower and is about as low here as a late steven seagal the singer woman with the crazy eyes is best when she s dead in bed and even the wolf was sub par although she was the best performer in the movie maybe they fed her before the shots or something unlike seven which had a made up but interesting story to which one could relate more or less regardless of the country this movie seems to focus on a us only obsession if one doesn t care much about sex offenders and the statistics are that lack of exercise and bad diet cause more pain suffering and death there is little reason to see it or to be afraid there are some body part fetishes and some snuff but the gore is less then mediocre and fails both as artistic device because it is pointless and as gore because it is not gory enough don t waste time on this one 
the flock is not really a movie it s a wannabe movie with wannabe actors not including richard gere he gave an excellent performance but when only one of the actors truly gives himself to his character and the rest of the cast is just acting the result is pathetic just like this movie you see the idea of acting is to hide the fact that you re acting what the hell was claire dains doing in this one she s the most inappropriate actress for this character in of the movie she looked extremely out of place out of everything the only thing she was doing was asking stupid questions like do you really think so and making silly faces i was embarrassed by her acting seriously and i used to like her she s the romantic movie type i don t know who picked her among all the actresses out there lol and seeing avril lavigne this really made me laugh anyway if you want to get the feeling of throwing up this movie will do the job for you i wish i could vote 
i just saw this film yesterday my girlfriend wanted to see it only because of richard gere i feel i wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it s the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actor actress is in it i hope she learned the lesson because i had trouble keeping her in her seat as of me since i paid already i wanted to see the end at least just in the hope something good would turn up but i didn t hold my breath and luckily so cause i would have been a victim of the film just the same this is not a black and white film it s a black and black one the main character richard gere is almost as bad as his registrants and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad speak of a clich and the exploitation of a typical us phobia richard gere s acting was good as usual but the blond girl that s supposed to replace him was wishy washy at best totally unconvincing for the job the film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap dramatic and sensational turn that just is unreal they just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murders vigilante beating rape and torture something that almost seems gratuitous they even have a wolf attacking people in the film how low can you get i gather the film won t come out in the usa and will go straight to dvd that s were it should have stayed in other countries too but because it s hollywood and richard gere they just had to show it believe me without gere the film is not even worth a b series movie 
in the title i write that the story is ludicrous below i ll elaborate and tell you why it in my humble opinion ruins this movie gere and danes are doing their jobs and while it s not their best work it s quite ok the rest of the cast though is doing a really poor job mind you this is not entirely the actors fault the problem is that gere and danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth all other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth or the character is such a clich that it doesn t matter how hard the actors try the director has a bit of a se en complex but looking merely at the direction i think he does an ok job but the story this is the kind of script that is bad in two ways first of all it s a bad movie script the characters are shallow except for gere s and danes characters the villains are clich s and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable besides this the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years it s the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them it s also the kind of movie that says albeit only between the lines that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial judge or jury and of course according to the movie everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance so if you re going to film school and need an example of a bad script or if you re writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost see it for everyone else i recommend another movie 
it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing the first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go you shouldn t really decide to watch this based on my review or not i saw so little of it i shouldn t even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it couldn t they have just made earnest does dallas 
i only lasted mins before self preservation jerked me out of the empty eyed drooling stupor that this film effortlessly induced and propelled me screaming back to the video shop armed for bear to say the film was bad would be a missed opportunity to use words interspersed with characters from the top keys on my keyboard just to keep these comments clean one to be avoided 
this is really terrible the only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie i have ever watched i would have a suitable reply i think it is filmed on mm so it is already tacky like hell i wouldn t have bothered commenting but i noticed some fanboys probably connected to the movie had claimed that this was the best movie since the matrix let me debunk the myths and lies there is nothing good in the movie everything yells tacky the actress is ugly the fight choreography is the worst i have ever seen the fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn t hurt a kitten obviously the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie i know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before unforgivable 
 a friend of mine enjoys watching the worst films he can possibly find and i have a good laugh watching them with him i have told him if he puts this one on again i will be forced to give him a good kicking he knows i am serious 
you should know that i am the type of person that watches even the worst of movies to the finish often out of sheer morbid curiosity i even watched leprechaun to the end before giving in to the temptation of tearing out my eyes and stamping on them you should also know that this movie was in my vcr for less than half an hour before i made a frantic leap for the stop button and dashed back the rental store just to put as much distance between me and it as possible 
words fail me this film was extremely difficult to watch and in hindsight i really wish i hadn t done it although i attempted to sit through it until the end credits i have to admit i couldn t last for more than hour so my opinion could be unfair however this film would require the most impressive final third in the history of film making in order for it to be given a review which is anything but vicious please do not watch any part of this film 
i may have seen worse films than this but i if i have i don t remember or possibly blocked them out who knows if i was to undergo hypnotherapy i may remember them along maybe with been abducted by aliens as a child or other traumas if so i would happily exchange those memories for the ones i have of watching this film i should give the film some credit it did produce an emotional response i actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and tv programs that this travesty was dirtying them by association i am terrified that i may be unable to watch films like dr strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye 
if you really truly want to waste two hours of your life do the following look through the tv listings find the movie men in white when men in white comes on sit and watch and that s it after sitting through two hours of bad puns dreadful and not that funny movie references and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history you will have wasted two hours of your life and wonder exactly why why did i do this i was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good it wasn t but on the other hand if you re old enough to remember power rangers you might spot some familiar faces during the film presumably to save on production costs saban who also make power rangers decided to liberally sprinkle old monster costumes from everyone s favourite tacky toy spawning franchise throughout the film i spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes i saw from when i was a kid so i guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia value but if you want to see actual power rangers monsters go watch power rangers itself it s much better than this piece of garbage and that s saying something 
if you see this turkey listed in your tv guide avoid it like the plague a steaming great pile of fetid dingoes kidneys doesn t begin to describe how bad this movie is there is only one funny scene the memory eraser scene but even that rates only on the laughometer out of whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire lives 
although properly warned i actually sat down to watch this movie in part because i usually give every movie an even break and because i thought that a single movie couldn t be that bad i stand corrected not even george kennedy barry bostwick or ben stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did i laugh namely during the simon says scene the other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny and some of them you actually see coming a mile away this movie just hasn t got what it takes to be a good parody like airplane i ii naked gun i ii iii or scary movie they all had a funny gags b good dialog and most important of all c unforgettable quotes men in white has got d none of the above to call this movie bad would be a gross understatement avoid this movie anyway you can consider yourselves warned 
from the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes keanu i m so wooden i could be a plank me reeves look like an oscar winner this film bites pun not intended the best thing about it is the box of eraticate in the nd segment which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and twist wish i d spent the it cost me on something else like erm natural born killers directors cut if you do buy this you re really in for a disappointment do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague if you re looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a x then go ahead however if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere like dog soldiers wolfen romasanta the werewolf hunt 
really bad shot on video film made by not one not two but three amateur video makers if you re going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood gore and nudity there is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a halloween store there are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex the lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking there seems to be no editing effects fades wipes etc once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end credits the werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the actors face they didn t even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks arms or wrists i guarantee a year old with a video camera could put together a better movie no reason at all to buy rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video 
 spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty nobody should love that lucius shepard the color purple takes place in the deep south during the early s and tells the story of celie and nettie two african american sisters the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather this motif innocence interrupted by men permeates the entire film the film then launches into a series of short sequences celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather gives birth in a dirty barn has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly forcing her to cook clean and look after his children all these horrific scenes are given little screen time and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography a meddlesome symphonic score incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes ten minutes he lasted a long time the film is often said to deal which racism sexism and black culture but this is not true alice walker the author of the novel upon which the film is based claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian her book is a lesbian fantasy a story of female liberation and self discovery which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women for walker the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia black sisterhood and female independence celebrated spielberg s film however re frames walker s story through the lens of comforting american mythologies this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins stereotypical fat mammies jazz bands and gospel choirs this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike readily and happily accepting their social conditions a film in which black people are over sexed carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept this is not the old south this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind mgm muscals song of the south warner cartoons halleluha and banned disney movies in other words it s the south as seen by a child raised on s tv it s all so cartoonish so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy of course in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed this reconciliation was in walker s novel but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin beyond walker s hate letter to black men and spielberg s bizarre caricaturing of black life we are shown nothing of the black community we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community instead spielberg s camera jumps about desperately fighting for our attention one of celie s kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a home alone movie every emotion over played the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by couple this with quincy jones ridiculously white music and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams problematic too is the lack of white characters consider this the men in this film aren t portrayed as being rough to each other nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood no they are cruel by nature and the women whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed rather it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors women unable to support themselves and their children alone and so there s a hidden ideology at work here late in the film one character tells another that since he didn t respect his wife she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you won t run afoul of the dominant white culture a failure to confront sex and lesbianism inappropriate musical numbers countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz incongruous comic business emphatic music cues and wildly hyped emotionality all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless 
being a ni supporter it s hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists characters who are hard to root for typical heavy handed anti violence messages and a predictable poetic justice ending makes this an awkward watch 
was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie the character leon is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore some movies can get away with the sexual jokes and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie scary movie was stupid and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual jokes the only role besides leon that had some humor that followed was will ferrell the character really was dumb and that was all the dumb humor was all that had me watching the movie was ok and nothing else i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show the skits last about minutes and if they can make a movie off a minute skit then what is the world coming to molly shannon had superstar cheri o terri had scary movie but she wasnt a leading role and will had elf but that was good but he did some dumb movie but i cant remember and mike myers with wayne s world how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals seen only one guy break through but only in like movies and a tv show with andy dick but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue funny or not this movie is not good but had some positive humor what a waste of film and people s money d d 
i rented this tape a couple of years ago and boy did it suck from the commercials i was lead to believe that this was a movie about a guy who had no no luck with women and that was where the comedy would lie boy was i wrong the jokes were vulgar and they were just not funny don t bother 
i think i laughed twice the line where the main character says something about being from the streets and then i forget the other time i laughed it was probably in the beginning this has to be one of the thinnest movies ever doesn t hollywood realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad really you can only insult yourself so many times 
i honestly don t understand how tripe like this gets made the worst junior high talent show skit you ve ever seen is more entertaining than this film will ferrell s wrestling fetish provides the only briefly humorous moments utterly horrible 
the ladies man is a funny movie there s not much thought behind it but what do you expect from an snl movie it s actually better than most snl movies i e superstar or a night at the roxbury tim meadows and will ferrell were both very funny chris parnell was also funny in his short scene one of the funnier ones in the movie other than that the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support meadows i ve definitely seen funnier movies but i ve seen dumber ones too again it s not exactly a deep movie but it s good for a few laughs it was funnier as a skit though but still if you re looking for a pretty funny movie i d recommend this one just don t think about it too much or you ll hate it rating 
this film was very well advertised i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it then i went and saw it i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie i always go into a movie with an open mind not trying to go into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny now it wasnt the worst movie i ve ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see meet the parents instead 
when i decided to watch the barbarians starring those twin bodybuilders peter and david paul i thought it couldn t be that bad because the film was directed by ruggero deodato who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies well the barbarians is remarkably trashy action adventure movie that wants to be another conan the barbarian and fails at every level the look of the film is all wrong some scenes were well shot but the tone and the schintzy tacky disco look of the clothes and hair people are adorned with just doesn t make any sense whatsoever even for a low budget flick like this one richard lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdo and costume he s supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon and it s funny to see eva larue callahan one of the stars of all my children appear in her first movie walking around in skimpy fur bikini i m sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth the so called barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but it s almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are like everything else in this mess really ill conceived the only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass while the other twin s loincloth barely covers his muscular butt i m not kidding don t ask me who s who though deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film and his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick it s just bad 
the movie is basically a boring string of appalling clich s which do not offer a real cross cultural insight the middle eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way there obviously are mud brick villages dirt tracks in the middle of the desert women clad in black robes and belly dancers i wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture the personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible the original idea might have been interesting but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight you should skip this movie 
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot is awful and the acting is worse the jokes that are attempted absolutley suck don t bother to waste your time on a dumb movie such as this and if for some reason that you do want to see this movie don t watch it with your parents 
this may very well be the worst movie i ll see if i live to be i think a group of first graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this i m dumber for having watched it and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film and after i finally turned it off i actually had the urge to vomit no one had a clue about photography when made this no one had a clue about acting no one had a clue about just about anything i can t believe f x shows this crap on occasion the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz channels not even the main one and it was on at about a m at that 
this is not so much film as big budget children s television as far as i can tell the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as insomnia when it s first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia i thought wow a nihilistic martial arts film but no such luck although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man s long white eyebrows zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off that s not a good sign i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena warrior princess primitive 
the movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story kill kill would have been nice the movie incorporates taboo scenes to make the viewer move back in their chairs the scenes are unnecessary and choppy the movie is something a novice screen writer could have conjured just a waste of movie props and network money i have to write lines of text to critique this film when it is not worth lines of my time but i have to push on to let the people know to avoid the nonsense if people are counting on you to choose a good movie for movie night pick something else if you have a soul don t damage it by subjecting yourself to this filth 
for the knowledgeable beatles fan the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws inaccuracies combined events omitted events wildly exaggerated events omitted people timeline errors mis attribute quotes incorrect clothing out of place songs and shame shame incorrect instruments and other boners i just cant think of right now the flaws come fast and furious so you ll have to be on your toes i didn t give this a primarily due the fact that it is filmed in liverpool and the actors the band rain give it their all the lennon character is credible and does a good job also the song cry for a shadow is heard at one point and that counts for something so watch it for fun but please don t take it as historically accurate 
weak plot unlikely car malfunction and helpless fumbling characters at first i thought this movie was made during the seventies since the picture quality as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old kojac episode when i checked and found that it was really made as late as i was astonished this is by far one of the worst and least thriller movies i have ever seen if you read this be advised if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting like watching paint dry 
watching this movie made me think constantly why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes there are a million options to slow down the car in the movie speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn t able to stop there aren t many good things to say about this film all the usual narrative cliche s make their appearance the actors are very bad the story is as leak as a sieve etc that makes this movie a waste of time and money 
quite one of the worst films i have ever seen terrible acting laughable action it s clear that the cars are travelling slowly atrocious script hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie we know judge reinhold is a fine actor but he should be ashamed of this detritus there is no great tension within the car and when the characters stumble upon moments of hope they laugh like inane banshees for some reason even high five ing when they see the bridge lowered also the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility apparently based on true events though if that s the case truth is evidently stranger than fiction unfortunate then that it was portrayed in such an inept manner 
this film blanc classic tale of smoldering passion has achieved its well deserved legendary status as one of the screen s greatest sagas of a doomed and hopeless love the pervasive ongoing and progressive magnetism between judge reinhold and what s her name is sure to set many a viewer s heart a flutter with memories of one s own first crush the brilliant screenplay dangles this embryonic affair to be in front of the enraptured audience sitting transfixed as the abstract almost expressionist cinematography deep focuses on the just under the surface desires that ebb and flow between the principals you can cut the sexual tension with a dull tire iron a tiny drop of perspiration on the end of a nose catches the bright sunshine and leaves no doubt as to its significance scenes like this abound and bear watching again and again as with jane eyre and rebecca to which this masterpiece is so often compared the closeups of the actors faces as they experience the slow dawning of the great love that is not to be will haunt you forever the now classic rc soundtrack score with its creative and unique use of solo synthesizer emphasizes the emotion that drips throughout like a leaky crankcase if i had any criticisms at all by mentioning what i consider a minor flaw and dared to risk the wrath of the millions of fans who hold this classic so dear to their hearts i would say that the hallmark of runaway car its sense of mounting sexual tension is briefly broken by the highway scene which now after repeated viewings seems just a bit overlong and probably even unnecessary to the eternal bittersweet tale of love interrupted dare i advance what i perceive as the tiniest of flaws in this critically acclaimed triumph of modern cinema citizen kane had its rosebud runaway car should have its catchword as well perhaps the film could have opened with an extreme closeup of judge reinhold saying something such as a car is an extension of its owner and the rest of the storyline could then be dedicated to parsing every syllable subtlety and nuance of that phrase had that plot line been done this film could have topped titanic at the golden globes that year i m convinced my one regret that i didn t read the novel first 
imagine its say am your at home your bored your not tired this scenario occurred about say or so years back i turned on the tv and flicked over a few channels and found that this film was on oh my word this is the worst film i have ever seen a runaway car that cant be stopped cos the brakes have been cut or something in caning it down the freeway whats gonna happen this film was so bad its actually funny i think the stunts cost about to make there was one instance where a baby small child is being winched from the car by a helicopter in an attempt to excite the viewer a conveniently placed bridge is nearing ahead this is the best bad bit of a film ever it shows the child narrowly missing the bridge but it looks so bad you can almost see the make of the dummy that they used total low budget classic cant remember the end of the film though but i bet it was great i doubt they will ever show this film again so i m glad i got to see this piece of trash 
ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the s i was shocked to find out it was released in secondly the plot was all over the place right off the bat the story is confusing had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would ve been better also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much it was bizarre and badly filmed the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand i love chinese epic films but if you re looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise visually stunning the plot is interesting and good character development not this film beware you will be disappointed 
this became a cult movie in chinese college students though i havnt watched it until it is broadcasted in channel uk full of arty giddy pretentions the plot is mediocre and unreal the spirit it wants to convey is how independent artists resist the commercisliation of music industry and maintain their purity of an artistic soul and wouldnt sell themselves for dirty money that is really giddy and superficial the diologue are mainly pathetic acting is poor sceenplay is full of art pretention it is a fantasy movie for kids and that s all 
 spoiler alert soooo arnie s really a good guy but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders he s sent to jail or rather some sort of work camp he escapes but after a short while he s caught once again this time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he s supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes and eventually die but we all know arnie and we all know that he s tougher than even the toughest of tough guys i really wanted to like this movie being an arnie fan and all however the running man contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me e g the reconstruction of arnie s fight inside the helicopter where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident complete with different camera angles this means that the military helicopter in which arnie flew was equipped with almost cameras filming the crew members one of which _inside_ the eye of one of the crew members arnie beats there are other flaws also and the plot which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative works for a while then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns the acting can t really be said to be anything better than sub par with arnie in the leading role doing an average arnie performance the rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad the special effects are ok without being impressive rating 
i am probably one of the few who actually read stephen king s book the one this movie was based on after reading this excellent work i could not wait to see the movie version of it after viewing the movie i was totally disappointed the only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters in the book schwarzenegger s character is put on a game show the main object is to survive but he s not in an arena he s set loose in the city and has to escape the game show s i guess you d call them villians who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters this premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax the movie was absolute garbage there was no cinematic quality to it i totally respect arnold schwarzenegger as an actor but he messed up with this one 
it is unbelievable that a script as clich and completely absurd could make any screen even the small one the dialogue in this movie makes catwoman seem like a high culture classic billy zane plays the bad ass harmonica playing elvis impersonating gunslinging martial arts master who gambles on the life of a down an out former football player turned gambling addict played by the winner of nbc s craptastic show next action star his performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way the film takes place in vegas and since people play poker there the writers felt it was a perfect setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive hours against an omnipresent wealthy gambler who has offered his target million if he can make it through the day and so the hunt ensues a hunt reeking with unimpressive explosions construction yard settings shoddy cinematography and one liners containing the word bet or gamble the female winner is also tossed in the mix but for what reason i have no idea oh but don t worry nas fans the losers make their memorable cameos as well the surprise ending will knock your socks off if you love predictability or plagiarism joel silver should reevaluate his decision to sell out even more i wish he could give me those two hours of my life back 
hah so this is the movie that the next action stars were getting into well i m glad that i didn t participate and didn t win isn t it funny how one can just look at the first seconds and make up ones mind about a movie i mean come on just look at those titles i watched this movie or part of this teleplay since it was produced for tv and we couldn t bear to watch the whole thing one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodge podge of average guys that once in a while watch series like las vegas just for the girls in the show so the bar wasn t really high the most watched movie in my group was girl next door and it wasn t because of the great script d but this movie s total lack of originality acting scripting and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to las vegas or was it csi don t remember without any complaints by the rest of the group and that is rare for heavens sake don t by this movie if it s on tv then yes watch it and contemplate on it my conclusion well since joel silver has indeed produced some of the best action films out there die hard matrix to name some i can only say that producers don t give the film it s quality they provide money for the directors and to sell this movie just because it s a joel silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it 
wow this movie bored the pants off me when i saw it bland pointless and unmoving apparently ash and co can travel through time with the help of the spirit of the forest princess mononoke much there they meet a dorky kid named sam and the plot begins so tom ash and huck sam get high with nature become hippies and try to free celebi the spirit from some weirdo hunter guy i don t even know what else went on it all went by in a blur ash s friends were hardly in it and all the fight scenes were boring after saving the day ash and his infamous friends must return to their time while watching sam float away with celebi that scene was just creepy o o then after returning to their time ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival s grandpa and i think that s it pretty retarded isn t it if you love your children you won t expose them to this out of 
the movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon celebi but the plot was out of course and didn t have as an interest as the other movies it was a waste of money and time the same corny humor and cliche bad guys the movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make pokemon famous the movie should better not associated with animes such as dragonballz digimon or yu gi oh the drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this movie i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on pokemon digimon is more of an anime and doesn t fall anywhere close to pokemon it s second movie is coming out late 
this movie is about as underrated as police acadmey mission to moscow this movie is never funny it s maybe the worst comedy spoof ever made very boring and dumb beyond belief for those people that think this movie is underrated god help you i give this movie out of 
national lampoon s class reunion was a flop when it was released it didn t stay long in theaters in my big city why because it s bad not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way the entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this turkey the idea is actually great a parody of slasher flicks but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect just avoid this comedy your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire 
i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor i therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts her character s rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft the trip had been turned down by the us airforce navy and coast guard as beyond their capabilities the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercules 
this is it this is the one this is the worst movie ever made ever it beats everything i have never seen worse retire the trophy and give it to these people there s just no comparison even three days after watching this for some reason i still don t know why i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is was its so bad so far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence this made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society we should be ashamed i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good it s an embarrassment i don t know how on earth any of these actors writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making loaded i don t know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies that being said i love a good bad movie i love shark attack i love bad taste they are hilarious i tell all my friends to see them because they are bad but this this crosses the line of bad into a whole new dimension this is awkward bad this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen every line every action every death every sequence before they happen and not just like a second or two before i mean like after watching the first minutes before every cheesy editing effect is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point i really never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever this is meticulously boring repetitive and just tortures the audience but and let me be specific here the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of drain o or i will do it for him if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again trust me i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the nd time of sitting through this stop these movies they are just the most vile of all facets of our society please stop now 
if it wasn t for the performances of barry diamond and art evans as the clueless stoners i would have no reason to recommend this to anyone the plot centers around a year high school reunion which takes place in a supposed abandon high school looks more like a prop from a s low budget horror flick and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on this student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge john hughes falls in love with his characters too much as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady goonies anne ramsey we re led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed but never see a blasted thing this is a horrible movie that continued national lampoon s downward spiral throughout the s and s 
 out of people found this comment useful and counting people are such suckers for image and looks as much as for the intellectually hollow idealism that lurks behind communism che s charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda such as this movie about him i don t know what s worse being captured by one of che s murder squads or having to sit through hours of this typically soderberghian garbage the question isn t why this pet project was made but what took them so long by them i m referring of course to left wing hollywood and its secret love of marxist tyrants lenin castro take your pick i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltown s least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project where was oliver stone all these years robert redford tim robbins warren beatty alan pakula george clooney barbra streisand even it s a mystery all these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar politically one sided projects yet somehow che guevara who is arguably the most popular and well known communist hasn t been a film topic of theirs yet guerrilla has all the hallmarks of an american truth bending story of an epic scale there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood big budget political fairy tale bios such as malcolm x or gandhi i e almost none the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary nevertheless however controversial and criminal this man s actions may have been one thing nobody could take away from him he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family which is why del toro fits the bill only visually del toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive casting such mediocrities as bratt philips and franka incompetente only underlines the director s lack of sound judgment the movie is to the most part extremely slow no surprise there and visually uninteresting even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the hour mark so it s quite telling that this soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task if you think the film s length indicates that a bulk of che s life has been shown here then think again soderbergh focuses on che s last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of guevara s alleged idealism psychopaths don t have ideals i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of che s earlier life did he actually consider it too uninteresting a massacre of people holds no interest for the viewer huh amazing some much better directors than this over praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a hour movie soderbergh in a sense becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative dark side which is more than of guevara by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy consciously ignoring the ugly truth god forbid he should taint the holy image of che soderbergh proves himself not a humanist a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold but the opposite that he cares only about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested like on guinea pigs soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat what a stupid term they re supposedly siding with half of all students around the world wear che s image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why he has become an iconic figure for clueless uninformed very often young people who think that by having this man s face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting in reality wearing a che shirt only underlines one s overall shallowness and total disinterest in self education wouldn t you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his her face to the world wearing che s by now clich image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup all those che wearers probably know more about marge s blue hair than they ll ever read up on about fidel castro s dead ally after everything that d been done in the name of marx one would think that these mongrel ideals would be finally laid to rest it seems mankind will never learn stalin mao kim il pol pot castro milosevic ceausescu the iron curtain a hundred million dead more than a billion ruined physically and or mentally through this system so none of that matters huh the fact that del toro won a cannes award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless

the first part che in cuba is about that portion of his life it contains too many indistinguishable battles and che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded remember that che was a physician it ends as castro wins the revolution che never gets to havana the second part che in bolivia is about guess what it contains too many indistinguishable battles and che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded when i realized this was supposed to be an epic i never knew anything but the title before it started i naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all david lean s lawrence of arabia more of that later not to be a racist but aside from what i ve already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are well indistinguishable unknown hispanic actors who look alike especially considering they all wear che beards and all wear che fatigues this results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than che benicio del toro even fidel has a very minor role while del toro s terrific think of lawrence with peter o toole as the only discernible character no alec guinness no omar sharif no anthony quinn etc you get the idea because the other characters are interchangeable this results in a loss of reference when top aides of che are killed you feel no remorse since you don t know who they are even when che is killed i don t think that s a spoiler there s no empathy from the audience he s just killed he s too one dimensional to relate to as a human being aside from being a revolutionary and second only to jesus in moral rectitude the only thing we learn about che is that he s married with five children he tells another character that near the end what was his motivation a complete enigma maybe soderbergh is purposely aping lean like soderbergh s che lean never lets us know anything about lawrence the mystery man of arabia but at least lawrence had a friend sharif and associates guinness quinn he was as courageous as he was insecure i e had human qualities che is like a machine about as warm as the terminator earlier this year there was another war epic mongol che makes mongol look like it s a wonderful life 
what i found so curious about this film i saw the full hour roadshow version is how oddly dispassionate it is for a film about very charismatic men castro and che engaged in a gargantuan political struggle it s almost totally devoid of emotional fire the scenes between benicio del toro and demian bichir who is at best a second level actor with a slightly high pitched voice have no drama or depth and basically come down to castro telling che go here go there do this and that with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play castro joaquim de almeida but he s shunted aside in a minor part in the second half without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers the film becomes a dullish epic length film about hairy bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end several of the reviews i ve read showered praise on the work of director steven soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely one in fact spent more time talking about soderbergh s new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it s entirely in spanish with english subtitles this is an odd odd thing to do since a soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b it s no more than a competent job of work with an unremarked upon nod to oliver stone s jfk in the black and white cut up camera work when che visits new york if you can imagine reds directed by andrew mclaglen instead of warren beatty you d get an idea of the dull competency of this movie 
i think that s this is awful produced and directed movie benicio del toro shouldn t work in production of movies he should put accent on his acting and that s it steven soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution about it s ideals and most important about life of che guevara and so on camera is awful like someone with day working experience is shooting with it music is i don t know is there some music in the movie i will not recommended this piece of sh to no one it s just wasting about hours in front of the tv or whatever i can t figure out how can someone rate this movie more than stars disaster disaster disaster disaster don t watch please save yourself from this misery of movie 
the second half of steven soderbergh s revolutionary bio on che guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to bolivia in order to maintain his saintly visage of che soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in cuba and the folly of his congo adventure this is the history of a failure he writes in the preface of his congo journal to concentrate fully on che s attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in bolivia it would turn out to be a disaster and guevara s final act what plagued the first chapter follows suit here as soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative guevara once again being played like james dean in east of eden by bernicio del toro the problem is guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness bolivian jungle unlike werner herzog in the magnificent aguirre the wrath of god soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle s metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas he seems more concerned with keeping che s nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders there is one herzogian moment where che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall soderbergh s mise en scene remains flat sloppy and uninteresting in both of his films soderbergh shows he is clearly a che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow he spends too much time building his monument to che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga especially fidel castro making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire one would think he was steeped in enough eisenstein and vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style 
star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning this second instalment of the che films moves the story forward to the late s where the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of south america surviving without enough food and water and with tensions mounting between the group everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him down without the flitting between time and places of the last film soderbergh s second instalment focuses solely on the action in the hills and manages to be an even duller experience and more pretentiously the score has been drowned out giving the second instalment more of an unwelcome air of artsieness that proves just as alienating there s just an unshakeable air of boredom to the film that never lets up you can t fault soderbergh s ambition or del toro s drive in the lead role it s just a shame that somewhere in the production things managed to take such a disappointing turn 
what an unusual movie absolutely no concessions are made to hollywood special effects or entertainment there is no background music not special effects or enhanced sound facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire i sort of viewed these movies parts and as an educational experience not really something to go and get entertained by its quite long and in places dull but i suspect that given the lack of any plot development i don t think its very educational either its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening since for some reason the director didn t see fit to inform the audience why che s band was moving around the way they did as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at i would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end the stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare 
i went to see this movie with the most positive expectations i had seen jacquet s previous movie march of the penguins and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio however i was severely disappointed most of all this movie is terribly boring literally nothing happens i tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend and we both ended up laughing because i could only stammer things like well then the winter comes and then spring and then there s an eagle and a river and one time it is dark and the girl goes into a cave and another time the fox has babies and so on after about half an hour i began sighing yawning rolling my eyes cursing the reviewer at the radio station and hoping that it would be over soon but the movie went on and on when it finally ended i had sunken so deep into my chair that i must have looked somewhat similar to stephen hawking the most annoying parts of the movie are a the girl who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with she wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie one year and shows exactly two facial expressions joy and seriousness she is cute no question about that however a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all too human presence i found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear drown in the river or something similarly terrible b the commentary by the girl s adult voice which tells us nothing but negligible obvious boring redundant things c the music which is desperately lacking subtlety when the girl is happily jumping around the music jumps around too when the fox is threatened by an eagle the music becomes threatening too it reminded me of the very early days of film making and was just too predictable to enjoy admittedly many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it at least they got somehow involved thus my warning concerns adults only if you are over ten years old avoid this movie you can get a better and cheaper sleep in most other places 
 the fox and the child is the new film by french director luc jacquet who brought us the oscar winning documentary march of the penguins it focuses around a young girl wonderfully played by bertille no l bruneau and her blooming friendship with a fox there are some truly mesmerizing moments here badgers mucking about a lynx chasing the fox through a snow littered forest one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times however there s simply not quite enough of them beautifully shot the cinematography is dazzling the bubbly kind of look of the film is wonderful it s undeniably a very lush production the english version is narrated by kate winslet but what little dialogue there already is has been very poorly dubbed the score is also far too fluffy or at least it is for my liking and the screenplay while subtle seemingly jumps from one scenario to another ultimately leaving me almost baffled while there s a nice moral at the heart of the film and the rather quiet performance from no l bruneau is quite lovely the real star is the fox those captivating moments focusing solely around our furry little friend are tremendous however again there s simply not nearly enough of them to keep up to date with all the latest in film including reviews news discussions and more be sure to visit www mybluray com au
the one reason i remember this is that it was shown the week after nigel kneale`s brilliant quatermass serial was broadcast the trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm which had me hoping he`d be like victor caroon from the quatermass experiment stalking the streets of london no such luck because the racing game is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing i suppose if you`re a fan of dick francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late s when the sweeney had just finished and the professionals was still being produced there`s something lacking about the racing game one trailer featured a car over taking another on a motor way if it`d been a trailer for the sweeney you`d see jack regan over taking a car and beating a confession out of the slags who`d done a blag while the professionals would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside i think that sums up what`s wrong with this series
i saw this movie a couple years back i could nt sleep and there was nothing on so i peeped it what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with richard s girl while she s unconscious then jarvis s buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar by the next morning it shows richard s girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while he s still tied up then they play some happy music and the movie is finished i mean what happened did they brake up and what was she saying to those guys trouby and jarvis its to puzzling and to poor to i can t stand movies that are disturbing and don t make sense this was the worst film i ve ever seen since the s version of lord of the flies 
a routine mystery thriller concerning a killer that lurks in the swamps during the early days of television this one was shown so often when dad would say what s on tv tonight and we d tell him strangler of the swamp he d pack us off to the movies we went to the movies a lot in those days 
please humour me if you will for a minute while i read you the back of the alley cat vhs box it says that in this part of the city every street is a dead end on every corner something to buy in every alley another way to die to survive you re got to be the best just like the alley cat alley cat this lady owns the night on the streets where even the predators become victims she knows how to survive cross her and you ve run out of luck alley cat this animal is aroused now isn t that one of the most pathetic blurbs you ve ever heard in your life whoever wrote that must be insane if they thought such a awful description could tempt us into viewing the video yet unfortunately whichever faceless individual was responsible for that tragic use of english was doing their job only too well the movie contained within the little plastic case is as bad as it sounds and then some karin mani plays the title role and the script basically tells her during every given scene to either a pout like a goldfish b kick male butt or c show off her feminine attributes no complaints about the latter but in terms of the other two let s just say she isn t much of an actress and is even less convincing as a martial arts expert but even meryl streep with cynthia rothrock s body what a scary thought would fail to save this movie the unfolding of the plot is boring beyond belief as we get one ineptly directed fight sequence after enough pausing only for hysterical courtroom shenanigans and the occasional gag inducing love scene with the interestingly named robert torti the camera work also follows a similar path of shame with far too many unneeded close ups and continuity errors abound the part that i think really sums this scum bucket of a movie up is where our heroine is sexually assaulted and finds herself testifying in front of a corrupt judge while her rich kid rapist leers at her from the box not only does he get off scot free despite the overwhelming evidence against him but she herself is then jailed for daring to protest about the verdict in front of his honour behind bars she then has a group shower a lesbian crush a couple of cat fights and a nice sweaty game of volleyball before being released on bail to continue her battle this ten minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and the screenplay grinds to a halt to encompass it i can only imagine the producers wanted to add a bit more t a to the mix and came up with this needless sub plot as a means to achieving that end which kinds of begs the question is this an exploitation film or a serious drama neither is my response to that it isn t sleazy or camp enough to appeal to fans of troma style cinema and it certainly doesn t make the grade as an exploration of one woman s fight against the system purely because it is so appallingly made so who on earth would want to see it lunatics i guess or imdb reviewers who stay up till pm and watch any old rubbish on the box while trying to get to sleep sadly on this occasional i failed and the horrors will stay with me for quite some time don t make the same mistake i did have a hot milk or something 
an apparent vanity project for karin mani who as a hottie charles bronson going around wiping up the scum that mugged her parents or grandparents or something and impressing young hunks with her karate skills in a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and a moron cop throws her in jail so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortive prison dyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands blah blah blah i guess there were a lot of movies like this the script is dumber than usual if you can believe that mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would co produce her own death wish starring role and i find that type sporadically endearing but the movie is an ungainly apparatus competent actors would be wasted on the scumbag roles here and would actively undermine the fantastic mincing incompetent da and a judge that has got to be the producer s uncle 
begin spoiler fitfully funny and memorable for mr chong s literal roach smoking scene chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipe s bowl lights up coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat re loads the bowl properly re lights re tokes end spoiler alas i began to lose faith less than half way through the proceedings it occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable i have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners harold and kumar i simply prefer brighter company yet the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they the former are sober notable guest appearance by paul reubens spouting obscenities in pre pee wee form 
i was looking forward to seeing amanda peet in another good role after recently renting the whole nine yards easily worth the rental by the way but this wasn t it i remembered that the trailer for whipped was somewhat funny and the plot about three oversexed new yorker twenty somethings all falling for and getting manipulated by the charming ms peet was worth a shot so i convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me this review is my penance in the first act we have the three lead studs recounting their conquests in a diner what should have been funny or at least telling comes out rather pathetic was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of this [and while i don t mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar i kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the studs talk loudly about sexual and scatalogical details they do this every week at the same diner you would think someone would complain oh wait i forgot two other diners do notice in one scene but this is just a setup for a punchline everyone else in the diner is deaf ] the second act has the three studs all falling for mia and then developing brain rot failing to ask each other or her about what s really happening between the four of them and i kept asking myself as the studs keep acting like they have been what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date does she start out with brain rot i kept hoping for eric s character the married buddy to become something more than simply the annoying punching bag in this act his role is clearly to dispense advice on being married but why do they even bother to talk to him when they won t talk to each other and his advice sheeesh the third act resolves what plot there is but by this time i was looking at my watch my friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and i had to agree the scene that explains all was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list oh okay that s why brad had that happen and jonathan says this and what laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing even the outtakes during the credits weren t very funny ultimately i was left with nothing except a desire to warn people away from this movie rating 
the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite although turturro is an actor i generally like his luzhin often resembled a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi autistic man was annoying overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances 
for months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media so i patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about after it was over i had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the vcr for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie it essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters with the possible exception of amanda peet whose only redeemable quality is that she is amanda peet you cannot stand any of them the film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric moronic and crude the only slightly amusing character is eric whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on the final twist designed to make you laugh at the three main characters only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards peet all in all only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor 
i just watched this movie last night and i had to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film in a word don t i seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a quentin tarantino eddie murphy phase i e every other word was a curse word i don t have a problem with profuse cursing as in good will hunting provided it helps to delve more into the characters in this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional gasp or laughter from the audience the three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype the wall street jerk the coffee house jerk and the i m not gay just in touch with my feminine side slightly less of a jerk you just don t give a damn about any of them they are all shallow unredemable losers who you want to see lose for those who dare this film does have a couple funny moments the very beginning and the very end the toilet vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda uh yeah way really though i would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies 
first and foremost zorie barber zeke might be one of the worst actors i have ever seen as a character that s supposed to be a hip village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious why is he so hyper over dramatic and plain horrible did he know anything about his character before they started filming did the director don t the martial arts teach discipline aside from that this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen it already gross out humor hand in toilet i trainspotting i masturbation hmm i fast times at ridgemont high i i american pie i the list goes on bad dialogue in one sequence eric says it s none of my business i but i and seconds later mia says why is this any of your business bad editing at least five minutes worth of film are wasted on nyc traffic shots hr it s also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight knit group of friends in any world i can t comment on what makes everyone laugh but if you enjoy low brow basic bathroom humor and insults by all means enjoy if you want something a little smarter but on the same lines see i boomerang i if you want a solid what goes around romantic comedy go for i the tao of steve i but anyone who thinks i whipped i is witty and an accurate portrayal dating well i cannot agree at all 
every sunday a trio of buds get together at a nyc diner to boast about their sexual conquests of the night before sometimes they re joined by a newlywed ex comrade and hoochie hunter who hangs on them like a puling barnacle they re unabashed horn dogs corn dogs and mia who witnesses them on the prowl decides that they need to be taught a lesson dammit ergo she ll date and dump why not all three of them gasp what a wild idea what a radical naughty gal women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to as much as men do even there is one solitary laughable element in whipped namely the fact that not once during the amigo s detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they trash do the other customers in the diner turn around and say dude we re trying to eat here indeed a heh heh gag has an older lady eagerly weigh in on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages a big fat kermit the frog sheesh to that it s truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting a smart cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop out ending p s whip oosh sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase you go girl it was tired in and it s tired now save your time and watch some sex and the city reruns 
i m not a huge star trek fan but i was looking forward to this i was intrigued by the pre hype descriptions of the enterprise its cramped submarine styling and rough edged technology compared to the treks we are used to i didn t see anything all that interesting in this pilot i found the plot to be convoluted and confusing i will admit that i did like some of the character development the depictions of the humans as an adolescent species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining and that vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack but i don t think i m going to get hooked on this series 
four best friends young male chauvinist pigs with the emphasis on pigs meet weekly at a nyc diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable whipping although the film s premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had overall the flick doesn t work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the crux of the story one of those one man band flix with a dozen producers whipped is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think the man show is emmy material 
a poorly written script with no likeable characters as for it being a comedy i forgot to laugh it s about conceited friends who scam to get women in too bed with them no sex scenes and another friend who is semi discustingly weird who sometimes also scams but mainly is considered as being the guy who masterbates the friends separately meet and fall for the same woman amanda peet somehow this is done without really any romance the guys stop being friends as they separately dated her she scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women a bad movie
i ll be blunt and to the point this film is not good at all the film buff part of me hated the acting script story direction and almost all of the editing amanda peet has proven that she can act as she was a high point of the whole nine yards so she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole however the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny if you can forget about how underpar the production quality is and if you find smut jokes funny then you should be all right and for those of you who can t get off your pedestal thats your choice my inner child hasen t died and i laughed a fair bit even then only a out of ten because as a movie it really does stink 
it s unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and busy but scratchy background score that accompanies this release although sound came into general use in there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman unhappily married who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife s lover in a frenzy of jealousy he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment losing his nerve it s probably the most tension filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow moving and obviously contrived story hedy lamarr is given the sort of close up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love aribert mog the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim the swimming scene is very brief discreetly photographed and not worth all the heat it apparently generated the love making scene later on is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film artfully so more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece not so it s disappointing primitively crude in its sound portions including the laborious symphonic music in the background and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b mayer saw the film and on the basis of it gave her a career in hollywood he must have seen something in her work that i didn t it s apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work the jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed it fails to end the film on the proper note 
this is possibly the most boring movie in history i was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor director roman polanski i think i would rather see the three amigos than ever watch this movie again it promptly went from the dvd player straight into the garbage my apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked new coke as well i am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie it is slow dull and has no real plot you wait for minutes for the movie to get started i understand this was made in however this was an era of bad television all around thank god disco and three s company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the bay city rollers oh well just my thoughts 
this movie is terrible the suspense is spent waiting for a point there isn t much of one aside from a few great lines i found a tooth in my apartment and the main characters dedication to killing himself it s a collection of supposedly eerie sounds 
extremities aspect ratio sound format mono a woman turns the tables on a would be rapist when he mounts an assault in her home and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police in which case he could be released and attack her again exploitation fans who might be expecting another rough n ready rape fantasy in the style of day of the woman will almost certainly be disappointed by extremities true farrah fawcett s character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assaults before gaining the upper hand on her attacker a suitably slimy james russo but scriptwriter william mastrosimone and director robert m young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before unveiling the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production would their final solution hold up in a court of law maybe based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after every performance the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action acing and technical credits are fine though fawcett s overly subdued performance won t play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation 
first of all this plot is way overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male crushing on the heroine plus single parent troubles and it s so predictable that you can practically recite along with it second of all i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close minded in fact i don t recall the quote exactly but i remember at one point in the movie holly says why do they have to be so uptight so classical it s really insulting how label classical music in this way third i ve went over it dozens of times but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears there just isn t any point at all and oh yeah while the actress who portrayed holly i m not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasn t as amazing as they were making it out to be especially when she was belting she was oversupporting the whole time stars 
it was a decent movie i actually kind of enjoyed it but the ending is so abrupt there is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends what happens after the concert what happens with her boyfriend does she hook up with grant does she come beck in the next semester and what about angela obviously holly s performance would knock angela down a few pegs but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts there is so much left up in the air and it s very unsatisfying i don t know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke i was very disappointed 
i actually liked this movie until the end sure it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon until the end that is for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch up to the other classically trained students what does the main character do wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition no she tortures and butchers the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable brittany spears wannabe pop song my ears bled and in the supreme moment of horror her teachers gave her a standing ovation any teacher not in a spears induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot save your time save your ears skip this movie 
here we are two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire race so what could we call this killing machine it s almost like he s some kind of destroyer or eradicator sort of like an exterminator or something what s the word i m looking for something that terminates things hmmmm anyway the protector who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from luke skywalker in favour of local clothing finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future born hero to be the evil uhhhh exterminator kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into people s eyes and repeating her name threateningly then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable exterminator pursues the couple across the countryside at some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle but i m not sure perhaps in an exciting finale he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of acid then the truck will crash they will be saved but no he will then re emerge as strong as ever he will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant where in a terrifying finish he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery and destroyed once and for all but maybe i m extrapolating too much after all i did stop watching this movie after mr protector magically impregnates sean young by kissing her at a bar then tells her the child will be born in days the costumes and effects are great in this movie i loved them the first time i saw them on star trek next generation too sean young does another great turn as an unemotive replicant and career sweat hog stephen baldwin is also on board as young s fat cop boyfriend not sure where he fits into the plot though maybe he s an import from a different james cameron movie 
okay first of all i didn t sit down to watch the premier of a star trek series to see a cowboy flying around in space this is how a normal enterprise episode works archer finds a nebula or something aloung the lines of that and wants to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship he sends a shuttle into the nebula and and the shuttle get damaged in all of the episodes i have seen all of the problems are happening because of archer s stupid mistakes oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing archer and t pol kissing i was planning to watch that episode but after that i totally gave up on enterprise and turned to tv right off come on this is star trek also what was with the banana slug in one episode hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason okay fine little dumb to bring you pet slug in space but whatever okay that was what i thought until they left it on a desert planet a banana slug cannot leave in a desert how dumb are these writers any ways just saying if enterprise is on don t watch it 
i saw this in the market place at the cannes film festival it s a real cheapo prod nothing wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both think larry cohen sean young is an interesting actor well done to the producers for hooking her i guess the opening scene in the space ship coming down is hilarious you could picture all the crew hands shaking it around ha ha but i wish the people who made this well at least it s not pretentious 
the plot certainly seemed interesting enough how can a real life brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie well you can watch wonderland and find out i had heard of the wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people unfortunately there is zero character development so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters the pace of the direction was very tedious this all leads to an extraordinarily boring movie given that dawn schiller a central character as holmes s girlfriend was an associate producer and that holmes s wife was a consultant on the film we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters 
val kilmer solid performance dylan mcdermott solid performance josh lucas solid performance three very engaging actors giving decent performances the problem is who cares about the plot john holmes infamous for his well endowments a drug addict and a guy who despite contracting aids continued to make adult films just does not make an intriguing character the story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late s in los angelos to which holmes was linked arrested and charged with murder and who ultimately was acquitted just like in the case of o j the guilt factor regardless of the outcome ranged quite high in the he did it zone there is no one to sympathize with in this film as everyone is a self serving criminal there is just nothing remotely interesting here 
unlike others i refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance i don t want to give style a bad name still it s the most apt description that comes to mind a pointless unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears wonderland leaves one wondering only why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the greenlight to this dreary and tangled mess a biography of porn star john holmes a study of who the man was why he went into the business and how it affected him great bound to be compelling bound to be entertaining bound to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million levels and i have zero interest in porn but a confusing violent rashomon style study of a series of murders holmes was connected with after his career ended who in hell cares what insights do we gain this film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of john holmes s life that he was a porno star wonderland might as well have been about anyone the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult film star in history is almost irrelevant to make matters about a thousand times worse the picture is loaded down with jerkoff gimmicks annoying machine gun editing sloppy dogme camerawork unnecessary split screen graphics and animation etc etc in the absence of a compelling story and unique main character the director and i use the term loosely has thrown together a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a movie among these the trendy bleach bypass look of narc or traffic or minority report the frantic often incomprehensible throw the pieces of film in the air cutting style of natural born killers or days later the fill every moment of silence with an old song to evoke the period soundtrack of goodfellas or blow the groovy retro title sequence of velvet goldmine or autofocus or catch me if you can the list goes on and on and on pathetic i wanted to like this movie i had real hopes for it wonderland avenue had been around for years had the context of the murders been emphasized rather than the murders themselves i think it could have worked had the murders and holmes s growing involvement with seedy l a types signaled the end of a career or the end of the swinging s i think the film could have had meaning it could have served a purpose as it is meaningless pointless who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown by the public the case isn t famous enough to merit such painstaking examination this film should have been the third act of the john holmes story that s it period and it could have worked what s that oh right right they didn t want to tell a traditional rise and fall story they didn t want to make boogie nights or goodfellas or star or autofocus they wanted their film to be different right well in one sense they succeeded there s a big difference between those films and wonderland the difference is those films are good 
i was excited when i heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie the whole era s southern california and subject matter drug and porn industry is intriguing to me i thought this would be a sure fire hit i was not thrilled with the choice of kilmer as holmes they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms i guess he sells tickets however i was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot i was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do i will admit that there were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act john holmes was there but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family and self if he talked to police about it in fact holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved so this was still really one big mystery a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on the person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead however there is no real storyline it is fragmented claptrap the script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting the film gives no insight into holmes or the other people involved kilmer s character disappears for long stretches his girlfriend is dull the police are jokes even kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial it is a very shallow piece and dare i say boring the director even tries to turn it into a love story which is nice unless you know anything about what a piece of trash john holmes really was perhaps a couple of viewings of anderson s boogie nights might have helped here boogie nights was innovative and exciting in all regards this film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style even the music is out of place with duran duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in then we have gordon lightfoot gordon lightfoot there could have been a great film based on this gruesome event but i have not seen it yet i have not seen even a decent one yet unless you consider the rahad jackson scene from boogie nights 
anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series the borg does not come around until q brings the enterprise to the gamma sector the klingons are never seen until kirk encounters them the ncc was the first ship to carry the enterprise name need i go on berman and pilliar have made a mockery of gene roddenberry s creation after he died they only saw and just went their own way no wonder majel barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series i don t blame her for not being involved with this mess poor bakula he s a great actor as are the entire cast i like them all but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series just check the ratings i think more people watched deep space which was untimely canceled 
takashi shimizu had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film ju on the grudge while i haven t seen that film i would have to wager that there s more imagination and originality or some rip off originality in other words skill with known tropes of the japanese ghost movie than in his own directed remake maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal or i would guess accessibility for an american audience what starts off with some potential the hint of something very screwed up going on with bill pullman s sudden movement just goes into a total jumble and as a horror movie gimme a break tension could have been built on the situation a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel scares how s about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something a black cat yeah why not just make the ghost boy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which in effect is only creepy if you want cats plot why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told meaning while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall they aren t or for that matter have us care about anyone in the cast by the time the characters or those that are there for exposition get around to telling us what is going on or whatever there s little point to care the film making is shoddy i e the degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked gellar especially is disappointing but pullman who shows up later after his first scene is sorely miscast even when shimizu tries for some average old boo scares like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the grudge ghost it s still silly just watch when she s going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots either you ll go with it and if so more power to you or you ll laugh hysterically at the results count me in the latter i m not totally sure where this project went wrong was it shimizu having to retool it for the studios or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision or maybe raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing and or dull than they would be with someone else the grudge gives us a lot of information that doesn t make sense or at the least give us some horror fodder to chew on it s cineplex trash of a sad order 
all the kids aged from want to see this movie although you are only allowed at they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it i feel very sad kids can t see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is this was one of the worst movies i saw in months every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie and the end it s an open ending why because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story this movie is just made to make you scared and if you are a bit smart and know some about music you exactly know when you ll be scared when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told a bit to loud him that this was a total waste of money some stupid kid looked strange at me these day i could make an oscar with a home video of my goldfish if only i use the right marketing 
despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential set as a prequel to the original star trek series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer rick berman who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a star trek series could be which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint the actual show runner brannon braga didn t help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise s internal mythology it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck never have i seen a series that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors jolene blaylock excepted last so long it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience even a trekker audience is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that enterprise suffered from franchise fatigue and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they the audience will come simply put in a teevee universe where we are given shows like battlestar galactica and the shield the powers that be must give the viewing public a star trek that measures up and is dramatically competitive it is just that straightforward and easy 
this movie may seem scary on commercials but the actual movie was a reason to vomit this is a below below average even lower than that and has no plot i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you but so what make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair dead japanese woman can you say horrible rip off of samara the ring don t get me started with the dead child not even that scary so what he has a cat and he can imitate it big freaking deal just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge yuck 
i hate to throw out lines like this but in this case i feel like i have to the american remake of the grudge is by far the worst film i have seen in theaters in the last years there i said it and now that i have gotten that out of my system please let me explain why when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born the curse gathers in that place of death those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury that is the premise of the grudge and i will admit it sounds intriguing unfortunately the filmmakers take it no further those who encounter the curse are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get you want more well too bad some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of the grudge is to scare you the problem is that when there is no plot to speak of creepy images and sounds can only go so far director takashi shimizu pulling a george sluizer and remaking his own original film s valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over it pretty much unfolds like this person walks into house something flashes by the camera and or a strange sound is heard person goes to investigate sound starts to get loud person sees a ghost loud scream and or cat screech cut to black before the audience is even given a hint of plot this exact same scenario unfolds times in the first hour the first time was actually somewhat creepy each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on by the time the end of the film rolled around my friend and i were laughingly wondering if this scene would end with a loud scream and a cut to black we were never proved wrong the film has no liner storyline instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled i have no problem with non linear storytelling when it is done right the film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason i haven t seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of highlander and this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had if you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic and why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone obviously greenlit the second the american version of the ring made million its first weekend the grudge is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie the scariest things about the grudge are that it made million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the scariest movie ever made i wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see the grudge 
i am a great fan of david lynch and have everything that he s made on dvd except for hotel room the hour twin peaks movie so when i found out about this i immediately grabbed it and and what is this it s a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny maybe i don t know what s good but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of david lynch to make a few bucks too let me make it clear that i didn t care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have all in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity i highly recommend you don t spend your money on this out of 
i m somewhat of a fan of lynche s work so i was excited when i found this dvd unfortunately i was very let down it s a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor the animation is very crude no doubt done using macromedia each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows for people who are not familiar with this vein of animation they will probably be somewhat impressed by it however if you ve spent much time on newgrounds com like me then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you ve seen before many of the popular amateur artists on newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd if lynch submitted this work to the website then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of newgrounds artists but since i saw this on dvd instead of on newgrounds i give it a instead of a as i would have otherwise these cartoons are fit for the internet but with a name like david lynch on it i expected better quality both in story and in animation 
david lynch s crude and crudely drawn take on south park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clich s about suburban middle class families the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises the son and mother are permanently horrified incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series lynch is not famous for his comedies i e on the air aspects of wild at heart and i am not particularly fond of comedies in general however there were a couple of scenes in dumbland which made me laugh out loud there are some clever bits of animated cinematography where lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions which never really vary in dumbland i believe lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight forward if disturbing animated comedy here interestingly he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra low brow humor i e most will farrell films while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross out humor while the blend doesn t really work very well here it is nothing if not lynchian worth seeing by lynch fans 
let s be honest here the only reason anyone bought this the only reason anyone reviewed this and the only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because david lynch made it and because you want to have david lynch s children but guess what even david lynch can produce a piece of crap maybe lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience absurdity in itself as a pure subject of knowing maybe the atrocious cacophonist sounds and chicken scratch visuals are supposed to imply something about humanity s place in the world about our relation to the real about the absurdity of it all instead it just says one thing to me i just lost if i wanted offensive for the sake of offensive i could crank hansen on high and let me ears bleed if i wanted absurd for the sake of absurd i could just take a dump on a plate and watch that for minutes there is a single redeeming quality to dumbland it is meta meta funny that is it is so bad that it isn t even funny because it s so bad this fact however is a little funny if you hate yourself and hate your money then buy dumbland if not spare yourself the agony 
you wouldn t expect a movie like this to be good and it isn t it s a no budget ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand held camera and it s hilarious the actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings there is no plot to be seen the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families the gore effects are actually some of the most sickening i ve ever seen it seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs it s a funny and sickening film and it s about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie my rating bomb mins 
a terrible amateur movie director no not todd sheets his new friend and sister explore a cave the friend and sister fall in and get rescued meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their turf whatever the heck that means this film and i use the term very loosely is so bad that it s well bad the humor is painfully unfunny the action merely sad now i ve seen some atrociously awful horror films in my time failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low budget films yet i still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this only for the most hardened maschocists amongst you but the rest run away fast my grade f
and a budget and this movie still looks like it was made for you can tell from the first frame to the last that he didn t care one bit about the movies continuity or plot he was just happy to be making a zombie movie what the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies it could have been great if he just had of given a care the end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore and even more poorly produced metal plays over it what happens when you combine high hopes big dreams a decent budget hard work and one idiot behind the camera 
ok i really don t have too much to say about this film other than this i have seen over films in my life and more than of those were horror films while i have some difficulty deciding which is the best as opposed to my favourite which i can tell you is george a romero s dawn of the dead i can tell you without the slightest hesitation that todd sheets zombie bloodbath is the absolute worst horror film i have ever seen there is simply nothing positive i can say about this film the acting the dialogue the directing the make up the music every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even released even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist please heed my warning and do not waste your time on this garbage there is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this you won t even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display trust me please 
if you haven t seen zombie bloodbath you haven t a contest like make your own horror movie in one day could not possibly come up with a entry than this outrage of an insult on any viewer s intelligence mr sheets forgot a story a plot proper dialog the fact that people need some basic acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously forgot to show up it seems to be recorded on the crummiest of handycams and copied on even worse equipment make up effect consist of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt being poured over people s heads in order to simulate their skin melting this is nothing more than a home movie and a really bad one as well only fun to watch for the friends familymembers and neighbours that were willing to show up for the filming i cannot for the life of me understand why this mockery of a product is listed in any serious film magazine or website i have home movies of wedding parties that are way better and more interesting a total waste of time money and energy the sequel zombie bloodbath ii is just more of the same rubbish 
while it contains facts that are not widely reported it is not exactly the truth they took a lot of liberties in rearranging events excluding people and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the s there were more than just bonnie clyde and w d in the gang at various times and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included buck and blanche went to convince clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout and in fact got drawn back into crime some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night bonnie s wound was much more severe and never healed right it was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe i know i m being nit picky and it was a tv movie but even without these factual errors in this true story the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives rather than being a cohesive flowing story i d recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth 
i thought hedy burress who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one was going to be in part guess not i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the th part you know what i mean this movie like scream and urban legend followed movies within a movie this was pure crap the whole movie within a movie crap bad stay away 
a meteor hit s crater lake hence our title awakening a plesiosaur who proceed s to snack on the hick population in california that hick capital of the world there s bad movies and then there s the crater lake monster which somehow managed to escape mst k featuring grating acting a decent stop motion beast and more this is a dreadful piece of s low budget exploitation monster movie dreck while the movie is guilty of many crimes the biggest one is arnie and mitch two obnoxious rednecks who serve as our comic relief they bumble around fight to stock banjo music ogle women and act like pathetic excuses of humanity the characters are so bad they should count as a crime against humanity 
man what a scam this turned out to be not because it wasn t any good as i wasn t really expecting anything from it but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its stars as being stuart whitman stella stevens and tony bill sure enough their names did not appear in the film s opening credits much less themselves in the rest of it as it turned out the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybody s guess even so since i paid for its rental and i was in a monster movie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup it stunk apart from the fact that it had a no name cast and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jaws like pretensions and intentionally so at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts cum boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on the creature itself a plesiosaur i e half dinosaur half fish is imperfectly realized naturally but as had been the case with the giant claw which i ve also just seen this didn t seem to bother the film makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can especially during the movie s second half 
well what are the odds at the exact right moment that a few redneck amateur scientists discover cave paintings indicating that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabited the area thousands of years ago a burning meteor crashes into the lake and spontaneously hatches a monster s egg that has been lying there for over a thousand years i suppose the crater lake monster is a movie that literally must be seen to be believed but you better do so in the company of many friends and a pile of ganja in order to make the wholesome a little bit easier to digest yes this is a terrible film with the utmost ramshackle screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding interludes that are downright embarrassing but it s also irresistibly charming and so clumsily put together that you simply have to cherish some kind of fondness for it half of the film at least revolves on the wacky adventures of arnie and mitch these two local yokels own and run a boat renting shop near the lake but spend most of their days picking their noses and quarreling over fascinating stuff like to spell the word bait it is mostly during their prototypic laurel hardy situations that new puddles of blood or decapitated heads are discovered in the lake steve hanson the heroic but not exactly sharp sheriff is on the case but only if he s not too busy chasing big city thugs traveling through the area halfway through the film there suddenly is an abrupt scene about a thug robbing a liquor store and killing two people in the process this textbook wtf moment appears to take on the complete other side of the country like in new york city or something and has absolutely nothing to do with the events going on at crater lake only like twenty minutes later the robber pops up again in hicksville and there s an exhilarating chase through the woods ending in the dino s hungry muzzle the absurd little details in the crater lake monster are too numerous to mention for example this is probably the only creature feature in which the players discover the obligatory gigantic footprint after they already spotted the actual monster the goofs in continuity should be legendary as far as i m concerned it s like everybody forgot to pay attention to it night turns into twilight into day and back into twilight all during one and the same diurnal course the monster is undeniably the best aspect about the film especially since it s accomplished through good old fashioned and adorable stop motion effects the cute critter is a plesiosaur meaning an aquatic dinosaur looking like a crossbreed between denver the last dinosaur and an alligator crater lake monster is a unique and unforgettable movie experience that i can only encourage to track down the miserable out of rating is just out of principle and because basically this is a very bad film should be put into perspective because i might as well could have given it out of for sheer entertainment value 
 and how they bore you right out of your mind the crater lake monster is one of the classic bad films from the s made with no actors of any note an embarrassing script woeful direction and a tireless desire to fuse horror with light comedy this movie introduces a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur underneath crater lake a meteor falls from the sky and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding crater lake the whole matter is taken care of by steve our local sheriff much of the film when not showing pools of blood left behind from what we imagine must have been the beast dining is spent following the bumbling antic of two guys named arnie and mitch who run a boat rental place they try so bad to be funny that we get lines like looking at a business sign mitch saying to arnie you spelled bait wrong it s spelled b a t e the laughs were rather scarce here we then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree trunk to be the dinosaur laurel and hardy watch out the dinosaur looks fake but the movie is fun in a bad way and at the very least the lake is beautiful 
return to cabin by the lake does not in any way stand up to the original with only one main character stanley returning for the sequal the film is not even worth the hours of your time i am a huge fan of the first film the story line and acting was really good but this is one movie that i will never again watch it is basically equal to what the sequals to urban legends and blair witch were like but with much worse acting i ve personally seen better acting in soap operas it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh i in no way recommend this movie to anyone watching it will just detract from the first 
firstly i would like to point out that i only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it i find it the most annoying program on tv there is nothing funny about any of the jokes and the canned laughter is unbearable the show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience that way the laughter would show just how unfunny the show is however i give credit to the acting talents of the young cast it sickens me however to think that they ll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first tv show was the show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the cbbc presenters why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me that is all 
stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack and soon enough ollie cracks with all the horn noises he is resting at home with stan by his side needing quiet and the doctor james finlayson phones to say he is coming over to check on ollie after realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross eyed repairman the doctor comes in for a check up and after some tests he recommends drinking goat s milk and getting some sea air on the ocean after stan practises some trumpet playing hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash he and ollie to a dock to rent a boat they keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat and stan has brought his trumpet meanwhile the newspaper s front page reads that killer nick grainger escaped convict richard cramer has escaped and he sneaks onto the boys boat while they are sleeping and the goat chews through the boat rope drifting out to sea in the morning the see their location and the killer comes out demanding something to eat and he spots stan and ollie making fake food e g string for spaghetti soap for cheese belt for bacon sponge for meatballs and he forces them to eat it when ollie starts choking on something stan blows his trumpet to help and ollie s rage gets him punching the killer and it keeps going till the police arrive only to have ollie s rage get them put in prison too there were the tiniest moments of comedy but it isn t a great black and white film well here s another nice mess you ve gotten me into was number on years quotes and stan laurel and oliver hardy were number on the comedians comedian okay 
saps at sea aspect ratio sound format mono black and white suffering from hornophobia ollie embarks on a restful boat trip but he and stan get mixed up with an escaped convict rychard cramer chaos ensues this feature length comedy an ok entry which nonetheless unspools like a mere imitation of laurel and hardy s best work marked the final collaboration between l h and producer hal roach episodic in structure the movie culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after the boys are taken hostage by villainous cramer who shoots a seagull to prove how tough he is the gags are ok but inspiration is lacking perhaps due to the recruitment of actor turned director gordon douglas previously responsible for ollie s first solo effort in the sound era zenobia produced in but whose work here lacks a measure of pzazz fair but nothing special l h regulars charlie hall and james finlayson make guest appearances 
i get the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful ridiculous western ever made painful is the best word i can think of to describe it on the plus side you have nice color photography and beautiful and well spoken rhonda fleming my sympathy goes to jacques aubuchon who played the cripple who acted well enough in an annoying role written so atrociously that no actor could give an enjoyable performance the production values were quite good which only served to highlight the terrible story and screenplay things i hated stewart granger looked so little like a western figure what with his british accent neat tailored outfit and silly immaculate always white kerchief tied around his neck it got tiresome the way the townspeople and his son were constantly haranguing and insulting granger and he never spoke up or replied back i know we are supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate westerns as symbolic morality plays but this one broke the spell with it laughably unrealistic and predictable scenes the worst being at the end where granger miraculously speedily and single handedly plants dynamite around a canyon pass that the bad guy s cattle will pass through and then granger plants himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create rock slides to bury and spook the cattle and bad guys seemingly destroying them all save the two main bad guys next worst is everything about the plot which is loaded with soap opera scenes nothing in the movie seemed believable i couldn t believe what all the conflict was about the bad guy was driving his herd through to market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way i don t see why something couldn t have been worked out you need a land ownership dispute for that don t bother to see it 
let me start out by saying that i used to really like betty grable particularly from down argentine way but by the time she got around to this disaster she had also got round and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment costarred with douglas fairbanks jnr who must have been fairly desperate the story was bad the colours good and the film far too long it had some of the old standbys in it like harry davenport and reginald gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success the music score was woeful and i have to say not one tune was memorable in any way as i was such a fan of miss grable i always wish i had never seen this one 
the final film for ernst lubitsch completed by otto preminger after lubitsch s untimely death during production is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness romance and music fantasy and costume dramatics in a th century castle in southeastern europe a countess falls for her sworn enemy the leader of the hungarian revolt she s aided by her ancestor whose painted image magically comes to life betty grable in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers has never been more beautiful and her songs are very pleasant unfortunately this script by samson raphaelson taken from an operetta by rudolf schanzer and e welisch is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh or entertain the results are good looking but unabsorbing from 
watching that lady in ermine i was wondering what betty grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for marlene dietrich to do someone over at th century fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another darryl f zanuck should have known better betty plays a th century italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of hungarian hussars captained by douglas fairbanks jr her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree sees no small resemblance in doug now and another invader some years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed besides that the current betty has just been married to cesar romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment before things have been consummated that s going to give anyone a bad attitude i guarantee fresh wholesome all american betty is not the actress to do seductive and mysterious marlene dietrich might have put this over but with betty it falls flatter than yesterday s presidential candidate she and fairbanks have no chemistry at all though doug is as charming as ever and someone i can watch in anything frederick hollander and leo robin wrote the score for this film and this is the moment got an oscar nomination for best song that lady in ermine s one chance for oscar glory fell to buttons and bows ernest lubitsch died midway during the film and otto preminger finished that lady in ermine i can t believe lubitsch had grable in mind for the lead here neither will you if you see that lady in ermine 
a decent sequel but does not pack the punch of the original a murderous screenwriter judd nelson assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel cabin by the lake still ruthless killing but movie seems very tongue in cheek any humor is not of the funny kind total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times nelson is way over the top this movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen this should have happened to this script 
well maybe i m just having a bad run with hindi movies lately i asked the video store guy for apharan prakash jha but being a new release wasn t available yet so i had to settle for this one it turned out to be the stupidest hindi movie i ve seen and i ve seen quite a few no wonder bollywood is the laughing stock of the whole world if imdb had negative ratings i would give garam masala a i remember seeing a tv show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in mumbai all the usual celebs and their sideys showed up for some strange reason people expect good stuff from piyadarashan i did not like hulchul hungama or his other films hulchul probably dubbed from tamil or telugu came across as very loud in your face fare that again didn t make much sense except in a bollywood flick this latest piece of utter cxxp proved that this guy has no brains who made him a director even a bollywood director at that anyhow to the film now what starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non sensical woman hunt two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment isn t it similar to no entry where the dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office jezuz christ now they re copying their own stories well anyways there s some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi lateral love aka multi tasking multi timing what happened in the end i ve no idea i switched off mid way what ridiculous junk i can t believe they even released it and how sadistic to wallow in their own filth for which audience did they make it the poor illiterate indian masses mil at last count or the well heeled nri desis staying in phoren either ways it doesn t matter neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god awful stuff its a short review because there s nothing to write about but the usual bag of f grade garbage bollywood should change its name to follywood and yes this review is much better than the movie itself 
it begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectations mac akshay kumar and sam s john abraham characters are not properly built before mac s boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess rest of the drama is about how mac sam and uncle mambo paresh rawal deal with situations which at times seem forced about the cast paresh rawal is a very talented actor i thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook akshay kumar is tolerable john abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture rajpal yadav is the only saving grace in the movie the second half of the movie is funny at times but in all a dud songs are boring and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy 
do not waste your time with this movie this is a total thrash in terms of acting directing sound editing soundtrack there was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors the movie does not do justice to paresh rawal who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in bollywood akshay kumar who is also an emerging star did quite a poor job john abraham what is wrong with him is that what you call acting i mean he should thank god that he has a pretty face otherwise he d be winning razzie awards in india if there were any such awards in bollywood asrani a great talent but overdoes his bit as before screenplay which was not to mention a rip off from the s boeing boeing was quite badly framed first of all people in bollywood just can t make something original on top of that they don t even know how to copy well the jokes in the movie were so overdone it was getting painful to sit through them priyadarshan may be a star in the south but he s just not fit to make a decent hindi movie the sound editing is amazingly crappy i can go on and on this matter but the bottom line is that bollywood should be shameful of making such a film the worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie what is wrong with you guys this is the reason why bollywood is where it is did you know that bollywood makes more movies than hollywood every year however most of the movies are unheard of abroad because of movies like this one i am an indian and i am utterly shameful of bollywood for producing this piece of thrash movies like dil chahta hai and lagaan were just terrific they are world class films which are timeless among the best of this decade garam masala however is perhaps one of the worst of this century period i give it a out of 
i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences i think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and david dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences so it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction give us more of herapheri s and malamal weekly s rather than giving duds like garam masala 
watched on hulu far too many commercials so it broke the pacing but even still it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties dean martin and jerry lewis where both parts are played by jerry lewis if i were indian i d protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews they cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them i usually enjoy indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment especially for a modern indian film the story doesn t take place in india the uncle keeps referring to when mac will return to india but i can t find out where it is supposed to be happening 
i never understood why some people dislike bollywood films they ve got charismatic actors great dance numbers and heightened emotion what s not to like what i didn t realize was that i had only seen the upper crust of bollywood then i watched garam masala i could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie i was going to like the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening serendipitously on a series of photo setups populated with gyrating models but i kept hoping things would improve sadly they didn t the main problem is that the two protagonists mac sam are completely unsympathetic they spend the entire movie lying to women and lying brutally in order to get them into bed and the audience is supposed to find this funny and be charmed the boys are unscrupulous and inept and not in a lovable way mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating the script is extremely poor with repetitive scenes setups that never lead to anything and illogical actions and statements by the characters in fact the characters are never really developed at all the males are boorish greedy jerks and the women merely interchangeably beautiful if you go by this movie you would think that air hostesses are pretty easy to pass from man to man in reality betrayal is not so humorous the only bright spots i found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets and a few slapsticky moments involving the french farce door slamming aspects of the story but bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by farah khan and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of buster keaton and harold lloyd who seem to have influenced writer director priyadarshan not a little priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the play boeing boeing the original author of that work marc camoletti is credited nowhere at least priyadarshan changed the title for this remake rather than brazenly using the original without giving credit as he did in his version of this same tale according to imdb s credits list 
dietrich bonhoeffer s writings have had a profound influence on my life as a christian and i eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life words can hardly express my disappointment this movie was disjointed it gave no background about his life no historical context and nothing about his great writings except a brief passing reference to the cost of discipleship by a colleague at the beginning of the movie instead we see him enjoying jazz apparently in the states and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to germany apparently to show his human side ok i m ready for the dramatic part the part where he stands up for his faith instead of emphasizing that we get a very badly acted romance with a year old schoolgirl whether or not that actually took place it should not have been a major portion of the movie now still waiting for the dramatic part or some narration explaining what his writings were all about or something to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man drum roll waiting waiting zip nada this is the kind of movie that gives christian films a bad name all they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow with some background even some voice overs or flashbacks to him preaching from his works some narrative about who he was and where he had been but no this is what we got hardly fitting for a hero of the faith 
this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast another problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and first ends up with fairly demeaning work the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these i e they are all firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much deja vu and too few surprises 
on the back burner for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly and went straight downhill from there mary richards mary tyler moore and her best friend rhoda morgenstern valerie harper meet in new york after a long estrangement and catch up on each other s lives what a novel concept but sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years so instead the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner the supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone moore allegedly stalled this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself if this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like it s not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work at one time this was intended as a pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors or for that matter among potential audiences quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic 
if you haven t seen this yet i say just move on take a walk in the park don t waste your time neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money spoilers i can t decide which was worse the movie itself or baldwin s hairstyle ellen pompeo s acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time the storyline is just unbelievable loose cannon american cop fighting criminals in europe on his own infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers give me a break there s only one good thing about this movie though at least the production costs must be lower than ocean s s which was as meaningless and over the top as this one 
this effort was like a glitzy tv movie i don t recall this ever being released in theaters if so it must ve died a quick death watching the dvd in the comfort of our bedroom it was obvious this film was meant for not much more ed lauter an art critic with a greed streak what a fun turn that must ve been i haven t seen ed since the longest yard everyone else pretty much acted by the numbers led by baldwin except for pompeo she had zero charisma and seemed to be sleepwalking thru most of the picture pompeo s daughter had one dimension she played every scene like a lovable little puppy slowest line delivery of any year old i ve seen yet the chase scenes gave my wife and i headaches too much quick cutting and angle bashing if you re going to shoot a chase scene in barcelona you might want a few wide shots to exploit the beauty of your backdrop right the whole story was pretty implausible and far fetched but hey we liked it better than the life aquatic 
i watched cabin by the lake this afternoon on usa considering this movie was made for tv is was interesting enough to watch the sequel so i tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed i knew i wouldn t like the movie but i was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of dv digital video the movie would have been tolerable if it wasn t for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere i expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots but there seemed to be no logical explanation warning the following maybe a spoiler the open ending in cabin by the lake was acceptable but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous i can only foresee return of return to the cabin by the lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing but infomercials at o clock in the morning 
first i realize that a rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst this movie gets that from me because as one reviewer points out it s not bad in a self aware over the top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value it simply misses its mark on every count contains possible spoilers the dialog is completely disingenuous the continuity is so deliberate it s painful daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love and with his final word the flamenco dancers start the mock shock of what s her name see i don t even remember her character s name let alone the name of the forgettable actress when her husband the baldwin first tells her that her friend is the bad guy the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things vegetable carts gone flying cars crashing into each other motorcycles going down the stairs people nearly being hit but remarkably no one is oh that s right except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds and an approaching car apparently didn t notice him there hmmm it s becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money you d think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing now there s a novel idea my suggestion don t see this film don t rent the dvd don t watch it on cable there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied 
this film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past let the future viewer be forewarned that art heist doesn t add anything to the genre director bryan goeres has no clue what to do with the film william baldwin keeps reappearing in films and frankly one wonders if he has a great agent or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies the only good movie in which he has appeared is the squid and the whale in which he only speaks two or three lines ellen pompeo his leading lady doesn t fare much better there is no chemistry between ms pompeo and mr baldwin a movie to be seen at the viewer s own risk 
although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments i find that the plot and idea are very good many of the supporting actors were very good the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo i am sure i have never seen a less talented actor how this person has ever been in a film or on television i cannot imagine in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a wal mart to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles does beg the question who does she know i would very much like to see this film re made with some talent i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it 
one may ask why the characters snarl yell and chew the scenery without any perceptible reason except someone wanted to make a movie in barcelona billie baldwin is that the right one is forgettable in the cop estranged husband loving father of cute little blond girl role the story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years ellen pompeo s lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in her true acting range is displayed when she takes her blouse off as the movies careens from one limp chase scene to another unfortunately the directing rarely goes bad enough to be camp or a parody it is all just clich familiar in every respect the director cast his own daughter as the precocious brat probably because no respectable agent would have permitted a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame contrived and uninteresting movie the only heist here is the theft of the investor s money and the viewer s time 
 i saw this on the sci fi channel it came on right after the first one for some reason this movie kept me interested i don t know why stop asking spoilers okay it was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie in the first movie he had a reason to kill people but in this sequal half of the killings attempted killings were basicly for no reason stanley killed the director due to creative differences he captured the co writer due to creative differences but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast no cast no movie he wanted it to look real when they died if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie use the special effects man of course like the first one the captured girl gets away and stanley ends up getting messed up and dissapears woooooow sarcasm this movie had potential and the saddest thing of all the really sad part i would watch a cabin by the lake only because i like judd nelson and he s the only good part about this sequal 
my wife and i both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made certainly in the top ten of those i ve watched all the way through at least plan was enjoyable i did really enjoy christine the dead zone firestarter carrie and some of his other films i didn t care much for cujo only because the sound was so bad on versions i ve seen and i often couldn t tell what people were saying or pet sematary pet cemetery but this mess was a total mistake in every way possible the creatures themselves seemed designed by a year old no offense to year olds even the one liners made us groan and weren t remotely amusing 
 sleepwalkers is the first film which stephen king has written a script for given this and the excellent santo johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie you would be expecting a odd and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience unfortunately that s not what you d be getting the thing is they could have probably made it a good movie the beginning is intriguing what with it s small town spooky atmosphere but something strange happens about minutes into the film the film turns funny for no apparent reason from that moment on the whole atmosphere of sleepwalkers is ruined for those of you who have seen it who can ever forget good old johnny screaming out cop kabob after jabbing the pencil into that one cop s ear but don t get me wrong the humor has no redeemiing quality i just rented it again to see if mabye i was wrong the first time around given how original the plot sounded but i was right man what a waste i can t believe they got the rights to that santo johnny song i gave this a 
this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made true most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible there is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary it is typical king garbage myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place mixed with obvious and belabored so called scares that are about as shocking as peewee s playhouse which at least is entertaining it is full of ridiculous moments not the least of which is alice krige s character when she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old batman tv show it is so absurd as to be sickening all the people who had cameos in this including john landis are lucky they still have careers but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at k mart the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out act the people in the movie 
i have nothing against a fast paced fright flick but this stephen king derived nonsense is too freshly scrubbed too bright and modern the plot about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a sleepwalker sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf and who feeds on the blood of female virgins begs for a more mysterious ambiguous treatment this thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel with hardly any atmosphere the kids are predictably pretty and energetic but the big plus is alice kridge as the boy s mother kridge from ghost story never broke out of the filler female mold and it s a huge loss that she hasn t been used more her performance is creepy and intense and gives hint that sleepwalkers might ve been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction it s too over the top and commercially driven with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama stephen king pops up in a cameo as do real life directors john landis and tobe hooper from 
it could have been a marvelous story based on the ancient races of cat people but it wasn t this work could have been just that marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled the lead characters charles brady played by brian krause and his mother mary played by alice krige were shallowly done had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing not even m dchen amick who played tanya robertson s character fit into that description however as i ve said many times before when you adapt a stephen king novel for tv you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren t written for tv and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist this is another botched attempt to take the magick of stephen king writing whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay to simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen his novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie nothing less but certainly nothing more his screenplays are hit and miss unfortunately this screenplay translation was a miss sorry sorry sorry movie this movie gets a from the fiend 
a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them that about sums it up i ll admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay not that i have anything specific against mr king are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work makeup and quite suitable music the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady the otherworldly mother king manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little different okay a lot in this case trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan 
there are no spoilers here because there is no plot to spoil madchen amick is living proof a face can make a living acting no talent required the only bright spot are a few really good one liners delivered very nicely by alice krige but then again she is alice krige her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be she is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot how they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery the screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script it has major continuity problems superficial stereotypical characters horror formula writing and simply falls short of making any sense what so ever the creatures while they have neat skills like going dim the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored don t waste any time on this one 
ok i taped this off tv and missed the very start the film was about or so seconds into the titles i assume so if anything happened before that i missed it lots of people say mark hammill is in this i didn t see him i did recognise clive barker john landis and obviously stephen king doing some really awful acting as the graveyard attendant alice krige looks lovely apart from the scenes where she has the cat face or is in full alien make up even with the opening titles it s never really explained very well exactly what sleepwalkers are or where they come from from the title sequence i assume they are catlike bipeds who live by extracting life force from humans i assume they live a long time and these particular are possibly the last of their kind add to this a very large dose of incest yes i thought it was a bit suspect too shapeshifting killer cats and invisibility and you have sleepwalkers it s a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the main characters and far too many cameo s to try and distract from the simple fact that not enough is explained to the viewer avoid 
 and after seeing this pile of crap you won t be surprised that it wasn t published spoilers this is a terrible movie by any standards but when i point out that it s one of the worst movies that has the name stephen king in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is the movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror my god what happened here i don t know but they sure hate cats the camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated boy this guy is right someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman oh wait a minute he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you re going to be watching a bad movie the reason sleepwalkers is bad is that it s very illogical and confused we eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an american coastal town having said that at least we know of the monsters motives that s the only thing we learn we never learn how they re able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from the terminator monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible the demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats if they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden there was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them i guess that s so the production team can come up with an ending it was that they started the movie my complaint lies we re treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like john landis clive barker and even stephen king make cameos i think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what they weren t going to appear in a movie this bad so stephen king had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast that s how bad sleepwalkers is unbelievable as it seems that wasn t the worst line in the movie the worst line is that cat saved my life 
giving credit where it s due only the technicolor costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention this is undoubtedly the lowest point in bing crosby s long career at paramount the script is about as clumsy as you could possibly imagine and neither the casual bing nor william bendix nor sir cedric hardwicke can do a thing about repairing it bendix looks extremely foolish in a page boy wig and poor rhonda fleming has a stock costume heroine role requiring her to look adoringly at bing and little else except for warbling a couple of uninspired ballads in a voice probably dubbed for the occasion just plain awful mark twain s wit is not evident in any of the screenplay only die hard crosby fans can possibly appreciate this mess of a film given uninspired direction even the extras look as though they don t know what they re supposed to be doing summing up dull as dishwater not recommended even for children 
what s with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie it s like someone put muddy water on the camera lens the violence and nudity might turn some people off but that along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie i suppose my favorite line is delivered by tarquin the vampire alas your breed is dumb okay no one should ever say alas in a movie line unless they re english and living in the th century the acting by the van helsing character and bad girl rally isn t bad i also liked master little played by ron little wicked martial arts don t take it too seriously and you ll enjoy it 
an interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus but done several times by now overall the movie is too long and drags a bit the editing could have been tighter i am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits maybe the movie was rushed to market the lighting was too dark in places but the worst technical problem is the audio the level was good enough to hear the dialog but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them which is very distracting either they were not careful in the recording or the sound mixing could have been better also too much background noise got through the should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes the tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter also the acting was a bit flat i am sorry but when i see that the same person writes and stars in a movie in my experience it is a red flag but it was a good effort so i gave it a 
how can a movie have ozzy osbourne and still suck i just don t get it trick or treat managed to do it this sucks and likes it trick or treat is one of those movies i have to warn people about it is a vomit inducing vile atrocity just begging to be viewed so you can feel that much worse about yourself trick or treat has no redeeming factors for a movie about heavy metal it sure doesn t seem to grasp what heavy metal is or what it represents this movie manages to make heavy metal look lame and this was in probably one of heavy metal s strongest hours that is quite a feat however negative trick or treat so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it that simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and gutless film 
nine minutes of psychedelic pulsating often symmetric abstract images are enough to drive anyone crazy i did spot a full frame eye at the start and later some birds silhouetted against other colors it was just not my cup of tea it s about minutes too long 
this movie does not rock as others have said i found it really boring and silly the story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer the singer dies but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at of course midnight on halloween which would actually make it november st a much less potent date to be sure the kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back play messages it also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world the first part of this film is not a horror film at all but rather an after school special we see the metal kid the outsider tormented over and over by the popular kids and he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies when the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party don t go it is a trap especially if it is a pool party anybody surprised when he ends up in the water it was such an after school special that i kept waiting for melissa sue anderson to show up and teach jody foster a lesson so back to the horror part of the film so this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys which would have made much more sense he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm what a sensitive hero what fun is that in a horror movie thank goodness carrie white did not follow this lesson he actually tries to prevent having the music played at the halloween dance the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him if it were me i would have put that music on and pronto the rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized why not partner with him and really do some damage why you ask it seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt more appropriate for a molly ringwald film is this a horror film or an episode of beauty and the beast the movie just goes on and on at this point with no scares horror or anything worth watching if you went to high school in the late s like i did this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair but that is it for this film skip it and stay home and just listen to some kiss 
a bad one oh my this is one of the movies which doesn t have even one positive effect just everything from actors to story stinks to the sky i just wonder how low i q you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy is there something than this is worth watching for well there is a lot of nudity involved but it s nothing particular and when you just think that it couldn t get worse your realize that all the naked ladies looked like there are forty years old c mon guys where did you search for these actresses in elderly home perhaps anyway the leading actresses has some sex appeal and knows how to show it again too bad that she is too skinny old all in all skip these one out of
