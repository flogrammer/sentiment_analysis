honestly i am not that impressed by it it s not a bad movie but it s not great one either there s a story to tell but it s told in a very incoherent way which kinds of makes it loose it s full meaning and ability to intrigue this movie could of been made in another way with an outstanding result the story is just so interesting yet somehow i m not intrigued when watching it it definitely isn t an amateur movie rather the opposite and some of the scenes are really emotional the actors and actresses does quite a good job and so does the director but there s just something so unfinished by the whole movie that i cant quite put my finger on perhaps if you had gotten to know the characters abit more all the messiness of the movie could of been better clarified and put more action throughout it cause as it was it became abit slow from time to time 
i am a big fan of this film and found the tv mini series children of the dust the version fans should look for at least minutes or more are cut on the dvd version of this film i would also suggest viewers who enjoyed this film to check out the book there is a more rounded storyline with corby whitewolf and rachel more on black history and buffalo solders there were two many storylines for the series or this film sidney poitier only shows he gets better with age the talent just keeps growing the chemistry between his character of gypsy smith and regina taylor were wonderful viewing i also enjoyed the billy wirth joanna going storyline they seems to play off each other well billy wirth is of course the model of indian vision the look the attitude the dream of every woman who was wanted to be carried off in one of those romance novels by a native hero worked for me also much more could have been done with this storyline but it did give the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems back in the s white take over of native schooling lack of black pioneers to setup towns in the west michael moriarty maxwell as always a great actor comes across as a very caring and confused teacher not sure if the whites should be interfering with native culture for anyone who enjoys characters and watching them change this film is for you i thought the chemistry between poitier s character and that of the orphan whitewolf very moving and thought wirth and poitier worked very well together billy wirth did some of his best scenes when working with poitier going got on my nerves sometimes when you want to just stop and shake her or give her a wake up and grown up call but on the whole it was a great evening of entertainment look for the two tape version of this mini series if you are a fan you will really see the difference 
actor turned director bill paxton follows up his promising debut the gothic horror frailty with this family friendly sports drama about the u s open where a young american caddy rises from his humble background to play against his bristish idol in what was dubbed as the greatest game ever played i m no fan of golf and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen most recently done to grand effect with miracle and cinderella man but some how this film was enthralling all the same the film starts with some creative opening credits imagine a disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of hbo s carnivale and rome but lumbers along slowly for its first by the numbers hour once the action moves to the u s open things pick up very well paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes i loved the rain soaked montage of the action on day two of the open that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings there s some compelling character development when the british harry vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course he also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players heads under pressure golf a painfully boring sport is brought vividly alive here credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period piece atmosphere of london and boston at the beginning of the twentieth century you know how this is going to end not only because it s based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over but paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it despite the formulaic nature this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience 
this movie made me want to bang my head against the wall it is hard to compare such badness as this to anything but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your fingernails and that comment comes from the writer s cousin this movie was so flipping bad it made hulk the second worst movie ever look like the departed one of the greatest movies in cinematic history if you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines then you will absolutely love this movie if you have a brain then you definitely will not when i rented this movie i actually fell asleep while watching it the next day i finished it from where i left off and it was the worst decision of my life 
the concept show families of diverse ethnicities in the fairfax district of l a preparing for the family get together at thanksgiving i loved soul food and how to make an american quilt i think there s a law that alfre woodard has to be in all these movies which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions and was prepared for a treat instead i felt tricked they trot out about characters and all but two are one note cliches with no finesse whatsoever the writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate instead you have a bunch of a holes getting together on turkey day to act like extra obnoxious a holes now to an extent this is what thanksgiving is all about but not this misguidedly and why bother having julianne marguiles then giving her absolutely nothing to do this was a chore to get through and mercedes ruehl is a standout but i give it a 
went with some friends and one of my friends mom thinking it would be a good way to start off the spring break but the movie turned out awful we all agree it shouldn t have been pg more like r material lots of sexual dialog cussing and referring to boy and girl parts below the waist not worth the time or money strongly urge you not to go or rent it when it comes out if you do end up going don t take smaller children not the type of movie to see with the family if curious about the content check out the content advisory section on the superhero movie page on imdb most of the content that was meant to be funny was extremely crude especially when they make fun of steven hawking 
i have read almost all the books by now and have seen the musical production in two different languages i absolutely adored everything that i have been acquainted previously but lately i ve been running out of resources to sustain my fancy i still have couple of books left but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which i am not in a hurry to read so an idea dawned on me sink me there are movies which i have not watched thus i must watch them immediately the first five minutes of these series were acceptable in fact i quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation however different it had seemed it went all downhill from there though chauvelin was too foppish and i daresay too old for this role not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful either or and what was that with random bed scene featuring him it was way too creepy wasn t his only love the madame guillotine and his only interest his job and his only obsession sir percy marguerite prettiest woman in france cleverest woman in europe i think not although whatever compelled her to break into the study of sir percy i haven t the faintest idea and whatever my lord tony has done to deserve this death yes every member of the league did pledge his life to sir percy but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger and if by any means he had to mourn his companion he would have done that mourn not just move on as if nothing had happened which brings me to another point sir percy his portrayal was most dreadful he was neither a lazy fop nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations nor did he care too much about cravats his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed and with his own hands he had never killed anyone so what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering people the costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well this is post revolutionary france we are talking about not pre revolutionary people in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily it was all just gah although i must admit after i watched other parts my opinion did change slightly watching it as a separate work independent of scarlet pimpernel series it was tolerable just your other average hero in the mask but for what they tried to pass it it is still miserable 
the scariest thing about this horror movie is that the end alludes to a sequel the cave is really a disappointing action movie a team of cave and undersea researchers go to romania one of these inexpensive places to make a movie for now at least and following a destroyed church enter in a cave that proves to be a realm of underground monsters or are they daemons the movie never decides if it wants to be action science fiction or horror it is a mix of all without salt or fun and acted in a wooden manner the best thing about the movie is the cinematography but even the dark landscape of the cave becomes soon boring because the film lacks pace and the characters are simply not interesting waste of time 
this is one of the most boring films i ve ever seen the three main cast members just didn t seem to click well giovanni ribisi s character was quite annoying for some reason he seems to like repeating what he says if he was the rain man it would ve been fine but he s not out of 
 may contain spoilers but of course it does not matter battleship potemkin is one stunning spectacle of haunting images the visual direction is well and has been inspiring the sheer scale of the film is impressive and the technique is certainly pioneering what is really amazing is to my mind the depth and effectiveness of a film devoid of proper literary script sound save the soundtrack decent image quality the faux profound self referentialism of today exceptional acting pretense etc what you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered btw the previous poster noted eisenstien felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted the problem is that you think eisenstein is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you it s a little cheap i would ve rather seen a huge final action scene i must warn you that the end is not cheap and eisenstein wasn t being generous to the heroes history however was potemkin really did go through the squadron as it was shown in the film finally i d strongly recommend seeing battleship potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema see it with a fellow movie buff it kept me talking for hours however if you tend to consider films generally accepted as great or classic to be slow or boring this film might not be for you yet not much cheap entertainment here for me though it is a full 
in out was a funny comedy with good performances by joan cusack tom selleck matt dillon and kevin kline the thought of kevin kline being gay was very funny if i was him i would hate to say i m gay at his own wedding with his family friends and his going to be wife there very seldom would that ever happen i also loved when he was dancing around when the voice on the radio was talking to him i d say that in out was a silly comedy with a lot of laughs and giggles this is a recommended comedy and kevin kline had a great performance as a gay guy trust me you ll like this movie 
brain of blood starts as abdul amir reed hadley the leader of a country called kahlid is close to death because of cancer however if he dies kahlid will tear itself apart without anyone to lead them so doctor robert nigserian grant williams one of amir s devotees mohammed zandor vorkov have devised a plan to take amir s dead body to america where mad scientist dr lloyd trenton kent taylor will transplant his brain into a fresh body with a bit of plastic surgery no one will ever know he was even dead things don t go according to plan though as when the time comes to transplant amir s brain trenton s freak assistant gor john bloom brings a dead body of someone that fell from a balcony trenton needed a strong fit living body since there s no more time he decides to use gor s body as a temporary stop gap until another more suitable one can be found unfortunately when amir wakes up in his new body he s not very happy at what he sees i mean would you be if you found out your brain was inside a badly burned freak also known as brain damage the brain the creature s revenege the undying brain this cheapo exploitation flick was produced directed by the one only al adamason quite frankly i m offended at the pathetic rating brain of blood has on the imdb personally i think it s terrific fun in a so bad it s good sort of way the highly entertaining script by kane w lynn joe van rodgers is as loopy silly as they come from sloppy blood soaked brain transplants to crazed mad scientists from foot tall acid scarred freaks who play with toy cars to foot tall midget medical assistant s from basement dungeons to rooftop chases from car crashes to assassination s kidnaps to screaming scantily clad women from regina carrol s hair do which should get it s own mention during the opening credits to teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for blood to a laugh out loud hilarious ending which includes some deep meaningful speech it s all here brain of blood has quality cheese stamped all over it if your a fan of bad low budget exploitation flicks with a sense of fun then this film should be right at the top of your list of must see films despite it s lowly rating i am proud to admit that i liked brain of blood a lot i thought it was an absolute hoot to watch it slows down a bit at the end with a few too many shots of people wandering around doing nothing in particular but until that point it had moved along like a rocket at only minutes it s relatively short it s difficult to second guess the barmy plot i just think it s loads of campy fun this is director adamson s masterpiece as far as i m concerned along with dracula vs frankenstein which he made a year before this those who have seen an adamson film before will know about the none existent production values cheap special effects cardboard sets that all adds to the fun this film manages that fine between incompetence seriousness to create a memorable viewing experience i love the opening shot of kahlid which is obviously just a photo of the taj mahal in india complete with statuesque people in the foreground regina carrol s hair seems to be a separate entity on it s own it seems to change styles between shots is frankly horrendous don t get me started about her make up job either that she must apply with a a paint sprayer there is another hilarious moment when we see amir s body has been transported to america wrapped in what looks like ordinary tin foil why is the question i asked myself why the effects are variable there s a terrible looking fake spider gor s burned make up job is pretty bad although there is a surprisingly gory brain removal which is actually quite impressive the budget for brain of blood must have been practically none existent i must admit i thought trenton s lab was quite good with various computers medical instruments although the rest of the film looks cheap nasty the production values are low the music was taken from another film beast of blood the acting is awful but in a campy fun sort of way brain of blood may have the best title for an exploitation film ever as far as i m concerned it s a highly entertaining piece of nonsense that i had a great time watching laughing at they just don t can t won t make them like this anymore impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good film but bad movie lovers should enjoy it i liked it but then again i m just weird 
yes you can look at babette s feast as some sort of slap at puritanical christianity but it is much more than that the surface story of how a gifted parisian cook flees paris after one of its revolutions by the middle classes and finds herself cast ashore in jutland in the north of denmark is simply the grease that allows the deeper tale to develop babette is an artist one of the small army of people who are driven from pillar to post over the centuries by fatuous politicians vane greedy and arrogant who kill beauty for profit something that politics always does pace national endowment for the arts which simply institutionalizes creativity for propaganda purposes babette is on her last legs as she arrives in the tiny village where two virginal sisters reside seeing over their diminishing flock of devotees to their late pastor father they live on salt cod and black bread gruel babette shows these simple pious people that god is in pleasure and sensuality as well as behavioral and mental purity she also shows them how that mental purity can lead to control freakishness something we all know about in these days of the neo authoritarians in government who would limit our personal freedoms because they are somehow a crime against the state or as they would tell us humanity babette cooks up a bang up french dinner to celebrate the th birthday of the late reverend the daughters and their flock think it is the devil come amongst them and vow not to notice the food or drink it is at this point in the preparing of the meal payed for by babette s winnings in a french lottery that i begin to tear up it is a poignance brought about in comparison to the daily vulgarity and mendacity that floods our consciousness from morning to night via the media and power mongers manoeuvring to gain advantage over all of us out here in the dark the simple sophistication of babette s art spits in the face of all the pretentiousness on display in our modern society and it hurts to watch it played out so exquisitely in this splendid film it is along with fanny och alexander bergman my favorite film ever yet i can only watch it once in awhile because like a rare bottle of wine served with blinis and fresh oysters it is something that must not be over done a great great film that should be in every movie lover s library 
hey guys and girls don t ever rent or may god forbid buy this piece of garbage i have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one the acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were and in the grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings in fact we would have been taken up to evaluation for the oscars if we were to be compared to the actors in darkhunters the story is terrible the makeup is terrible the filming is terrible the set is terrible the directing is terrible etc i can t actually find anything worth the money spent to see this film maybe except all the cats which my girlfriend thought were kind of cute please use your money on other things than on this film i couldn t even see the last minutes of the film it was that terrible if anyone really liked this film i would really like to hear from you and i will try to see if i can get you some counseling at a psychiatrist s office near you out of actually below if possible not worth the dvd or tape it is on 
don t quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldn t have been much comedy i also don t think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesn t change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic i d say but happy it s a light hearted movie with a feel good ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and i m glad they didn t show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly 
cujo is a movie adaptation of a novel of the same name written by stephen king i ve never read the novel but just scanning the comments page has given me some insight i noticed a reference to the change in the ending the plot of the movie is as follows a st bernard dog gets bitten by a rabid bat and goes on a killing spree the plot sounds quite worn now having been done in various movies however it might have been something new when king wrote the novel or perhaps king s novel put a twist on the story that was never shown in the movie anyway the first minutes of this movie have nothing at all worth mentioning other than the dog being bitten nothing else happens nothing scary nothing funny nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect i found this section difficult to sit through and was constantly shouting at the tv come on get started the events that i was seeing on the screen were reminiscent of a tv movie of the drama genre or an extended episode of a tv soap opera unfortunately there was only one family in the movie given any focus so it couldn t even work on a soap opera level the dog was the best character in the movie but it didn t get enough screen time in this section there was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a killing spree later after the minute mark point something finally happened the dog suddenly transformed from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine it began attacking some people there was also an interesting cat and mouse chase when two characters became trapped in a car unable to leave because the dog would attack them even in this overly long second half the suspense would build up well before dying again it was just a stop go situation repeated over and over again until the movie reached its conclusion without giving the ending away i can tell you it was very formulaic and unworthy of a stephen king story the suspense scenes when they are on the screen are exciting to watch some great camera angles add menace to the dog s vicious nature when he attacks people this is particularly important because as others have mentioned a st bernard dog is nowhere near as scary as say a rottweiler unfortunately the movie fails to utilise suspenseful music to support the images on the screen the music is far too melodramatic rather than suspenseful this may fit a tv movie but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark toned movie presenting a living nightmare to the viewer this brings me on to a wider problem with this movie the photography the camera work and especially the choice of colours make this seem like a very cheap tv movie one would expect to see as the daytime movie on channel here in the uk where i am writing this comment from the top two actors deliver good acting performances that help to breathe life into the movie s dull segments dee wallace and danny pintauro should be given credit for doing a great job with the poor material they are given i could forgive a few brief moments of overacting by paying closer attention to the dialogue which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion i won t pass judgement on the other actors because they are given virtually nothing to do as someone who is a fan of salem s lot and stephen king s it both movie adaptations of famous stephen king novels i had high expectations for this movie but it turned out to be a massive disappointment overall i do not recommend fans of stephen king or horror movies in general to watch cujo this is one of those moments where i have to recommend the book rather than the movie hopefully it brings the story to life in a way that the movie failed to do 
i saw this movie in the early s when i was about yrs old on tv it was on after school and as i watched i was so drawn into the whole idea of the two astronauts going on a mission to another undiscovered planet that i asked my mom if i could get the cassette recorder out she let me so i wrapped the cord of the mic around the channel knob so the mic was hanging in front of the speaker this movie is the first one i ever paid enough attention to and cared enough about to record just the audio there were no vcrs at the time the plot will have you hanging onto every word every minute of this film the ending will blow your mind after watching the journey to the far side of the sun you will have flash backs in your mind about it for a long time i did replay the audio recording for many years and saw it over and over in my mind then maybe years later when vcr s were common and they sold tapes in stores i always looked for it but never found it but when the internet came along one day i searched for it and purchased it in a second so after about years after seeing it for the first time i got to see it again wow it was spectacular just for reference i must have watched it times since 
what looks like a ho hum porky s rip off turns out to be quite a touching film about being young and in love the story concerns three friends gary ricky and david who spend their after school hours looking for sex when a new girl arrives in town gary falls head over heels in love with her the film goes from being a sleazy sex film to an examination of teenage insecurities it is funny and sad at the same time it never completely gives into that love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made you know the guy meets girl guy loses girl guy gets girl back in the final frame formula that formula is tossed aside after guy meets girl maybe that is why i liked the film so much the soundtrack is especially good and the ending is a definite tear jerker it also might be one of the most realistic endings i ve ever seen in a love story 
the producer matt mochary stumbled upon the film s subject anderson sa leader of the afroreggae music movement when on a hewlett foundation trip to rio de janeiro mochary was so moved by sa s story that he called his friend nyc filmmaker jim zimbalist who quit his job and joined mochary in brazil to work on a documentary on sa rio s favelas and the culture of violence the first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in rio s favelas shantytowns where the poor live via footage of police raids and assaults on the residents the footage is graphic and shocking rising from the negativity of the favelas is the charismatic anderson sa who overcame a possible career in drug dealing to start the afroreggae movement which combines elements of afro brazilian culture reggae ska and other elements into a fast paced percussion heavy style of music which has since spread to other parts of the world you can t help but be carried away by the music especially when you see the local children get involved in sa s school which he founded to keep kids out of drug gangs the rest of the film follows sa s meteoric rise and his positivity changes many of the children s lives to seek a life beyond drug running spoiler just when the filmmakers thought they had wrapped filming an unbelievable life changing event occurs of which the resolution has to be seen to be believed the film then continues and you are gripped in your seat until the end this film is a response to city of god and a worthy one at that the bleak situation portrayed in that movie is countered by a real example of how favela dwellers can overcome the dire situation they are in and use their resources to constructive ends you can t help not liking and rooting for anderson sa to succeed this film is terrifically shot fast paced and is quite absorbing judging by the overwhelming response of the audience at last night s silverdocs screening the film should get domestic distribution in the us and the thumping soundtrack should be released as well keep an eye for this superlative documentary it is excellent 
before i start to tear apart this movie mark you i love the scarlet pimpernel that story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written the movie staring jane grey is very good and the musical on broadway is the hottest thing there so i thought when i heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a bbc film to my surprise it was a weak totally stupid story that utterly failed in capturing the gorgeous tale there were no exciting escapes with daring disguises there was no deep love that made your heart flutter as percy left the room and marguerite sighed as her husband was leaving her again all it had was a confusing plot and a lot of out of the blue sex and violence sink me what a horrible movie 
if you re like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies i guess it s kind of like slowing down at a car crash you can t do better than this the plot is inane the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you ll ever see thumbs down wooohoooooooo seriously i have no idea how the director and the actors can sleep at night it s painful and yet hysterically funny to watch and i highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something if you can watch this crap without wincing you re a better man than i ll ever be i wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was getting himself and his money into 
any film school student could made a film times better than piece of garbage as someone who had read the book i expected even a straight re telling of the book would make this a fair film there was a chance that a talented director could go beyond woodward s narrative and make a great film well the director did go beyond woodward s narrative he added a hip hispanic angel named velasquez that was not in the book he had bob woodward interview the dead belushi in an exchange in the morgue the film had all the insight of someone stoned on pcp staring at his navel if this is a spoiler to you you will thank me for it because it is absolutely the worst movie ever made 
and obviously i didn t see it but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead i know now to avoid this like the plague i hate it when hollywood producers writers directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they re not going to catch continuity errors a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one won t you say and i can t believe that someone like louis gossett jr would return for something like that did jason gedrick really decline this well i hate to say it but even if he took the role again it would have still had that same continuity error i bet if he really turned it down he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second film i ll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd 
i just finished up this unofficial adaptation of h p lovecraft s the lurking fear that was shot in louisiana outside of a few changes names setting this follows the short story point by point for the first minutes but then tries to inject its own twist ending that you could see coming from a mile away either way it is a much better adaptation than full moon s the lurking fear too bad it is a terrible film director david mccormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short i swear i counted maybe two camera movements the creature design is cheap we re talking store bought masks here but shot in a dark manner intentional or not where they are somewhat creepy the most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion but mccormick fails to exploit that as well file this one under good adaptation poor execution 
found this film in a dvd discount rack for it wasn t worth it some of the camera work and dialog look and sound as if it were done by a film student sandra s performance was somewhat credible but the film was predictable and the action was spotty and dragged one thing that i will give them however unlike most action films people in this film actually ran out of ammo and scavanged dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition 
i rented this movie for about the most complete waste of money and time i have ever spent it s lame i couldn t believe how they could come up with something like this the plot there is no plot everything you d expect to happen it does only in a worse way the acting was horrible my dog could ve done better the special effects have no effect whatsoever except inducing complete disbelief and the cheesy lines i mean why even bother the only credit i can give this piece of sh t are the opening scenes they were actually quite pretty and one of the reasons why i decided to rent this the graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic cg of the entire film total reality gets out of for not being able to mark it lower 
watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish the story is always entertaining the tension never loosing up the whole cast is wonderful the teaming of walken and bracco works to perfection it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut i can imagine it s sort of a parody of the one burt lancaster had in elmer gantry for me it added to the pleasure it s the first movie i saw miguel ferrer in probably one of the most under appreciated movie actors of his generation he s very good in a small role as bracco s pimp even the jamaican thugs are a sight to behold i can highly recommend this movie 
i honestly dont know why so many people hate this movie i have always thought that it was one of my absolute faves the fight with tiger and his men rocked the fight with the pirates with the axes rocked the whole skit with everyone trying to avoid one another in the house is pure genious ok so it didnt have the requisite kick ass final confrontation but the manchus were pretty good i give it a 
isabelle huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is staid unfriendly and distant in public and bitter towards her students privately she seethes with violence and frustration and her sexual life is solitary and perverse she lives with her overbearing mother who obsessively drives her to become noticed and so advance in life as a talented pianist the key to the characters of both mother and daughter is obsession these characters cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death the piano teacher meets a young attractive talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her they start a relationship in the most unconventional way but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun the film ties itself to the female lead isabelle huppert amazes with a brutal completely convincing performance as the piano teacher she cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses as a film that is so character driven you know it would not work half as well had she acted poorly this is powerful intelligently acted and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel the camera work also suits the film there are what i can only think to call framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about this is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall and is a further testament to the director s mastery expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film but be brave have the guts to go and see it this is a very private look into essentially one person s life but do not expect to be entertained in the hollywood sense there are no car chases in this film 
i managed to record the dion brothers off broadcast tv with the commercials back in the early s i ve loaned it to many friends all of whom agree it s one of the best b bandit movies ever made one day while walking to my nyc apartment i saw stacy keach shooting a scene for his tv series mickey spilane we had a moment to chat and i told him how much i enjoyed the dion bros and considered it a pure classic he thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable film experiences of his career he was very friendly and sincere and i was grateful for the few moments he took to chat with a fan this is one classic that needs to be on dvd 
the recent dvd release of good humor man labels the film as comedy it s hardly a comedy rather a dull indie film about a group of losers supposedly set in the s there is scant attention paid to period details with overly muted color correction taking its place the monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film perhaps that is the point but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location the bleachers it seems like the packaging of the film as a comedy is meant to deceive people into renting or buying this film which is a complete waste of time 
returning from years in china a young missionary refuses to become the cat s paw for a gang of hometown hoodlums this movie was a bit of a departure from harold lloyd s previous movies comedy derived more from dialogue often rather serious predominates here rather than the elaborate sight gags which powered harold s classics of the past there are some splendid moments however which are pure visual fun as when harold attempts to follow a convertible down a crowded street or when he desperately tries to keep a nightclub stripper from losing her clothes there is also the climactic scene set in a chinatown basement in which harold gleefully jumps unabashedly into the darkest comedy but most of the humor derives from harold s refusal to be the patsy of the criminals who ve run his hometown for years and it s quite a collection of crooked politicians thugs harold finds himself up against played by a bevy of fine character actors george barbier nat pendleton grant mitchell edwin maxwell alan dinehart warren hymer stuttering fuzzy knight pert una merkel is on hand as the tobacco stand girl who catches harold s eye and keeps him intrigued by her no nonsense outlook on life movie mavens will recognize samuel s hinds as harold s missionary father charles sellon as an elderly stockport clergyman and herman bing as a german gangster all uncredited also showing up for only a few seconds as an attempted kidnapper is noah young a familiar face from harold s silent films here making his final appearance in a lloyd picture fox gave the film fine production values especially in the opening scenes set in china 
i wish there was a category to place this in other than horror it simply isn t granted it has it s horrific moments however i don t feel that makes it a horror film i will give that this movie could have been better a million little things could have been changed to make it better that having been said i love this movie i m often sad that people misunderstand the whole point of it it has always been clear to me that the point of this movie was to say things aren t always what they seem sometimes evil isn t barker was at a con i went to and he did a little talk then watch the movie thing it was very interesting many things he wished to put in the movie couldn t be and a chunk was cut out of the movie that he believed to be long lost this was a chunk that helped shed light on boone and his girlfriend as well as some other details i know some people are bothered by not having more information about all of the breed in the background however i always felt that gave the movie a more real fleshed out feel i have read the novella this was based off of as well as many of the comics because of this the movie just always seemed like a staging ground for the whole story a much more involved story that sadly has never has a chance to live despite all of the flaws this movie might have i believe it has a lot to offer the monsters are wonderful very imaginative while the acting is sometimes a bit stiff there are some very quotable lines whenever i watch it i find something new keep and eye on boones chest toward the end at one point decker stabs him and shortly after boone falls on a card table he ends up with a card stuck to his chest this card stays there for a while even after lori pulls the knife out it stays there until boone casually removes it i love that that was a lovely little detail i thought basically what i want to say is that if you are looking for a horror movie don t watch this if you believe that at times men can be more evil than anything we have ever dreamed up this is the movie for you this is a movie about how men destroy what they don t understand or fear 
the only good thing about this movie is that i now have a movie on the worst ever list rest stop being on the end of the spectrum where i can compare all terrible movies to really this movie is the worst plot worst directed throughout the whole movie all i wanted to do is pull out my hair and kick the writer s and anybody who made this movie possible s ass i am a deployed soldier and when i spend my precious downtime watching movies like this these people should feel terrible they had to of watch this before it came out and must have been to freaking lazy to redo after they noticed it freaking sucked i am so amazed that this great country of ours is letting them make another honestly this is the first time i have ever commented on a movie i had to let the world know not to waste their time delete this movie from the face of this planet it makes us humans look retarded 
being a wrestling fan movies about wrestling generally suck backyard dogs bodyslam jesse ventura story but this one isn t the worst i ve ever seen yes its bad but its better than some of the others i ve mentioned hulk hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn t want to be on that network let me explain it so everyone can understand picture usa network having rip and tnt will go to any lengths to get him does this make sense no well don t feel bad because it doesn t make sense nor does it make sense to have a legit ex con have a real fight with rip at the end of the movie none of this movie makes much sense but compared to other wrestling movies and later hogan films its not so bad out of 
this movie had great production values good lighting costumes set cinematography and acting but someone somewhere took the script and replaced all the dialogue with grade school level barely literate writing i felt my iq dropping points any time any character spoke did they do this on purpose was this just an accident of brain dead studio executives at this point we don t know all i know is this movie was one great mistake from beginning to end we don t even get to see how the squad became cops so instead of any character development we get what feels like a bad tv movie leftover from the s or whenever find the screenwriters beat them with a sock full of quarters everyone else nice work but read your scripts next time 
i first viewed they died with there boots on about and though it has been many years since this film and its impression remain the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic when i first saw this film i knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then some i felt then as i even feel now that the silver screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone the life of george armstrong custer however the director raoul walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when i watched a semi documentary with other great directors like vincent mennelli wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the hollywood mind set this is what i considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable yet there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as well custer ranked in a graduating class of much has been made of custer s final class ranking but of the cadets who entered the military academy with him in half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation day june it is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of george armstrong custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the sargeant on duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accident his squadron would follow him to hell your at attention sargeant reprimands tape if iam not mistaken when flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable attach to not only sheridan but hancocks forces as well only to end up for a time with the army of the potomac under general george mcclellan there is some truth to the audacity attributed to custers battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack young custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned confederates as a lone union soldier surrounded by rebels custers audacity shone through he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers including a rebel captain yet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first confederate battle flag taken by the army of the potomac this notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise robert l bateman armchair general there is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to george armstrong custer the story is good hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposes though this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that tom custer was to lose his life at the little big horn only a few feet from where george custer was to die as well they were brothers and tom custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only others to have been awarded the medal of honor twice in his military career the list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that custers indeed was an active young officer he was not with union forces at either chancellorsville or for that matter fredericksburg however he was with them at the battle of antietam and at that point in time he was actually promoted to captain by general mcclellan but that was not to last as mcclellan was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that the army of the potomac had the means and the information discovered wrapped around some cigars was general lee s plans to split his forces and yet he failed to act for some hours it can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when mcclellan failed to act president lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result custers greatest victory may of in fact come at gettysburg pa his forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at gettysburg in the summer of were able to defeat a jeb stuart led cavalry of some rebels with but a force of i think the heroics at gettysburg by custer are worth some discussion there is speculation had in the movie that custers appointment was a blunder well you better guess again because not only did custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the governor of the state of michigan which by the way was relatively new to the union cause and where preparing to form cavalry regiments though custer was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he showed up in all that gold braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believe the truth be told custers defense at gettysburg prohibited jeb stuart from having lunch at the unions rear stores and vitally protected that flank this action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with picketts charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of success it was a critical victory and custer was at his bravest and best his men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it 
never having seen an oliver stone film before nor any films starring eric bogosian i didn t know what to expect from this film having toyed with the idea of buying it for a while i finally got it for free as a supplement with a sunday newspaper and i was hugely impressed it tells the story of barry champlain a talk radio host who can be incredibly rude towards his callers often putting them in their place before they realise what s going on though this is what has made him a popular radio show host it has also earned him numerous enemies the acting in this film was hugely impressive with not one dud actor in it eric bogosian is brilliant as barry champlain the troubled talk radio host with alec baldwin turning in a strong performance as barry s boss dan it also features the voice of and cameo appearance by michael wincott my reason for wanting to see this the story was really well written as despite his arrogance you feel for barry as more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is i d recommend this film to anyone as it is captivating and more importantly real on numerous levels two of which being that is was inspired by the life of an actual talk radio host and the fact that you do actually get radio show hosts and callers like the ones featured in the film in reality high recommendation and aye yours cat squire
this is one of those made for tv b movies that is so awful it kind of endears bad acting predictable script and cheesy special effects that were pretty much some of the cheapest tat seen make you have to keep watching to see if it gets any better it doesn t 
this was one of the most emotional movies i have seen passion pleasure pain despair sorrow healing cleansing and love the entire movie was spellbinding everything was done so well the adaptation from the book the actors the sets the camera shots this movie touched me deeply in so many ways it reminded me of the despair that loosing your love can have and the time it takes to heal that wound you may love again but will always be risking the pain that comes with separation is this not one of the most important age old questions is it better to have love and lost than to never have loved before ascension
a milestone in cinematic history bronenosets potyomkin is one of the handful of great films out there that richly deserves to be called a classic it was the picture that made sergei m eisenstein a figurehead of film making at the time and today it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema it always has been potyomkin is a film that needs to be seen as one entity not to be picked at don t just watch those clip shows where they only present the odessa steps sequence and then move on to citizen kane or the godfather see it all in it s glorious minute running time to really understand and enjoy it don t expect every infinitesimal detail to be perfect though i mean the acting of the s silent era makes scooby doo look like a master of understated realism certain plot points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequences look dated but it is still an immensely enjoyable movie the most memorable moments in the film are the mutiny on the battleship vakulinchuk s body falling off the ship the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier the mother holding her dead child the baby carriage on the odessa steps and the lion rising up to roar as further carnage ensues for each new pair of eyes that look upon it the battleship potemkin comes alive once again 
this movie reminded me of the live dramas of the s not like the recent failsafe which seemed more of a stunt than anything else but a true moral drama that is both engaging and thought provoking anne heche is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior played by sam shepard and eric stoltz is wonderful as her lawyer defending her against the military establishment i found myself waiting for their affair to begin if only because they look so good together this movie is apparently based on a true story and it s a relief to be asked to think about real issues for a change directed by christopher menaul who also did the passion of ayn rand with stolz and the prime suspect series this is a movie with panache and style and is absolutely worth seeing 
this was indeed an amazing adaption i missed the first episode so i unfortunately missed out on the bonding between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline but as soon i watched the second and then the third instalment i was just blown away i ordered the dvd less than a week later and unable to wait for it to come i went straight out and brought the book from the moment i opened it i was hooked i just couldn t put it down i decided to finish the whole book before i dare watch the dvd at all i preferred the book because it got inside the characters minds you could understand totally where they were coming from and what there role was within the story they missed a lot out of the adaption which was disappointing as the book is a master piece and i think they could have done it superbly if they had been able to stretch it over a longer period of time but considering only being able to be fitted into a hour slot i think it was done excellent it followed the main twisted storyline brilliantly and the actors which were enrolled as the main characters where amazing the love making scene was pure beautiful it was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be i was totally blown away with both the book and the tv adaption i loved both of sarah waters previous novels and also found the tipping the velvet adaption quite enjoyable but when i read and watched fingersmith i knew none of her previous novels adaption could beat it sarah waters has indeed exceeded herself this time i recommend that you watch this adaption if tipping the velvet wasn t your thing then don t let it put you off this one fingersmith is a whole new ball game it is a beautiful yet dark twisted story about love greed and betrayal a must see 
number was really great summer popcorn fun it was the modern jaws number is best summed up by jeff goldblum in the movie about being the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas or something like that number is the obituary notice jp has achieved all it ever will once they realized they had no fresh ideas they should have just let sleeping dinos lie that said movie is ok if you don t mind knowing you already have seen it before 
if you feel reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on tv try watching him in the movie for hours straight his face is bland all throughout the movie and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes this is way far from a real love story get the spelling right reshammiya it is not luv or reeal and is complete with him doing a mithun da dance auto rickshaw fight scenes himesh getting imprisoned himesh accused of murder he fleeing from prison etc if you want a good laugh there is nothing like this one especially the scenes where he howls in mehbooba if you despise the nasal twangs and want to know out of curiosity what two hours of reshammiya can do to you then don t miss this movie i couldn t stop laughing from the beginning till the very end the only saving grace that this movie has are the cinematography locations and a couple of the songs even then until you are a die hard reshammiya fan avoid this movie at all costs 
i saw this movie awhile back and can t seem to track it down does anyone know where i can get a hold of it i feel it is worth seeing again i m sorry to say i had never heard of chloe nicholle until this film yes she can act when i first began to track this movie down i mistook it for another one of her movies sex spa the plot seems similar to me but the roles are reversed this is the first film i ve seen dru berrymore i looked up some of her other films and i feel she looks better as a blonde i agree this is a good introductory movie not too soft not too hard you got to start somewhere 
after seeing this movie i have no choice but to write a review in the hopes that there are others like me out there who were blown away by the rocket fueled ninja action and white hot sexual titillation that is ninja iii the domination we all know that sho kosugi rocks that is a given but how about jordan bennett s ultra macho interpretation of his character police officer billy secord bravo mr bennett bravo you prove early on while trying to seduce the buxom christie played to perfection by one miss lucinda dickey of breakin fame that you are not afraid to take chances on your craft i particularly enjoyed how you do not feel the need to step in and attempt to help her as thugs try to rape her outside her gym oh you could have helped sure but by standing there and watching you let her know who was boss secord will wear the pants in this relationship i also enjoyed how mr bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off his shirt or wear the wife beater tank top despite his gorilla like shoulders and back back and shoulder hair are hot and secord knows it and how about lucinda dickey all i can say is kaboom i see a sex bomb getting ready to explode she s got all the right moves as both a temptress and a martial arts whiz the chemistry behind dickey and bennett is what makes this movie tick you d think she would hate him because he s kind of a cheesy jerk but no my friends the animal magnetism is too strong to resist and they bond like crazy glue sho kasugi is not as prominent as you might think though still a main character which is fine by me because all i wanted was more bennett and dickey he does seem to wear a lot of eye makeup which was nice to see the special effects wow that is all i can say i will not give away the ending but let s just say it will not disappoint i love ninja iii the domination and can only hope that there is a ninja i give it a out of throwing stars disappoint 
the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than brideless groom all appearing in this short are dee green the beautiful christine mcintyre doris houck alyn lockwood johnny kascier nancy saunders and emil sitka green and mcintyre provide great performances here there are so many funny parts here this is a very hilarious short there is another similar three stooges short like this one called husbands beware and i recommend both 
a young couple decides to runaway to sunny california they never reach their destination as they decide to pull over at the rest stop after a fight with her boyfriend nicole carrow insists on pulling in to a rest stop when she is ready to leave she exits the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared with their car leaving her trapped on the back roads of texas with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company rest stop is one of those cheap and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic will rest stop become a cult classic you may ask well the three elements that you need to become a cult classic are gore sex and artistic merit rest stop has bucket loads of gore and while i do not want to give too much away it contains oodles of blood soaked nastiness this movie has everything from the bad guy running over a cop s legs with his car several times to him making use of a pneumatic drill on a girl s leg at times it can be about as bloody as a film can get it also has a gratuitous and yet somehow quite intimate love scene in the opening minutes of the film therefore the sex is covered now the hard one does it have any artistic merit you never get to see the bad guy s face you see glimpses profiles shadowy silhouettes he is a faceless relentless monster which alone scores highly on the artistic merit scale the movie has very few characters in it apart from the main protagonist nicole carrow jaimie alexander since she spends a large part of the film on her own she cannot reveal her thoughts in the course of a conversation but must speak them aloud so that we the audience know what she is thinking at times this can be slightly irritating however it is a brave step by the writer john shiban and it does work for the majority of the film as an audience knows being completely alone and isolated from civilisation is frightening enough even when you are not being chased by psychotic killers so will rest stop become a cult classic it probably will because along the gore sex and arguable artistic merit it also has plenty of chills an interesting and inventive plot and gives rise to a lot of shouting at the screen as the main character does plenty of things you should definitely not do when running from a psychotic killer what fun are horror movies if you cannot complain about the stupidity of the victims 
as a fan of c j s earlier movie latter days i really wanted to like this film the nicest thing i can say however is that it s not an awful film there are some good performances and a few funny scenes in particular tori spelling has a couple of great scenes where she s talking to her fianc s ex boyfriend overall though it s pretty week the script falls back on weird coincidences and clich d movie moments way too often the main character went to stanford on a golf scholarship and his high school buddy doesn t even know that he plays the game most of the time this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say there are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time and you could easily cut half the characters from the film without losing anything still for all it s faults i would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years which says a lot about how bad most gay films are i m hoping c j s next film will be better 
oh my goodness i would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than domestic disturbance this soon but here it is armed with rotten plot terrible editing stilted acting and headache inducing style sorry i have no other words for it sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re evaluate an entire genre that is this film is so bad that even the thrillers i condemned as complete failures now seem a little better now not only sanctimony is a terrible film in itself it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it right from the main titles nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from se en i was under the impression that something didn t smell quite right as soon as the movie started with a series of corny wanna be hip quick cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors i knew where that smell was coming from it turns out that two policemen or rather policeman jim renart michael par and policewoman dorothy smith jennifer rubin are investigating on a murder spree in vancouver a serial killer known as monkey killer what a menacing chilling nickname uh for his working methods has killed quite a lot of people you see this nut apparently works following the proverb see no evil hear no evil speak no evil and cuts eyes ears and tongues out of his victims so far six eyes six ears and three tongues in very ingenious fashion renart and smith figure out that the monkey killer is probably going to kill other three people well because he probably wants to complete the number so suddenly the film focuses on tom gerrick casper van dien a young successful good looking businessman with a dreadful temper and that s where the rip off of american psycho kicks in so we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath none of which is interesting in the least until they finally meet along the way to that a disco where renart barely misses gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory renart goes in the back of the disco club because well just because the script tells us it s a suspect place then with one single punch in the stomach renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path and the guard is never heard of again does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic anyway after another murder gerrick turns in as a witness but smith and especially renart immediately suspect he might be the killer in typical basic instinct fashion smith gets some dates with the young businessman under the assumption that she might discover his true identity i won t spoil the ending but it is quite simply an embarrassment there are contradictions some plot holes issues that never get resolved and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder supposed to be shocking and sad comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that i frankly can t imagine how anyone could not laugh at it at minutes sanctimony is really pushing it you never care about one single character because they are all so flat not to mention boring that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them you are never pulled into the story because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place the acting ranges from average van dien to downright atrocious rubin and most of the supporting cast the music is abysmal generic techno and the photography is one of the worst i have ever seen of course like every fiasco of the genre we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity 
this movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the left behind series i did not know it would be a bible thumping movie i expected it to truly be a movie about ufos and alien abduction for entertainment s sake as previous reviewer comments it would be fine to show at a church but not at a public theater at least not without the consumer s prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about i felt deceived out of my spent for this movie as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones if you go to church it ll probably be shown there for free some time other than the cover up of its true subject matter the movie was fine as far as acting and script were concerned but i have to say i walked out an hour into the movie when i saw what direction it was headed and that i was not going to be entertained but preached to 
enigma is a computer part which scrambles russian messages so that america can t understand them they can only be read by the intended recipient the americans know that the russians are going to transmit a message revealing the plans of five political assassinations they want to carry out so they send in former defector holbeck martin sheen to grab the scrambler and substitute a false part so they ll be able to decode the message and block the assassination attempts however as we listen in on the americans heads of the spy organisation we find that they already have the scrambler and they want holbeck to try to steal enigma only to convince the russians that they don t already have it they don t expect holbeck to succeed that way the russians who had stopped transmitting with enigma just in case will begin transmitting again enigma is in the computer in the office of dimitri vasilikov somehow holbeck must gain access and in order to do that he must find out when vasilikov will be out he sends in his former girlfriend karen brigitte fossey to seduce vasilikov so that she can look through his papers and find out his scheduled movements karen is glad to do it as they tortured her father a university professor to death because we know that it s better for the americans if holbeck fails the movie becomes even more intense as a spy thriller we find ourselves hoping he can survive against the odds especially as he uses ingenious methods to beat the russians at every turn but what s this are karen and vasilikov falling in love will holbeck win karen back or will she actually end up with vasilikov the romantic twist lifts this spy thriller already worthy of a ten even higher for its originality the writing the direction and the acting all combine to make this new and fascinating twist a compellingly realistic one you find yourself at the edge of your seat gripping your armchair not only for the excitement of the spy story but for the intensely beautiful romantic love story as well the two themes are interwoven perfectly right up to the end you really want both sides to win so who does win in the end you ll have to see the movie and find out won t you 
shakalaka boom boom is a rip off from the movie amadeus i personally rate amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it is about music which is my favorite subject but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music he produced during his life time but for his own self destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of being virtually uncelebrated during his life time because of the politics played by some people particularly saliere the italian composer who was jealous of him personally i was shocked to see shakalaka as the director has invariably cut pasted most of the scenes from the movie amadeus i see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and am skeptic about the kind of movies bollywood keeps on churning day by day the movie is a disaster the two musicians in the movie don t give you any feeling of being realistic the film is tasteless meaningless and total failure on every count the only person who makes an impact is bobby deol who at least knows how to act otherwise the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs the irony is that while watching the movie the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance with anyone is purely coincidental which is a blatant lie because all resemblances are very much clear and they are very much intended i wish i could take darshan and co to court not only for copyright infringement but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art 
the idea is not original if you have seen such kind of story before you would know what the ending would come out after watching for the first twenty minutes the script the positioning of the actors and the screening is too obvious if you haven t seen such story before it is definitely a good experience you will enjoy the twist at the end don t forget to watch it again after you know the truth you will even more enjoy the plots even though i have a right guess at the very beginning i still couldn t help stick on my seat till the end conclusion a must see this one from korea is better than any recent movies of the genre from japan forget hollywood don t miss it 
what can be said about one of the greatest n games ever that the action is fast enough to keep even a seasoned fps veteran sweating bullets quite literally that the graphics are great down to the explosions that everyone loves to see that nothing is quite as fun as playing multiplayer mode and shooting your friends and siblings in the back with submachine guns very little beats goldeneye about the only thing missing was voice acting and a bit more intelligence in the enemy soldiers if you have an n and you like shooting people and things crossed with espionage get a copy of this 
this review is for the uk dvd three disc box set disc one is called caught in the act and contains model behavior chasing jamie and fast and curious disc two is called bedroom fantasies and contains blue plate special falling in lust again and love potion no the final disc is called anything goes and contains chatroom she s the boss and legally yours why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material each episode opens with the hotel manager chloe lauren hayes reading a letter from a satisfied customer we then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel blue plate special is the exception because this story is from a waitress the writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines for instance model behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew falling in lust again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel she s the boss is about a put upon male secretary dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised much to her pleasure all the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex it should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down the sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false the camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything and as usual we get loud music during the sex action finally the end credits mention the palm canopy hotel singer island florida although my map of florida shows no singer island the scenery certainly looks more like florida than utah or las vegas that some people have mentioned this is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release stars 
the animal eating geek scenes were not as bad as you would think after having watched mondo cane and mondo magic these scenes are average the grossest one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse but they were so fast and few that they didn t bother me otherwise the film was just sort of interesting i always like hearing the silly voice overs they never sound like what you think the actor actress would sound like in real life i liked the bright colors worn by the princesses the shots of weird looking bugs were cool too the youngest princess looked really young almost or something the fight scenes were not as long and boring as most fight scenes so that was good 
time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent the plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves there are of course complications the problem with the film for me is that it hasn t aged well performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable one late exchange where carol lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery there are other times when the film becomes static a sign of the limitations of the microphones its not a bad film its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment normally i m forgiving but this time out i just couldn t go with the flow then again the copy i saw was absolutely horrible worth a shot in a forgiving mood and to be reminded that robert armstrong actually did more than play carl denham in king kong 
i went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night i m years old and this movie was way too much for me i couldn t imagine taking a teenager preteen or especially a child to this movie it was crude and offensive i was totally misled by its pg rating and the previews that i had seen for it i had originally seen previews for it on nickelodeon and i thought that it looked pretty cute maybe i just don t remember the preview correctly plus drake bell the movie s main character stars on a nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teenagers i really didn t think that the movie s content would be as risky as it was i should have done more research about it before i went however i m hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has drake bell in it seriously do not take your kids or teenagers to see this movie the rating should have been r there are tons of sexual references drug references and disturbing events throughout the movie examples drake bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals several scenes that involve men grabbing women s breasts lots of profanity drake bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting or something like that people get stabbed hit and hurt in the movie and an elderly lady and her dog get shredded there are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie it was really demeaning to women in general the movie is by the people that made the scary movie series so that should tell you something right there please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex drugs and violence most children and teenagers can t decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality i do have a sense of humor i also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre but i find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie horrifying as for the overall quality of the movie i didn t think it was that original or funny it dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful the acting wasn t too bad considering how bad the script was if you re an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie skip this one or rent it 
this movie is an evolutionary piece from terminator to robocop stan winston did the spfx in this film a scientist working in a sinister robotics company with a really creepy boss they always are gets is killed by them in a horrible lab explosion and has his brain placed inside an indestructible robot body the rest of this movie goes on with a romance angle as this cyborg man regains consciousness and wreaks havoc while trying to communicate with his wife played by the gorgeous back then in terri austin he tries to reconnect with his old life like in that scene in robocop the rest of this movie is about breaking things while trying to defeat the evil his evil boss from recapturing him for some ill defined turn humans into cyborgs project this film pays homage to previous movies like the day the earth stood still as the cyborg breaks free like the giant robot gort does except for the frankenstein suite designed by stan winston this movie s production values are typically canadian sleazy pam grier stars in this film as an hired killer commando a cheap role of the likes she was doing so much of during the s as for a sci fi horror b movie out of stars this film ranks about a 
this was one of the best half hour horror suspense fantasy shows of the eighties without a doubt granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode and it stank as far as production values i e the sets went but darn it i have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots i mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even i a hardened horror movie shock film and s grind house buff got a little sickened and creeped out great show just great regardless of what the other reviewers have said here my favorite episode was called bug house yeah that was the title i think anyhow it still gives me the willies every time i think about it to this day almost years after it first premiered other shows like tales from the darkside the outer limits and of course the twilight zone were definitely better production values wise but in my opinion they ain t got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show it definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was tales from the crypt 
i disagree with the reviewer who disagreed with the reviewer who gave this short movie an f grade cashing in heavily on political propaganda only obscures joe dante s lack of ability to pull another howling out of his bag of tricks the masters of horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales save for this episode despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote it s political slant homecoming is the least effective episode of moh season one unlike the rest of the series dante s entry is a parody of the genre falling short of both horror and humor in it s ham fisted delivery of a hackneyed political point dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf as it wasn t his creation the zombie sub genre is very popular this decade and among the crop of predictable george romero tributes and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or ir religeous messages such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans maybe dante really isn t a a master of horror either what has he been up to since the howling after all if you want a lame anti war zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humor homecoming may be just your thing if you are a horror fan looking for something masterful pick up most any other episode of the series my personal favorite was dario argento s jenifer based loosely on a classic comic short by the team of bruce jones and berni wrightson truly creepy 
insanely well crafted mini series i recall seeing most of it twice when shown on american playhouse on pbs was heavily promoted at the time i believe it might have been one of the very early mini series showing on pbs outside of the masterpiece theater series the full length production was shown i believe only once during its first broadcast was hours total this length was edited down somewhat to hours cut some interesting but slow scenes i am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete not edited version to dvd not worth creating a vhs version at this point would fit in very well in the mini series or dramatic history genre 
after seeing the dvd release of the blues brothers and their mention of wired on belushi s bio my boyfriend and i were hungry for more information on john belushi i had heard of wired but didn t know too much about it and found it way in the back of the local rental store i understand that dan akroyd was really p ed over this movie and i thought it was because it didn t portray them in a good light but that had nothing to do with it the movie starts out okay until they wheel in john s body to the morgue when he wakes up on the autopsy table and decides to run for it then begins the utter tastelessness of this movie john is subjected to viewing his life and all of the turmoil he created with angel a puerto rican cab driver with a wicked sense of humor subjecting him to criticism and attempting to try to get him to cross over the two actors who portray john and dan look nothing even remotely close to the real actors let alone anyone else related for that matter i e lorne michaels making it difficult to really try to concentrate on them and how they were in real life but that is the tip of the iceberg i believe this was supposed to be an artsy film john constantly being tormented by drugs i e the powdered soap in the bathroom being cocaine in such a way that was also difficult to follow the flashbacks are choppy also making it difficult to understand probably the most tasteless scene was when john is literally forced to undergo his autopsy and is in pain while they remove his heart to weigh it saying that it was abnormally large due to drug use obesity yeah we get the point without the grotesque portrayal there are very few other actors we know of in the movie where s carrie fisher for instance they were incredibly close and jim belushi would have been a great person to show it looks very cheaply made we felt it looked as if the graphics were from the early s or late s it felt as if it was filmed in about a week and all in all didn t show the side to john at all i felt i knew a little bit more about him from watching episodes of saturday night live on one last note bob woodward comes across narcissistic by placing himself in the movie arguing with john about writing his life story for someone who was supposed to be very highbrow concerning the bust on nixon his calibur of person could match any writer in the national enquirer and therefore losing my interest in any of his work from this point forward skip this movie if you want to see more on john watch his movies see clips of dan akroyd talking about him or hope someone has the taste to make another movie on john that goes along the lines of man on the moon which is ultimately what we were expecting i guess this was a moral kind of movie you know don t do drugs but i guess the creators of this film didn t understand that his death made a number of people like carrie fisher stop doing drugs altogether for that reason 
this film was sheer boredom from beginning to end ok so i salute boorman for raising the worldwide recognition of events in burma but that is all he achieves about minutes into the film i thought oh no here we go again and i could have told you exactly what was going to occur in the next minutes or so patricia arquette was out of her depth in such a role and her acting was wooden and unconvincing mind you being saddled with such an awfully conventional script maybe boredom set in and was such reflected on the screen a lot of the film was just plain laughable at one stage arquette s elderly companion is shot and he is prostrate on the ground in the next scene he is sprinting through the forest obviously attempting to break the world meters record or maybe he s just trying to run away from boorman if you find it hard to sleep one night then play beyond rangoon on your vcr and you ll be snoring in no time i very rarely critisize a film as heavily as this but in this case it is completely justified 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this there s a bunch of apes wandering about mumbling b acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period i can t believe there s even a sequel to this 
if only he hadn t bowed to clich mr shiban could have actually made a good film from this story it was just different enough to keep you interested so for the same amount of time energy and money as was spent on this stinker we might have had something good instead of eye rolling production wise it is as good as one could really expect from a hand held camcorder so he gets good marks there it s really the script that s at fault as the acting wasn t all that bad either considering what the actors had to work with i thought the days were long gone when we would see someone finding a radio transceiver they desperately wish to operate first turn every knob on the thing from end to end bash it on top or times and then expect it to work this story is ruined by a continuous string of stupid moves by all the characters except the bad guy it s as though we are thought to be too shallow to grasp all the plot devices so they are all spoon fed to us to make sure we get them i don t know about you but that doesn t work on me my attention ends up being occupied by the plot holes and over dramatizations not the story so since i found this to be not so bad in the technical sense i think mr shiban should try again only with a proper script next time then he might give us something worth watching 
i think the film makes a subtile reference to rouge of kieslowski as the whole atmosphere gives me a feeling of red it seems to be that a lot of the backgrounds contain red think of the tea room f e i also think this is one of the greatest movies of the last years 
sometimes you get exactly what you expect a film produced and by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback is not to be expected to rank high in artistic merit and in this case it certainly doesn t in fact as expected the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself which like the s rock and roll lifestyle it attempts to portray is characterized by excess drugs and over the top antics but unfortunately is not nearly as much fun utilizing a script by carl dupre horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter cringe and wasting the talents of edward furlong the sole highlight of this rock and roll period piece gone wrong is the music most notably the elaborate recreating of a kiss concert 
do not expect a classic military comedy which claims to make fun of the military while only enhancing a militaristic outlook instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine kind of east german version of buffalo soldiers nva works on a meta level that it sympathizes with its heroes attempts to escape from army drill any which way they can it s not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles utopian of course in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality but very thoughtful just to fill the required lines do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job 
 great news there is a bbc dvd release scheduled for st july uk there is also a scheduled release in states don t know the date can t wait below is my original comment i agree with all the other reviewers it is simply staggering that one of the greatest tv dramas ever has never been released on dvd the story line is gripping the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling over here in the uk we have quite a history of getting tv drama series and films out onto dvd through popular campaigns it s very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a dvd production i m going to e mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens who did the production was it bbc rw
oh f cking hell where should i start first of all this show is just another stupid american non funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor the american way of laughing track business makes the whole thing even worse how come i can hear laughter yet there s nothing funny happening pretty stupid eh this show is only for those american people who haven t ever heard that there are far more funnier better and wittier comedies not only in great brittain but also in america the simpsons for example i simply can t understand what is so good about reba that it has lasted for long a while in television it has nothing new to offer it underestimates the possible viewers in so many ways and it simply isn t funny at all i could have lived with the fact that there are so bad shows as reba but why the hell they had to run it here in finland if i see few seconds of this horrible show the rest of the day is ruined for me take my word and believe me this show sucks ass even more than these kind of american comedies usually does this is simply horrible do yourself a favor don t ever watch this peace of sh t well i leave the commenting for those who now this language better thanks for your possible interest 
i always say there s nothing like a good movie and i must say this was nothing like a good movie drab dull and tedious it was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end no matter how hard you try to wake up i don t mind the concept of a film without words ie entering a fantasy or dream world but there has to be something there to capture your imagination not just empty images which is what this film is there seemed to be no character development and it jumped so fast from scene to scene that it was hard to discern any story was there even a story you could tell the actors were trying their best but unfortunately poor direction sabotaged all the actors work it really seemed like a type of cinematic masturbation only existing to pleasure the director and nobody else big waste of time 
another hand held horror means another divisive movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds about imagine a cross between the blair witch project and the grudge and you re close to the overall content of this movie it s another videotaped horror but this time most of it is edited together in readiness for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared i certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie does anyone do dreadful better than our asian friends but the creepy moments the genuinely creepy moments were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than i had hoped i also felt that i was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent revelations appeared throughout so i certainly can t recommend this as highly as [ rec] having said that it would be remiss of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about ectoplasmic worms contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that i had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went down check it out if you have been enjoying some of the other hand held genre releases of late and the finale is a hair raising doozy see this if you like the last broadcast pulse angel heart 
when i first saw this movie in the theater i was so angry it completely blew in my opinion i didn t see it for a decade then decided what the hell let s see i m watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong my guess is it was with sequel that was the first to implement the whole i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff oh noes what is happening oh its a dream oh its not a dream oh wait i see something spooky oh never mind sucky storyline those sequels don t even require the box to be opened or stick to the rules from the first movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead the first hellraisers sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place nothing fantasy nothing weird the box got opened boom they came kirstey was the only one that could bargain her way out of it first because of uncle frank then because she had information about the cenobites this movie at least attempts to stick to all that even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser no i m pretty sure part was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series now they are remaking and i don t even think i will watch it oh who am i kidding i probably will and probably will be disappointed again 
this is another case of hollywood arrogance presuming to eclipse french style the original mon pere ce heros was one of the most charming films of so naturally the accountants in hollywood thought they could hire depardieu and phone the rest in they did however take the precaution of hiring francis veber to write an english version albeit one utilising virtually every word of the original depardieu brings his gallic charm and katherine heigl shows all the promise that is now paying off the thing is that when the french make a sort of lolita lite they get away with it because the dirty french postcard thinking works in their favour here the hollywood idea of lightweight subtlety is to have depardieu totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known he is actually her lover prevailed upon to play and song something french launch into a spirited version of thank heaven for little girls see the original 
i saw this dvd on sale and bought it without a second thought despite not even having known it was out since this is one of my favorite books of all time as soon as i got home i raced to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed while it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book the similarities end there the characters are changed ie finny seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas gene seems to be somewhat of a hillbilly scenes are misplaced or altogether changed ie lepper many characters are missing and famous lines thought are missing the movie does attempt to portray some feeling that the previous one lacked but it is done in a lackluster way that makes for a flat boring movie it is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book such a classic and this movie takes those things and utterly destroys them in its rewriting 
the affair is a very bad tv movie from the s starring the then husband wife team of robert wagner and natalie wood as hesitant lovers she has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer he s an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her their affair such as it is is doomed from the start and she knows it but goes along with it anyway two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this wood s jane fonda hairdo that is never mussed no matter what and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick she sings it for four or five or six minutes so you know it s classic padding between commercials it also is one of the worst songs ever written and the woman doing wood s singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery also keep an eye out for all the peasant tops and dresses by comparison wagner looks relatively timeless with close cropped hair and sporting a series of classic suits 
 lonely among us definitely is one of the best first season episodes the storyline although somewhat confusing creates a lot of suspense supported by the creepy synthesizer driven soundtrack this is a typically alien body invasion scenario but finally turning out to no evil purpose the death of assistant chief engineer singh to me was an accident the two delegate species deliver an entertaining frame best make up so far finally adding a little black humor to the series the final scene patrick stewart obviously enjoys stepping out a bit of his picard character and exploring some new terrain as does data by posing as sherlock holmes another all time classic the special effects are also convincing and director cliff bole did his job well he is the first one trying to compensate trois lack in acting ability by improving her looks she does look beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress improves her appearance a lot picard s lightning scene on the bridge gives him a slight air of the emperor of star wars return of the jedi which is a personal impression but made me smile there s also some playing with the lighting of the corridors simulating night aboard and the first moving camera pulling back from picard when he s entering the transporter room to beam into the cloud nice work the clever cutting creating continuing dialog through different scenes troi s hypnosis report rounds up the impression of a really well crafted tng episode the first one where even wesley crusher seemed almost tolerable the ending however is a bit confusing just as if the producers were running out of time p for picard is a little far fetched and his return far too easy but that can be left aside regarding the many strong moments this episode has to offer 
terrific production and a good comedic performance by george clooney can t save curiously detached occasionally clumsy quasi comedy from joel and ethan coen depression era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process the film meanders along but never builds any momentum it does get a big boost from clooney s charismatic gableesque mugging and also from the art direction and t bone burnett s lively music otherwise the screenplay by the coens is seriously lacking in humor and interest supporting cameos by john goodman and holly hunter fail to add any lift and the second half of the movie slides precariously into self indulgence from 
take your video camera turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you ve got the basic idea of what this film looks like it is very irritating to watch this kind of movie to be fair there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie i like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn t do a thing for me so sorry i really tried to like it there didn t seem to be much of a plot other than we ve got to find a way out of here didn t learn too much about any of the characters so it didn t matter if we lost one or two along the way this isn t the worst movie in the world open water holds that title for now 
this movie is juxtaposition of various super bad tough guy biker characters loosely connected but with no real storyline some of the scenes are nicely filmed if they took the same cast and crew and made a movie called the gent who was the coolest character in the film and came up with an interesting and continuous story maybe it could be decent as it is prepare for a lame series of tough guy character intros all of whom do nothing but ride bikes around the desert all day and cause trouble while all staying never getting sunburned and keeping their hair and clothes perfect and never needing to look for a home or money etc there was a sort of background story about the characters pasts various people that were killed and a treasure that was probably supposed to be the plot 
from the offset i knew this was going to be a terrific movie the pace the cinematography personalities indigenous to the dallas area the diversification of characters not to mention the director oliver stone and of course eric bogasian the film starts out on a friday suggestively occult in the first place and begins with a radio station in dallas that is hosting their number one talk show the barry champlain show based on the talk radio host alan berg barry eric bogasian is the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the radio audience feeding into his show he attempts to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have the masochistic craving to be publicly vilified barry champlain is effective in coping with this precarious ilk by socially debasing them rather than simply subjugating them to mere admonishment new technologies serve a stigmatic purpose for the dallas radio audience and paramount concepts take a backseat to perversion talk about baseball scores orgasms and people s pets the whole thing is a cacophony of drug induced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia this high profile cannon fodder is something that barry champlain thrives on the convoluted pathos the deranged proclivities deeriving from inaneities and puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for barry champlain s stilted battleground the setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology in the the center of dallas there is an overbearing sense of cosmopolitan awareness whereby miles away resides a significant chapter of the ku klux klan the play is based in denver that is where the actual story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of louisville atlanta and cleveland dallas is the city where the film takes place i thought it was an excellent choice this movie illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly misconceptualization of the jewish people in america whereby they control the banks their agenda is different than everybody else s and their intellectual literature leads to perversion these preconceived notions compound barry champlain s overall dilemma barry champlain s personal undoing is whereby he is irascible and non responsive to his alcoholism and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate undoing this is what makes the film so believable the characters in the movie were well portrayed dan the tailor made for middle management hatchet man played by alec baldwin who was constantly monitoring barry champlain s every move laura his girlfriend also his producer will constantly feel barry is someone who is always misunderstood ellen his ex wife is a recipient of barry s anguish and selfishness but cannot quite relinquish her feelings for barry regardless of the path of personal destruction he winds up resorting to the dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retro bates who are dementedly amused by their own real shortcomings in part everybody s hang ups including barry champlain s own hang ups are what do barry champlain in his audience ogles depravity solicits amelioration and ultimately becomes barry champlain s pet project for prescribed sinners social culture conflicts become barry champlain s downfall this movie is superb in my opinion oliver stone s best picture including platoon and natural born killers that statement in of itself tells you how magnificent a film talk radio is the story consulting and acting and co producing of eric bogosian is simply compelling the camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all top notch the cinematography of the dallas skyline at the end of the movie is terrific dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolis so now just like los angeles and new york there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost housing neighborhoods from hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next year dallas asserts it s status as a major metropolitan area in the precarious manner by which human debauchery prevails the city has it s lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin to the marvel of nationwide air wave communication these are the culprits in the movie the ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity has morally obliterated the last neighborhood in america 
they used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the gendercide of men the funny thing is you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background ok the plot some lady says there should be a society with no men and the crowd in front of her which contains some men think its a great idea so then all the men are killed or something so there are no more then this blonde scientist creates a man but removes some chromosomes so he can t be violent the male grows very quickly and soon is a full grown man not long after he takes the blonde s volkswagen beetle and drives into the city where he s discovered now you would think the lone man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever but no way the police chase him i didn t watch the rest but it probably ends up that they ve got to race against the clock and some people or something bad will probably happen somehow the man ends up in a stadium with some other men who want him to lead the rebellion these brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some sort of plan which laid out the details of how they d single handedly get rid of a planet full of women but i didn t watch and neither should you if you re up late and channel surfing and this happens to come on don t watch watch anything but this you ll find those ads for bowflex or the ones with women in bathing suits asking you to pick up the phone to meet women just like these in your area will be more satisfying entertainment oh yeah there s this funny thing when they re pulling in with their cars i don t know what they did it looks like they drove in real slow and careful but then tried to speed up the film to compensate but it just looks really weird the blonde girl was kind of cute and i m feeling generous so 
a big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film incredibly bad very pretentious it would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute we don t really learn anything about this character except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic we don t know why nicholas cage turns in an excellent performance as usual but i feel that this role and this script let him down and how after not being able to perform for the whole film can he have an erection on his deathbed really terrible and i felt like i needed a bath 
 tipping the velvet is one of the modern day television productions that prove that some television can be just as good or even better as this is than what you see at your local theater if you want to read the plot read this and if you want other details skip down to the next paragraph this is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional young girl named nan who works as a naive oyster girl until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named kitty who dresses as a male for her stage profession the young girl soon joins the act as another male impersonator and they are a major hit soon the both of them embark on a tender affair kitty eventually becomes enveloped in a marriage of convenience and ravages young nan s heart from then on nan works as male impersonated prostitute to men looking to have sex with boys then she becomes the private sex slave to the evil and sadomasochistic diana where nan experiences severe emotional abuse when that ends badly nan is on the streets again where she recalls a young woman named florence a good hearted socialist who had the true potential of being a wonderful partner that s where nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to get back to fame the region transfer is of exceptional picture quality there is a very good scene selection an eloquent photo gallery and a fun interview between novelist sara waters and the film s writer andrew davies the sets costumes cinematography and music are gorgeous the acting writing and directing are extremely strong and filled with realism class and originality i loved the film and the novel section iii in the film is much different in the film than in the novel because section iii in the novel is great written down but isn t screen material i will be brave and say that i love the films interpretation of it much more this breathtaking historical ingeniously combines drama comedy erotica and romance to vibrant perfection in a way that is both deeply moving and spiritually uplifting for every mature and open minded adult who has ever felt the pleasures pains and power of falling in love and living life to it s fullest a revolutionary production an absolute must see 
lotsa action cheesy love story unexpected actors and overall great fun the special effect are acceptable decent some of the fighting is kinda neat with some interesting acrobatic moves the overall story moves along and is cheesy enough to keep you wondering when the inevitable is going to happen although there is a bit of a twist just a small one the overall naivety of the movie make it quite whimsical at times cute enough chicks too what more could you want ps if you re gonna review a movie like this try to review it in terms of the category the movie would fall not necessarily where it was intended to fall ie don t bomb out good cheesy movies 
yes i felt like i had been gutted after first seeing it but not until the next day did i begin to see the true brilliance of this creation i won t repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film but there is one new area i want to touch on spoilers why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student s pocket most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatisfactory performance i must disagree watch the scene again huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage the student is quite an expressive girl crying vocalizing her fears just the opposite of huppert s character there is a scene later in the film after the girl is injured when huppert discusses the accident with the girl s mother the mother visibly upset states we gave up everything so she could study piano and huppert immediately snaps you mean she gave up everything don t you so it was my thought that huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny she didn t want the girl to end up like her repressed hardened condemned to a life of recitals gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago before things grew bad maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age is she ruining the student s life or simply freeing her for me that realization made all the difference in what i experienced through this film brilliant 
i watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears i guess i just was looking for some flashback to the wonderful series that i remembered i watched the mod squad television show religiously back in the day and it was fantastic it was action packed and the relationship the had with greer was endearing there wasn t any of that here when greer was murdered you get the idea that these could have cared less the actor who portrayed pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part like he was mentally challenged pete in the television series was quiet and serious but had a funny side also they had this guy acting like he was either on drugs on the time drunk or just plain ignorant i wouldn t recommend this movie at all especially if you were a fan of the tv series it will be a complete letdown 
oh dear what can i say about half past dead i was really disappointed in it i was thinking a steven seagal movie cool we ll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones we might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody excellent however i was in for a rude awakening this film can be summed up as follows take an episode of the a team remove the lovable and roguish characters such as murdoch hannibal mr t and face then get a writer director to pen a plot even ed wood would be ashamed of and who s too big a fan of the matrix and john woo movies for his own good throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who don t have real names finally add in a main star who s getting saggy around the midriff and doesn t appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore the result half past dead an action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through the plot holes are stupendously glaringly large for example prisoners who when the jail is invaded fight the invaders rather than attempting to escape or how about the prison itself which has an armoury that contains heavy machineguns and rocket propelled grenade launchers you also have a helicopter bearing a striking resemblance to a huey with some kind of video game machinegun mounted in the nose then there s seagal himself i like the guy he can fight he s even witty in a way that jean claude van damme will never be but all through the movie i kept hoping for that one great defining fight scene never happened instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole hell of a lot i mean when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a sub machinegun at them there isn t a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the corridor and into the target yet somehow they miss even the a team would cringe at this foolishness and then when it gets to any kind of one on one physical stuff we get treated to a shabby matrix rip off without the benefit of bullet time people getting kicked twenty feet through the air and sundry other ludicrous acrobatic nonsense c mon steven you re better than this your career can t be over say it ain t so this is instantly forgettable except i m forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review and if you watch it try to find it amusing in an a team kind of way but i doubt it ll be high on anyone s re watchable list out for justice this ain t more like out to lunch 
i was stunned by this film afterwards i didn t even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison for many it may be the worst of antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of wenders verbose confused transcendentalism it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders typical meandering hero s stream of consciousness so it doesn t produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema but for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things 
the chemistry between sally hawkins and elaine cassidy was incredible they were thoroughly convincing and genuinely likable in their roles imelda staunton played the conniving mrs sucksby brilliantly despite the fact that she was a dastardly opportunist she somehow managed to have you sympathizing with her in the end rupert evans played the slime ball gentleman with sheer charm and snark he was a scene stealer the story itself was very unique as was the manner in which it was told the victorian england setting featuring two lesbian lead characters was intriguing and delightful there were some fantastic and unexpected twists and turns that really kept the audience engaged in the story a wonderful cast and excellent story made this film superb 
oh my lord what were they thinking about with this one it not only is frantically unfunny but worse a very good original was trashed in the bargain jane fonda believe it or not actually turned in the performance of her life in that one even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life maybe she is just flat good as a crook any other time wow what a waste of time but she and segal team up beautifully so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from because very very very little of that one remains to this ones horror nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when dick and jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss and uhh oh my lord that s it well looks like it it truly is that bad a film 
totally forgettable and almost unwatchable if you enjoy bad acting thin plots and predictably weak outcomes pull up a chair of passing interest to see bridget fonda look a like suzy amis 
i was blubbing like an idiot during the last ten minutes of this exceptional piece of television i have to say that the idea of sitting down to view minutes of what was bound to be pretty depressing material on a sunday was not a welcome one the thought of yet another over worthy bafta winning possibility did not enthuse me however the end result knocked me for this is some of the best television i have seen in ages for years i was under the impression that all originality had left the bbc s drama department our friends in the north was the last production that truly blew me away and that was years ago however faith is restored and honour is satisfied david tenant was incredible so many actors i can think of would have really gone to town on a part like this but never once did i see mr tenant as an actor or as the doctor all i saw was alan hamilton i haven t had my heart wrenched this much since daniel craigs performance as geordie peacock all those years ago sarah parish was also incredible and i really hope this role brings her better roles in the future all of the cast were great but special mention must go to the director who really placed us inside alans head the toaster scene in particular made me feel quite queasy 
this movie embodies the soul of modern elite foodculture even though the movie is years old the standing principle in the movie is food is more than just nourishing matter it is also a powerful symbol and a medium for culture itself the main characters literally get drunk on the finest wine and food become inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture as they let go of their puritanism and passion denying table manners karen blixens shortstory makes use of the difference between north europe and south europe to point out their inherently different approaches to food as the strict and and rather dull scandinavians get infused with eros from south the party gets going so what are you waiting for go watch it again 
this is slightly less sickening than the first two films but otherwise it s business as usual a scuzzy sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema charles bronson is back blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood crime you see is up in the south belmont area so what s to be done a stronger police presence tougher jails harsher sentences nope the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like bronson to mete out bloodthirsty revenge or as the writers would have it justice this time he s the personal killing machine of police chief ed lauter the writers bend over backwards to make kersey the hero sending the useless cops into the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection and supplying a scene in which kersey has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back to applause from the watching crowd capital punishment for theft well okay the attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution and the dishonest twisting of the characters into ciphers who exist only to cheer kersey on or back him up is appalling sure these villains are scum but shouldn t the film leave the audience to make up its mind rather than slanting the entire thing towards kersey and his mindless answer funnily enough the beleaguered residents don t fear gang reprisals or blame kersey for any of the violence which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of kersey s involvement at the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and gleefully join in with the massacre never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being the atrociously shallow performances don t help bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and can t even put inflection on the right words new heights of stupidity are reached here a machine gun a rocket launcher and new lows of misogyny the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight whether by rape explosion or throat slashing and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion like one victim who ventures into the crime ridden gang controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger or another who goes shopping alone at night this is dreck pure and simple mindless garbage put together without style or sense 
this movie was not very well directed they almost totally disregarded the book i guess they were trying save time the only upside me was that the actor who played finny was cute some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book major parts of the book were once again chopped out you lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary also i was surprised not pleasantly by a new character that was no where in the book one of my favorite characters leper was poorly interpreted and portrayed he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book over all disappointing 
did uwe boll seriously just rip off the basic idea and dialogue from se en why is it so fekking difficult for this douchebag to be original he even mentioned in an interview with gametrailers that he chooses stuff like games to make into movies because the characters plots backstories and so on are already there and ready for him to screw with guess it isn t too much of a stretch for him to rip off another movie entirely i mean seriously what the hell here s something i made in uwe s honor http zuucka deviantart com art uwe boll is a douchebag 
over the gw is a near failure of a debut feature and not because it s not without trying actually it is it s a shamble all the more because it s writer director technical everyman nick gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film sometimes a first time filmmaker full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed unsure and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story the extremely personal side gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story gaglia who was when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their patients with crazy group scare tactics psychological mind f sessions that could go on for days and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most nazis cringe escaped finally when he was i m glad he got out though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his film making skills if only for a couple of days to learn things like say structure proper lighting fluid camera movement subtlety with actors and other basics that are perpetually lost here it s all the more frustrating because gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public there was recently a newsweek article referring to a similar aa cult rehab many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas this is an ever nagging sensation throughout over the gw where it almost feels like gaglia wants to tell the truth but doesn t know how to communicate it properly through his characters the character that one would think is closest to him bronx teen tony serra gallagher who is taken by his mother to a rehab in new jersey would be closest to gaglia is actually much more of a one dimensional being where there is very little back story we see a brief freak out in black and white in his old home and little connection to his mother moriarty who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another but there is a story to go with his two year crisis i guess right off the bat things get rough a nude cavity search in the first five minutes and soon it s clear that instead of medical care it s more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect where the head doctor hiller insinnia is a total over controlling loon but soon tony s sister sofia donohue gets thrown in to the program and as opposed to tony s repeated moments of outrage and supposed non compliance she goes head on through the whacked out three step program and once released becoming a runaway at times there are bits in this fractured nightmare where there s one woman a year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she s become a prisoner not allowed to leave and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to hiller when sofia finally returns to them that do contain some raw power very brief glimpses of gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodrama but these are moments few and far between it s not just the unsuccessful characters who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical d a r e rip offs maybe some of them like an angry black youth the passive aggressive counselors or even serra s older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them it s that gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through he over uses tints mostly with a shade that looks urine coated he jiggles his hand held dvx camera as if it s supposed to be intense ala city of god occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudo indie soft rockers and there s even inane fake interview scenes with nicholas serra inspiration and krakowsky that feel about as false as possible could gaglia just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to would be artistically cathartic plan b bottom line no matter how much from the heart true life stories may appeal to you don t bother seeing it in the theater or even on rental unless you love a final scene with two kids staring off into the digital hued hudson river sunset with the final words reading dedicated to the kids oy 
sorry to disagree with you but i found the dkc series to be quite engaging so much so that i invested in the snes system and my own copies of the games this is mind you almost ten years after the initial release of dkc the graphics were ground breaking for their time the first vector graphics games for home systems the music and characters are all memorable and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment true the second game was better than the first and the third was perhaps lacking the edge of the second installment but all three offered different play and i enjoy them to this day by the way i m old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever and tvs were black and white 
this movie although well shot and superbly acted was awful i felt as if i was watching a car accident sure i kept watching but i really wanted to turn my head the plot leaves little to be desired was extremely disjointed and the ending was abysmal although it did fit the tone of the movie i was hoping for something to improve this movie i still don t understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie fifteen minutes of plot that really didn t do much it s really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasted on such an awful awful story there s not much more to say about this movie save yourself the time and watch c span it ll be more uplifting 
this film is the one which you fall in love with alfred hitchcock shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time the most influential aspects about his films are sheer simplicity gripping drama the another best thing about hitchcock s films is a definite gripping end any thing said about the man who knew too much is less the cinematography acting dialogs camera works are magnificent in this movie the song que sera sera at the end shall remain in our memories for life time the film is so enjoyable from start to end that we never know when it ends rarely would hitchcock include humor in his films this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie this film is absolutely brilliant as good as vertigo 
i saw this film before two weeks it s kitsch boring and totally unintelligible for people that haven t read the original book there are many fact mistakes too actors plays rather poor you must laugh even in the sad moments it was a totally waste of time 
despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes this entry the fourth feels tired toshiharu ikeda who directed the superb mermaid legend and the seminal japanese splatter film evil dead trap shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise a miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot predictable stalking harassing assault and rape ensues the staple of roman porno is sex and sex mixed with violence both potentially exciting subjects to be sure but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh a masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening via condom is too little kink to late the series rain motif continues and the film s final scene brings relief 
the silent film masterpiece battleship potemkin was commissioned by the soviet government to celebrate the th anniversary of the uprising of and to establish the event as an heroic foreshadowing of the october revolution of ironically the film s director sergei eisenstein was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalistic approach to film art subsequently eisenstein s formalism and suspect politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on socialist realism influenced by the russian film theoretician lev kuleshov and through him by d w griffith s intolerance smuggled into russia in eisenstein constructed his films from a collision of rapidly edited images a montage of shots varied in length motion content lighting and camera angle without question the most memorable illustration of eisenstein s stylistic approach and probably the single most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history is the odessa steps sequence in potemkin in structure potemkin is a five reeler divided into five narrative parts an organization clearly derived from the five act arrangement of western drama in men and maggots eisenstein dramatizes the pre revolutionary oppression and discontent of the battleship s working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny even before the sailors and their upper class officers masters are visually introduced eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea onboard ship we witness crowded unsanitary conditions eisenstein emphasizes the sailors dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings harsh labor and most memorably the maggot infested meat intended for the evening s meal the ship s nearsighted physician is brought forward by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suitable to be served with the dark soup boiling like the sailors rage in accordance with marxist maxims the church also fails the men and we see one of them smashing a plate inscribed with words from the lord s prayer from two different camera angles in perhaps the first deliberate jump cut in cinema history identified by inter titles as drama on the quarterdeck and an appeal from the dead potemkin s second and third parts depict the actual mutiny and the onshore funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution vakulinchuk united by vakulinchuk s appeals to brotherhood the initial mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers a chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by eisenstein s editing techniques the officers quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed the ship s doctor is thrown overboard accompanied by dramatic crosscuts to the maggot ridden meat and his eyeglasses metonymically dangling in the rigging tragically vakolinchuk s death is the price paid for the revolt no omelet without breaking eggs and he is laid out with dignity on an odessa pier hundreds of ordinary odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge death to the oppressors shots of fists clenching and unclenching signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness the complex and unforgettable odessa steps sequence constitutes the film s fourth act it begins with uplifting music and a series of close ups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects parasol eyeglasses baby carriage suddenly as exclaims a title card in huge letters the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps here eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting cossacks below the mise en scene is framed by a statue of caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom symbolic metonyms for russia s oppressive institutions tsarist monarchy and the orthodox christian church punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children in the first a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the slaughter s first victims the boy is shot but the mother continues running until close ups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the son s fallen body being trampled by the crowd with a much slowed editing pace the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers shown only in a diagonal shadow line they summarily shoot her dead after this lull the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach the womb of mother russia as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage in a scene famously imitated in the untouchables the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom when the carriage reaches the bottom there is a cut to a cossack wielding a sword and a classic kuleshov effect suggests what we do not actually see the slaughtering of this pure and symbolic innocent the final series of shots in the odessa sequence is of three stone lions one in repose one sitting up and one roaring the editing animates them into a visual metaphor of the people s awakened rage somewhat anticlimactically the fifth act returns us to the battleship as the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await an encounter with other ships from the fleet they and the viewer expect retribution but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of comradeship eisenstein was rewriting history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years but that quibble aside battleship potemkin stands as one of the seminal works of the silent film era and it retains extraordinary cinematic power 
from hardly alien sounding lasers to an elementary school style shuttle crash nightbeast is better classified as a farcical mix of fake blood and bare chest the almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of cohesive or effective story the acting however is not nearly as beastly many of the young aspiring actors admirably showcase a hidden talent particularly don leifert and jamie zemarel who shed a well needed shard of light on this otherwise terrible film nightbeast would have never shown up on set had he known the terrible movie making talent of this small maryland town 
i bought this video on a throw out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award winning brit sex comedy i guess i should have read the finer print i rarely write a panning review but here goes these actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films this comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors the theatre going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations i repeat is the joke about trashing the actors other highly respectable on screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick can the reference to the austen classics pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility be anything else how much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars are we meant to simply take it as a lay down misere that all actors are gay and thus letting their on screen roleplay affect our lifestyles is accepting their private homosexual dealings in our faces too i m sorry but i don t think so i say no to this one 
this was the film that first indicated to me what a great actor martin sheen really is he modestly claims that charlie is a better actor charlie can t hold a candle to him i found it suspenseful and thoroughly enjoyed the intertwining of the love story with the main plot and i usually hate love stories there s a great plot twist at the end that struck me as being fully credible particularly in the early s time period and probably now also the final scene had me on the edge of my seat this film roundly illustrates that treachery is often doled out by those we trust while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect and finally that human compassion can be found where we least expect it irenerose
flawlessly directed written performed and filmed this quiet and unpretentious danish film is an example of cinema at its best and if a person exists who can watch babette s feast without being touched at a very fundamental level they are a person i do not care to know the story is quite simple in the s two elderly maiden ladies birgitte federspiel and bodil kjer reside in remote jutland where they have sacrificed their lives romantic possibilities and personal happiness in order to continue their long dead father s religious ministry to the small flock he served one of the women s youthful admirers sends to them a frenchwoman babette st phane audran whose husband and son have been killed in france and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate although they do not really require her services the sisters engage her as maid and cook and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined indeed the entire village admires and depends upon her one day however babette receives a letter she has won a lottery and is now by village standards a wealthy woman knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to france the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly french meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation the meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember but not for reasons that might be expected for babette s feast proves to be food for both body and soul and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her the film is extraordinary in every way meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them as the film progresses we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to god and their all too human frailties and the scenes in which babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful beautiful and incredibly memorable there have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of babette s feast which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul highly highly recommended gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
it is always difficult to bring a pages book down to a three hours film i read the book before and i found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible the qualities of the book haven t been lost the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in london in the s the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud is brought up the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking the unexpected and surprising twists of the story the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from sue s point of view then from maud s one the main actors do very good and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other because they still love each other for each of her books the author sarah waters has thoroughly investigated what life was like in british th century while in tipping the velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements in affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits in fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research this is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth i highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere vivid emotions and suspense 
maybe it was the fact that i saw spider man the day before i saw duces wild but i do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was the cast was there to do it but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie the only problem was that they did not fit i did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best i left wondering why i spent my money on this movie 
seriously folks i was getting ready to actually write the razzie council and recommend this movie as razzie champ for until i got on imdb com and realized its copyright date was and not seriously though this movie could have easily been a razzie champ this movie sucked how in the world this piece of crap was overlooked even for a razzie nomination in is beyond me because it easily could have competed with basically it stinks too for the razzie championship i rented this movie on the recommendation of a female neighbor of mine who told me oh my god after seeing this movie it s going to be a long long time before i ever stop at a rest stop ever again i couldn t believe how not scary and awful this movie was possible spoilers below not that you ll be missing out on anything ok first of all the problem the rest stop itself obviously the director of this piece of crap doesn t know the first thing about women the toilets in that rest stop were on the same level as the one in the movie trainspotting i don t claim to know everything there is to know about women but one thing i do know is that women for the most part are total and complete hygiene neat freaks given the choice between taking a crap on either of those toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the woods a woman is going to opt for squatting in the woods i know because i ve gone camping with them before and they have no problem squatting in the woods so right there major plot hole and untruth second of all she comes out of the rest stop and her boyfriend who drove the car is nowhere to be found not him nor his car he just left she starts screaming his name wondering where he is ummm hello you re standing on wet mud did it ever occur to you to look down for some tire tracks i mean his car is gone it didn t just get up and fly away and actually that makes me think i actually was looking down at her feet and there weren t any tread marks in the mud how exactly did that happen third the bible thumping mobile home family with the freak midget in the back taking polaroid pictures wtf they made absolutely no sense at all and it s as if the director just threw them in to be weird for the sake of being weird they made no sense at all and had no place even being in the movie fourth oh my god this i mean finally near the end of the movie she finally sees the escape hatch on the ceiling inside the rest stop i m like you dumb bi h you ve been locked up in this rest stop for all this time and you just now see the escape hatch on the ceiling i mean it s like they threw that in just because the killer tossed gasoline on the floor through the window and was getting ready to light a match so she needs to get to higher ground to avoid being burned and oh look a perfect reason for her to get to higher ground an escape hatch on the ceiling it s like why didn t she go through that before most people in that situation would have seen that from the moment they were locked in that rest stop and gotten the f k out of dodge when they showed that escape hatch at the end of the movie i was like you have got to be kidding me fifth what was the deal with all the of people she encountered continuing to just disappear the girl in the broom closet in the rest stop the dumb cop her at the end of the movie when she ended up in the broom closet herself it was never explained personally when they did this i thought to myself oh christ on a cracker it s her she s the killer wonderful she killed all of those people doesn t remember doing it and the writers of this movie just ripped off a certain french horror flick that i can t mention on imdb com or i ll be blacklisted for giving away the ending that movie sucked by the way too people but it wasn t she wasn t the killer and the whole deal with the dead people disappearing was never ever explained oh for the love of god people stay away from this movie this movie sucked balls and i have now got a serious bone to pick with my neighbor it s on the for rack at family video don t even rent it if someone gives it to you for free 
two redeeming qualities of this film were the cinemaphotography and a storyline that was hard to resist however the script the direction and some scenes were just awful i kept asking myself why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie my only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity which underlies the plot of the movie but knew the movie was filled with flaws this film could have been so much better and reached a larger audience accordingly what makes me think this is that with all of the problems of the film some scenes being painfully bad to watch i still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would resolve itself 
i found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible i knew some of he facts about caravagggio but here they were twisted and puzzling the images were weirdly interesting but i was looking more for a biographical and or critical accounting of caravaggio s life and works not an lsd type drug trip the dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains calculators typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting had it been labelled an artsy film i wouldn t have purchased the dvd now i have a dvd that i ll never watch again and who would buy it i prefer mainstream films not those that require translation or elucidation thumbs down on this one for me 
interesting premise interestingly worked out the strongest feature of this film is the emotional tension of the astronaut who knows a truth but is unable to convey it to others overlook the weaknesses and just enjoy the movie but be prepared for a certain level of suspense 
this is an excellent anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of ufo or space first series of course it isn t some sfx extravaganza or star wars pseudo mystic tripe fest but a subtle movie that has a slow pace yet it conveys the creepy eerie and uncanny atmosphere of the best anderson productions for lovers of cerebral sci fi lynn loring s voice is absolutely awful sfx are good for this kind of product and acting is good as well two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home instead or do they ah videophones every now and then peddled as the next everyone s gadget next decade but still to happen years later the device of earth s twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera tai daiakuju giron so who copied whom 
 western union is something of a forgotten classic western perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on dvd in the united states however all is not lost as it has now appeared on region in england this being a blessing in some ways is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely american organization as the western union telegraph company is without a region release it beggars belief it simply doesn t make sense produced by fox in western union was directed by fritz lang this was only the second occasion the great german director undertook to direct a western he had done an excellent job the year before with fox s the return of frank james and would have only one more western outing in with the splendid rancho notorious lang was no ford or hawks but with western union he turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well beautifully photographed in early three strip technicolor by edward cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by robert young randolph scott and dean jagger the female lead is taken by virginia gilmore who really has little to do in the picture an actress who never made anything of her career her presence here is merely cosmetic it is curious that robert young has top billing over scott it is clearly scott s picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film s terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains young doesn t have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western he just looks plain silly going up against barton mclane in a gunfight an actor who never really distinguished himself except perhaps with crossfire young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with his greatest success when for seven years he was tv s marcus welby md in the seventies he died in at the age of western union recounts the connection by telegraph wire of omaha and salt lake city scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by western union boss dean jagger to protect the line from marauding sioux and to also take on mclane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends robert young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with scott for the affections of miss gilmore some comic relief is provided by and irritatingly so some would say by slim summerville and john carradine turns up in a meager role as the company doctor altogether though a spanking good western albeit on region but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with my only crib is that there are no extras not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics ugh footnote interestingly the associate producer on western union was harry joe brown who later with randolph scott would create a partnership that would produce some of scott s finest westerns in the fifties 
wow i think they made this movie to torture people there are no words for how much i hated this film i could have been cleaning my room instead i love bad melodrama as much as the next person but come on 
babette s feast for me is about healing mending the schism between spirit and body in orthodox christianity this puritanical community in remote denmark is missing an adequate appreciation of all of god s gifts in creation they have taken the dualism of st paul to an extreme and stress the life of the spirit not the life of the flesh both elderly sisters in their youth were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village they and their parishioners cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and the sisters father the aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome and the sisters don t know what to do enter babette a french stranger and someone to whom they can show kindness they have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry dusty theology babette will give everything she has and in the process will teach the sisters and their flock about grace about sacrifice about how sensual experience as in the bread and wine of the eucharist can change lives and about why true art moves us so deeply when they can forgive each other and themselves they can focus on god s love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present as a minister and an artist i can t recommend a movie more highly true art and true grace 
i have never been a great fan of oliver stone often because i have found his films to be forced preachy and generally flawed the two stone films i truly like are jfk and talk radio yet talk radio takes the cake for being stone s finest achievement stone is a director whereby you are either a fan or you are not it is safe to say that before watching talk radio i was not fond of the guy and considered one of the most overrated directors in the film industry though after watching talk radio some of my perceptions have changed talk radio is an unsettling and amusing attack on what is now known as reality tv talk radio follows a self indulgent dysfunctional determined hysterical outrageous and perplexing radio host named barry champlain who hosts a controversial late night radio show in dallas quickly becoming well known for his bold and quirky air presence he becomes a late night sensation whereby depraved junkies delinquents racists sociopaths sickos perverts and morons call in to be ridiculed on air the film shows the rise and fall of the man s career carefully making an accurate portrayal on freedom of speech originally adapted from a stage play the film attaches itself to the theatre theme that it was originally built around wonderfully conveying the film s fierce nature with the ferocious energy and non stereotypical air talk radio brings all the hilarity behind crass media it remains even more poignant today than it was in the late s the film goes into depth studying the likes of arrogance self obsession offensive behaviour controversy hypocrisy and ignorance the film shows through a controlled manner how it is good to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech yet it is something that should be used wisely rather than shamefully blunt stone tries to show how freedom of speech is a crucial importance in life but is something that we should be wary and cautious about the film asks the question of is our main protagonist just the same as the sad people who call up the show stone fabulously creates the film s key set piece the radio station with an ambition and cold atmosphere he then succeeds in capturing the isolation fear ambiguity and the dangerous emotions that are built up at the radio station eric bogosian is perfectly cast as the isolated self absorbed and complex genius barry champlain he fits the role perfectly letting off his lines with such enthusiasm urgency perplexity brusqueness and ultimately the bold hilarity of his offensive nature the performance brims with spark which was evidently robbed of an oscar nomination his voice suits the character being that a primary element of a radio host and his power of acting along with tragedy and comedy works brilliantly there is a strong use of editing in stone s films and talk radio boasts some of his cleanest most rhythmic editing he uses beautifully controlled camera techniques which differ from being calm to suddenly becoming turbulent there is a vibrant energy behind the film with its raw and wonderfully delightful script working as a centre piece for the greatness of the film the striking and virtuous cinematography stands out in the moments inside and outside the studio most impressively capturing the city at night not forgetting the hauntingly heartbreaking and yet darkly funny climatic spiral to decline is ultimately remarkable cinema talk radio is an essential modern masterpiece i am certain you will be surprised by just how great it really is i highly recommend talk radio for anyone interested in media or film talk radio is a fine example of top notch intellectual and insightful entertainment which still packs a well earned wakeup call finally if it was not for eric bogosian the film would not be the fun delightful and enduring masterpiece it is today 
i chose this movie really for my husband who works in radio broadcasting i thought that it would be more of a movie that he would enjoy and relate too though it was from the eighties so it was a little dated this movie really draws you in at times you just want to strangle the host barry at times you just want to send some of the bigots who call in to a true concentration camp at times you really feel sorry for barry because he has truly gotten too big for his jeans if you know what i mean it was on the drama channel on encore so i am thinking this is a true story if you truly love dramas you will love this even if you don t know all the ins and outs of the broadcasting business if you are an alec baldwin fan and are watching it to see him you shouldn t his part is really a bit part in this movie 
as a professional poker dealer for over years i found this movie very hard to watch too unreal it seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn t care the card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game common sense right plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks who couldn t do that the cheating was amateur stuff palming marked cards etc would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards would you sit in a game where the players push their chips into the middle of a pot constantly mixing them in then just verbalizing how much they bet c mon i gave it a because the twists and turns might be interesting to some people but for those who know how to play the game it will be pretty painful next time they should use real players and get some insight on how to do it right ouch 
the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant them it in the hope that given a little time they ll convince you it s possible alas with tv movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience not here though the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately it s not enough to save the day oh and the less said about the ending the better happy film viewing everyone 
this movie is astonishingly poor it was on television when i tuned in during an action scene and was chuckling away at the cheesy macho dialogue waiting for leslie nielsen to appear it took me a couple of minutes to realise that it wasn t actually a comedy it was meant to be taken seriously what has to be remembered is that somebody actually sat down and wrote this movie and worse still other people funded it and gave it the green light rutger hauer obviously doesn t read movie scripts before he signs up either that or he has some seriously bad debts to pay strangely this film is so poor that you find yourself staring at it wondering how it actually got funded and how a tv channel must have paid money for the rights to air it the dialogue between hero and baddie whilst trying to shoot each other out of the sky is particularly painful with dialogue sounding like it was generated by a texas intruments speak spell the hollywood money machine at it s worst funny though 
an obsessive love story where the characters have been extremely convincing i think this film highlights the talent of professional actors specially for vincent cassel who wouldn t at the time it was filmed be the first character you think of for such a role and yes he did succeed to seduce the beautiful monica belluci beyond the film during this creation i can only say that this film should have been released at it is in the usa instead of thinking of doing a remake it is simply so french almost perverted and yet so true this film should stay untouched a director that should definitely get more projects as this kind of subject requires the right amount of ingredients to not make it a flop 
for late s cheese this really isn t so bad there are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one liners that was grand theft thanks and madonna gives a fine performance nothing award worthy here but that goes for razzies as well as oscars i m curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular pre british influenced speaking voice rather than the hyper bronxy accent used instead oh well as a side note i got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played buck the ups delivery guy died about a year after who s that girl
i watched this movie recently and fell in love with it i loved the storyline and the actors it has a little of everything i was completely taken by the unfolding of the story it has so many surprises along the way i highly recommend it in fact i loved it so much that i ran out and bought the book i felt i had to read it in order to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie i also wanted to make sure i didn t miss anything that was in the book but kept out of the movie i recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is enough difference in the book especially in the second episode to want to read it it has become my favorite movie i am now a sarah waters and elaine cassidy fan 
the plot of this movie is as dumb as a bag of hair jimmy smit plays a character that could have been upset by the ridiculousness of the story he is evil and a wife beater it s a character as far from his nypd and la law roles as you could possibly get if you ve thought he had the looks and the acting chops to play the really bad boy role her s your present but mary louis parker wears black miniskirts and little black minidresses throughout the movie she has always had some of the greatest legs in the history of the movies this makes the movie well worth it for this leg admirer i d buy the dvd for this reason only if it was available 
i m a huge space buff and at nearly i ve just discovered this flick for the first time i came at it in a roundabout way from space then ufo i went hunting for other anderson creations and found this was their first live action work what a home run i actually heard about this movie many years ago but never knew what it was called so i m happy to have found it by accident these andersons were nothing short of amazing in their writing the execution of the completely believable and realistic looking models the quality of acting etc i don t think it looks dated at all let me tell you i ll take good old models over the fake looking cgi crap of today any time seriously most of the rocket scenes looked pretty real they had it down to a science if you choose to think of what you are looking at as real it isn t hard to actually believe it also the amount of detail in set designs the beautiful photography the whole look man i wish i could go back to that time they knew how to make great movies in the s personally i ve lost all interest in hollywood movies today anybody with a budget can do cgi i hate it bring back the models think of all the people that style employed anyway i am ranting if you like good sci fi that s very well done you will do yourself a service by watching this 
first i must confess that a separate peace is my favorite book so of course i have some bias against any attempt at adapting it for a feature film or television movie but as i began to watch this film i was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt the original version from the early s though shot at phillips exeter academy where the book s author attended school and though it stayed as faithful as it could to the book lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the essence of the characters the original seemed to simply go through the motions reading the trivia about the movie you discover that it was cast mostly with non actors thus the original has an amateurish feel to it and it ultimately fails this new version though i will grant that it captures the look of the period better than the original seems to have thrown the book out all together scenes are rearranged characters imposed where they don t belong characters created that were not in the book and no attempt was made to delve into the deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling and the cardinal sin of all the tree is not treated as the vital almost central character it is in the book this is an inexcusable oversight on the part of the film makers how could they downplay the role of the tree why was it not introduced immediately why the dead poet esque beginning and what in god s name was up with gene s accent this film is to be blunt garbage a separate peace should not be a difficult book to adapt for the stage or screen john knowles wrote it in a perfectly fine linear style the film makers should have trusted the story as it was already written make changes sure embellish here and there sure take some mild dramatic license sure but destroy one of the pearls of american literature in the process what were they thinking in their corruption of the story line they cut any possibility of suspense or drama the whole movie falls flat and fails miserably if you are a high school or college student assigned to read this book and you are thinking of skimping and just watching the movie don t even think about it this film will be of no help to you alas we shall have to wait even longer before a version of this story comes to the screen that truly does it justice 
cruddy innocent no smoking drinking or bikers but jeremy slate good actor and jocelyn lane good actress make this moronically feasible for a bad biker flick post biker exploit time they knew it we knew it adam roarke and slate are wasted but they lived on a out of best performance jocelyn lane lane is the only really to catch the final exploit biker film after run angel run which also has good actors like don stroud etc it was over they knew it they were trying to make a living but jocelyn lane from two elvis bad flicks tickle me and something bad one in yellow and leather is the modern hot chick with j slate fighting for honor it s worth seeing but it sucks but check it out well worth non biker non smoker non boozing biker types with hot chicks 
another asian horror movie packed with intense and creepy moments another asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot which is here as well major spoiler warning the movie starts pretty simple two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself the sisters seem very hostile towards their mother especially the elder one and they seem to ignore their father all goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father then it hits you your sister has been dead for years now it turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didn t know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well as for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister revealed when the stepmother actually the sister s alter ego is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in i hope it has been made clearer for confused asian horror fans out there finally my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack very creepy out of 
i ve spent a year deployed in iraq and amongst the hundreds of movies i ve seen here was this little gem called vampire assassin judging from the cover african american with corn rows with a curved blade leather coat and the demeanor of a badass i expected a blade rip off fair enough so i pop it in and observed a borderlined overweight african american with no blade no cornrows and well nothing at all really except i don t know if you ve read any of these other reviews you get the gist of the flick it sucks bad really bad i don t know if it was the highlander esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire or the karate kick sound effects for camera zooms or the twenty dollar budget on props or the ok we have minutes to film this before we re caught filming in a johnson johnson parking lot or the martial arts that is as exciting and fast paced as two old people having sex or the th grade acting talent or the eccentric asian master who s either senial or on acid or what but the movie manages to force you to question your existence and that s awesome not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like scanners if you heckle or mst k with your friends this is the flick for you i ve seen it three times already and i think it might ve caused permanent damage on my psyche if you still don t have any clue as to the quality of the film people were trying to give it away for free and no one would take it not even by force long story short watch it either as masochistic pleasure or punishment it will rock your skull and for the most part for all the wrong reasons 
i don t see why everyone is bombing this so much i thought it was a great fun time that sadly wasn t popular enough to be that famous believe me i have seen much much worse than this if you want a bad movie see blood shack or the alien dead or something so what this is normal slasher fare but better than most and it is watchable this movie also has one of the best soundtracks i ve heard some of the music is very suspenseful and the death scenes are cool too we see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words sold written in blood on the mirror and we also get a cool double beating by a toilet plunger with razors attached to it this was a good fun s slasher that s definitely worth your time despite what others say about it 
this is a pretty silly film including what may well be the least erotic come on ever to make it to the big screen the heroine pours v all over herself and invites the hero to lick it off yuck and yet it also features the resplendent lucinda dickey in what is far and away her most erotic performance in those long ago days women even action heroines with real muscles were a rarity and i can still remember the way my jaw dropped when dickey took off her shirt revealing the most powerfully built female back and biceps i d ever seen dickey s beauty and vitality carry the film she could have been a female schwarzenegger if anybody had had the vision to promote her 
the film tells upon the title role danton gerard depardieu confronting against robespierre wojciech pszoniak during the french revolution the film is based on real deeds they are the following danton as lawyer participated in the overthrowing of the king louis xvi and the proclamation of the republic being minister of justice in the convention and founder of cordeliers club he proposed creation revolutionaries committees as the committee of public salvation which he presided but was substituted by robespierre starting a period of revolutionary dictatorship known the terror besides in the film appear other historic personages as camille desmoulins patrice chereau now a famed filmmaker louis david saint just jacobino tallien the picture especially narrates the happenings surrounding the facing off of the principal figures one time partner revolution and posterior execution although gives results a contemporary parable about the modern poland thus danton is lech walesa and robespierre is wojciech jaruzelski who was the prime minister imposed the martial law in poland and with similar name than actor played robespierre gerard depardieu is excellent in the title character and magnificently portrayed also in secondaries roles are awesome actors as the recently deceased jacques villeret dinner game crimen in paradise and angela winkler the tin drum the motion picture is well directed by andrzej wajda considered the best polish director the flick will like to historical cinema buffs 
i saw this on a screener dvd a couple months before it was released i liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing the sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from freaks geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home definitely not what the dvd cover claims destined to be the next stoner classic hardly wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes there are some really pretty girls in this always nice to see a good looking cast almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on sound design was a bit poor i think less would have been best 
naturally along with everyone else i was primed to expect a lot of hollywood fantasy revisionism in they died with their boots on over the legend of custer just having someone like errol flynn play custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production and for the most part my expectations were fulfilled in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way yet even in this obviously biased and much criticized retelling of the custer story i was struck by some of the points made in this movie that sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly seemed to counter the typical clich s of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in westerns of the early th century for instance even while this film attempted to whitewash it s hero certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real life custer his initial entrance at the west point front gate in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character his miserable record at west point which seems to be attributed as much to custer s cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor there are moments in the way flynn plays custer at west point where he seems downright stupid custer s promotion to general is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake but it plays out as slapstick comedy i half expected to see the marx brothers or abbott and costello wander into the scene custer s stand against jeb stuart at gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky custer s drinking problem is certainly not ignored and although the music and some of the ways the indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the black hills squarely at the foot of the white man in fact no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not anthony quinn as sitting bull but arthur kennedy co as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the black hills sure that part of the story is true but i didn t expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this and one other thing usually in these films it is the indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol in this movie it is actually the troops of the th cavalry and not the indians who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way all in all this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the hollywood bunk 
i didn t know what to expect from this i always considered bam margera and the cky crew a team of knuckle heads devoted to to doing stupid things for entertainment i didn t know that they could act but everyone who acted in this movie pulled off good performances the hilarity of the aaaaagh scene mixes in with ryan dunn s depression and his revenge against his ex girlfriend perfectly at times the movie some scenes seem pointless but at the same time they re funny i recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh but this film may not appeal to those that prefer detailed story lines and a series of twists and turns 
this is absolutely the best s cartoon ever maybe the best cartoon of all time it had everything action adventure thrill and much more i can t imagine how hard it was for ruby spears company to make this great cartoon there has been spent a lot of money for this masterpiece of work and it was worth it for example just the beaming down scenes were hard because i wouldn t call the s for a great technology year with computers like now in the world we live in so the beaming down scenes were excellent the cartoons will never be the same as they were before that is why i hope that they all will be released on dvd specially the centurions as it s my favorite i have the whole complete set of episodes on dvd r but it s not the same because if they were released on dvd the people in the world would be able to buy it and see the dvd s in almost every store which means a lot to the fans my good friend ted made this petition to either get the show back on tv or better on dvd that is if we get many requests to get them back on dvd so please help us by signing the petition at http www petitiononline com f petition html
i m a huge fan of both emily watson breaking the waves and tom wilkinson normal and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett dellamorte dellamore in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid infinitely entitled worthless son of a rich lord are spot on and entertaining but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone the music was annoyingly movie of the week quality and the voice over jarring and totally unnecessary clearly the work of a first time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn t sufficiently heed good advice too bad i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end and vice versa so there is some sort of character arc at least in terms of perception for example watson s character while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man began to grate on me near the end particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat with no asking of permission no apologies offered and i went from disliking wilkinson s control freak moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change unlike his wife this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a love story or steel magnolias illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed was it the lord driving the car the lord s dog the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for florence nightingale incarnate etc was ok until he started over the top sobbing like a baby good god if you ask me she s just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands and so she drives her hard working well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach look everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary who seemed to appreciate him for who he was instead he acted like an abused dog his open craving for his wife s affection increasing with every kick she gives him i m not anti pc or anything it just didn t ring true even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face the ending for me was and not the director s intention i am certain depressing the movie spent the last minutes convincing me that these two people just don t belong together so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing i m not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed is that asking too much my score 
quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film if you are interested in film history to truly understand the innovations eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing potemkin along side most any film made before it those of d w griffith offer a good contrast it should be allowed that eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time however even today few directors have approached the skill with which eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium if you are not interested in that sort of thing potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made you should see it buy it and tatoo it to your chest 
as you can read the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually watch it at his church anyway movie had a good b movie sci fi beginning everything was there to make a good entertaining easy to watch movie then everything felt in this religious jesus will save everyone brainwashing mode story start with main characters reporters but it fast give the first role to that jesus freak who is there to save everyone s soul with this con descendant attitude in a few words this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about minutes waste of time waste of money avoid it
wow there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is i usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad but this was just too much i would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device if you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror if your thinking about watching this because your a sandra bullock fan don t even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time and her acting is absolutely atrocious not to mention the rest of the cast which could be replaced with baboons who would do a better job at least then we wouldn t have to listen to the terrible dialogue 
as horror films go rest stop could have been better in many levels director writer john shiban shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it unfortunately either he was not sure as to what to do with the material or maybe he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended either by the studio or the backers several endings have been included in the dvd but unfortunately the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best the idea of a psycho roaming the back roads of a remote part of california presents many possibilities at first after the disappearance of jess in the spooky rest stop things get out of hand poor nicole is left alone to fend for herself all the weirdos she finds along the way it was clear when one started to hear amazing grace in the background that there were forces trying to avenge the ways in which nicole an jess desecrate their neck of the woods by engaging in careless sex that is not well appreciated by the natives watch it at your own risk there s a lot of gore for the aficionados of the genre 
two years after this movie was made the juror came out don t waste your time on this one see the juror instead the juror is essentially the same story as trial by jury with better acting better directing and a far more gripping aura about it william hurt was not believable as a cop gone bad and armand assante couldn t be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit you didn t become involved enough with joann whalley s character to be that upset by what was happening to her also the way in which she interacted with the jury wasn t compelling or interesting in any way kathleen quinlan s role as a hooker killer wasn t fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot 
probably one of his lesser known films it suffers from the same lack of exposure as salvador in that its actually one of his best written by and starring eric bogosian talk radio tells the story of an opinionated radio phone in host who upsets the wrong kind of listener the film is important and has much to say on the issues of free speech and just how free it should be and you can easily tell that it started life as a stage play know what you re getting into before you sit down to watch it and you ll be fine there isn t much to the acting really as bogosian pretty much steals the film he wrote and is given licence to rant i couldn t take my eyes off him and that was part of the fascination many of the listeners had the people who hated him wouldn t turn off in case they missed something not for everyone but a very good drama and overall a very good film 
i really like this movie i like it not just because it s a great early s movie with a great soundtrack but i found that it has some thought provoking moments they are just moments not the entire film it s definitely not like less than zero the scenes deal with typical peer pressure and also with more difficult problems like the betrayal of trust these problems are not easily resolved or forgotten by the characters certain scenes will stand out and invite reflection on one s own teenage experiences and how those experiences may have affected one s character and outlook as an adult you can watch this movie and think about the problems young adults must face and about your own experiences or you can just pay attention to the boys quest to de virginize themselves either way it s a good movie 
 s goldeneye is one of the best n releases ever better than this game well star wars rogue squadron star wars episode i racer and the legend of zelda ocarina of time are far better and superior games but i still love goldeneye this is the best adaptation from a movie second only to star wars adaptations the story is perfect it s like you are in the movie itself the graphics are excellent the movements are extremely realistic the enemies artificial intelligence are the best part in this game i loved playing the stage in which james and natalya break from the janus base as the goldeneye prepares to burn it escaping without sounding an alarm was very difficult eluding cameras and controlling your fire are great aspects in the gameplay it s also the toughest game i ve ever played n games are usually very very easy goldeneye is the one exception i m still trying to beat the agent difficult level but winning the easier levels was already a great victory i loved when alec trevelyan asked for england james i answered no for me it happened just in the moment i blasted him to death just like in the movie i love accomplishing every objective the multiplayer gaming is even better at first i got killed every holy second now i know how to win i love forcing my playmates by playing at license to kill the music and sound are astounding super mario looks like an atari next to this the only thing i still wanted to hear was the goldeneye theme song that plays at the end of the movie after zelda was released i nearly forgot i still had this game it s still excellent even if it s already surpassed i hope other games are produced fantastic job rareware nintendo was very smart to release this game on the n exclusively magnificent job nintendo 
i must say i m an avid horror movie fan and currently i can t get enough of foreign horror since us horror really depends too much on gore this movie is fantastic this movie reminded me a lot of m night s sixth sense the way the film was directed was great the director took his time to set everything up it took about a good mins just to set the movie up into a horror movie i thought the movie was just a drama this movie just builds up and the pay off isn t too much i ve never done this before but this is the main reason i liked the movie i actually screamed out loud because one scene just startled the hell out of me which is kinda pathetic but for a film to do that it s great 
when you think oliver stone the movies that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial ones like platoon jfk born on the fourth of july or natural born killers talk radio usually doesn t it s a pretty small movie actually more than half the movie takes place with barry champlain at his radio station talking into his mike but believe me this is one of oliver stone s greatest movies and should not be missed above all things it s a character study barry champlain is a rude self destructive risk taking talk radio show host who says one too many things and starts to get in trouble with his boss his lover s his fans and even some nazis he doesn t like his audience and callers and a lot of them don t like him eithor that or do like him but have no idea why but at the end he says on his show i guess we re stuck with each other see talk radio even if you don t like oliver stone movies you might be surprised i sure was my rating 
spoilers this movie has it s problems but in the end it gets the message across i liked it because it ends the way things really do the nice guy tries and tries gets his heart broken several times but in the end there is no typical hollywood ending it ends the way such things always end or at least always have in my own and friends experiences anyone who thinks that the ending to this isn t how it really happens as the first comment seemed to believing that the girl would come around realize she s dating an asshole who treats her bad because he doesn t care about her at all is either naive or lives in a more perfect world than i i give it extra points simply because it wasn t afraid to end on a down note give no real resolution just the main character left heartbroken confused and alone as so many men of countless generations have been before 
this crock of doodoo won a award they must have been desperate for giving out an award for something this movie reeks of teeny bopper stuff and it made me sick thankfully i watched it alongside mst k s mike and the bots so it made it bearable horrid acting unsettling mother daughter moment silly premise if you want a bad movie here it is be warned though watch it with mike and the bots or you will suffer out of i still can t believe it won an award and the director is defending this ^ ^ piece of ^ ^ ^ movie 
i have certainly not seen all of jean rollin s films but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests which if you like that sort of thing is not bad but this is a major departure and could almost be cronenberg minus the bio mechanical nightmarish stuff except it s in french with subtitles of course a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up while in the background yet another woman lingers wearing nothing as they drive along it s obvious that there is something not right about the woman in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen still though that doesn t prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris his apartment the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this tower block a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower where others of her kind for whom the no memory things seems to be the least of their problems are being held for some reason time and events march by in the movie which involve mostly trying to find what s going on and get out of the building for this woman and she does manage to call robert the guy that picked her up in the first place to come rescue her the revelation as to what s going on comes in the last few moments of the movie which has a rather strange yet touching end to it in avoiding what seemed to be his typical formula rollin created in this what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film i like this one a lot check it out out of 
distributor goodtimes home video plot a pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for tv movie gail osborne is new in town she makes friends has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way that is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting after more and more phone calls she is raped throughout most of the movie she tries to find proof that the person did rape her audio video this vhs edition from goodtimes stinks there are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen extras no extras from goodtimes home video final thoughts this suspense filled made for tv movie was made in so don t expect many deaths there are none if you can find this movie with the worldvision home video logo on the front then buy it but the goodtimes version is pretty crappy this can be a little boring but if you are patient the ending is pretty good 
i ll have to admit that i m at a disadvantage here when i learn more about a film from other reviewers than from watching it myself then that s a problem although the plot of the man who knew too much seems generally straightforward the movie allows too many cryptic elements to get in the way of what could have been a satisfying mystery by the time we get to the scene where a witchy looking woman establishes the secrecy of the first degree of the seven fold ray i didn t know whether to laugh or rewind to see if i missed something in retrospect the cryptic note retrieved by mr lawrence leslie banks from the handle of a shaving brush was a craftily written message leading to a dentist named barbor and eventually to the albert hall a place not a person as indicated by a hall but for all the intrigue it s never made clear why the assassination target was being eliminated okay so louis bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to assassinate a diplomat named ropa but why was ropa a target come to think of it why was the note even written and secured in the shaving brush did bernard have to refer to it every now and then to remind himself what was going to happen with it s disjointed scenes the man who knew too much is hard to follow and a bit disorienting however i ll give alfred hitchcock credit for this early effort for perspective i ll have to watch some of his other work of the same era though this movie certainly can t hold a candle to his later works like psycho or north by northwest 
the combination of amazing special effects and oscar worthy acting makes the vindicator one of the most important sci fi films of recent years for some reason still unknown to me this gem was found in a bargain bin why some worthless human thought it right to dirty a modern classic by relagating to a bargain bin is beyond me i have never been so terrified by a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire forget terminator robocop aliens and other films that blaintly ripped off this masterpiece the vindicator is an unstoppable force 
i loved this movie you can t buy it rent it or find it but it s a keeper wonderful chemistry between braccho and walken and ferrar terrific non stop action and reactions loved it i ve watched my pirated copy maybe times in the last decade each time showing it to someone who never heard of it find this movie and watch it so many films are on tv over and over again without any of the wit and style of this little film i didn t know it was made for tv my copy is an track i pirated years ago i hope it lasts 
errol flynn at his best as robin hood of the west fighting military red tape confederates indians and carpetbagger business crooks singlehanded to his great and final heroic end not to forget the ever reliable o de havilland as lady mary of the west never try to link this story to the facts and the real persons it doesn t work out just enjoy it because nobody ever claimed to make documentaries when raoul walsh and errol flynn co worked 
like a lot of the comments above me also i though this was the average scifi movie but unfortunately it was not i found it rather patronizing and indeed preaching but that is not the only comment the scenes are very artificial not as in scifi as i will explain a in a few moments the next sentence is a small spoiler the movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups the physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other the middle one typically speaking in the worst case the other party is represented by one person also the interviews the reporters have are very artificial sometimes even unprofessional for example sometimes the discussion is between the reporters i mean from a point of the interviewed akward moreover the interview persons always stay calm they say everything without normal emotions i e you cannot tell whether they lie or not are mad or not they show almost nothing this is also very unprofessional the christian reporters always believe everything they are told by the people they interview bottom line all conversations contain facts pro con arguments there are no lies nobody lies the next sentence is a spoiler ignore if you still plan to see the movie the only lie happening is to demonstrate how bad non believers are this makes me conclude that the movie is a b movie it is very similar to plan from outer space from the s but this movie also has an annoying wrong set discussion about aliens and christian belief note i have no intention to insult christians people who believe in aliens or whomever else this is a thought i have about the movie not about people moreover i would like to note that i don t know whether the actors are bad or were just given terrible scripts 
this movie was probably one of the worst movies i ve seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply regret ehh where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies blatant dialog such as how ya doing not that great doc directly after an attempted exorcism of a man s daughter and then his wife s attempted suicide of course he s not that great was at some points kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattooed peirced girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah and they never actually got the deed done the acting horrible x i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel del zamora and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty music a gun and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody else s acting was horrible as well the lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters couldn t be counted on one hand like thumbs down p s what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways 
definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life i can t find anything positive to say about this movie if this production is even worthy of that word this production is not even the standard of a low budget porn movie my question is simply why did someone look at the script and think hey i m gonna make a movie out of this at the end of the movie i wasn t even hoping that nicole was going to make it she was really that annoying so for your own sake do not watch this movie unless you want to waste minutes of your life 
this is one of those movies which get better with each viewing i watched it three times and actually registered on imdb because i wanted to comment on it movies about food have been done before some of them are really good as for instance a certain japanese comedy which aficionados of asian cinema will know anyway but this one really is in its own league at its core is a protestant christian parable symbolizing the ideal of kindness but far from being dogmatic it also addresses the good in each and every of us regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof there is a pervading understatement and refinement in babette s feast but this makes the message of the movie if anything stronger not at all weaker if you cannot attend the extraordinary physical banquet offered by babette you re still welcome to this feast of the soul highly recommended 
battleship potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece the direction of eisenstein is truly a sight the film chronicles a ship of disgruntled sailors who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers eventually the sailors finally have enough of the abuse and send the officers packing during this time period there was a shortage of film stock in the soviet union the goverment wanted to get their message out to the people so they started a national film company and one of the members was sergei eisenstein the films were shot on miniscule budgets and the shortage of film stock forced eisentein to be careful and selective with the footage that he shot in the end eisenstein had to reuse footage in order to make a feature length picture the most famous of the action set pieces in this film is the much talked about massacre on the steps this scene was spoofed in bananas and most recently in brian de palma s the untouchables if you want to learn film making i strongly advise you to watch battleship potemkin it s one of the essentials a 
what we know of caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and thieves and hustlers and put them on canvas his works themes were sex death redemption above all finding the sacred within the profane he lived at a time where homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim strangling the boy for the purity of his scream you can t fault derek jarman for his cinematography nor his recreations of caravaggio s paintings and you certainly can t accuse the man of shying away from the homosexuality but frankly jarman never strays beyond s caricature italian patronage becomes the s london art scene complete with pretty waiters and calculators sean bean is a sexy bit of northern rough oiling his motorbike tilda swinton performs a transformation worthy of a mills and boons why miss lena without that gypsy headscarf you re beautiful jarman provides caravaggio with a particularly trite motive for the murder which left him exiled this could have been a visually stunning treatment of a man whose life was dangerous exciting violent and decadent but who nonetheless elevated the lives of ordinary people to the status of renaissance masterpieces looked on by emperors and kings instead what you get is pierre et gilles do italy the pretty bodies of young boys are shown to perfection but never the men who inhabit them jarman appears to satirise the london art scene showing it shallow and pretentious to use caravaggio and renaissance italy to make the point is to use a silk purse to make a pig s ear in fairness this film remains visually stunning but ultimately as two dimensional as the paintings it describes 
sure it is a new take on vampires who cares i would rather the old take if it is entertaining this was not entertaining it was a dull story poorly acted with annoying cinematography save your money don t even watch it on video 
nikki finn is the kind of girl i would marry never boring always thinking positively good with animals okay as one reviewer wrote a bit too much peroxide lipstick and eyebrows only madonna could get away with that but that s why i love nikki finn she s not your ordinary girl she makes things happen always exciting to be around and always honest sure she steals but she doesn t rob or murder unless you re out to do her in she knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be obeyed she knows what to take and what can t be stolen if you need a favor from her she s in bottom line she knows how to enjoy life nikki is always loving which is why she has a way with wild animals and completely dedicated to those she loves and who love her who s that girl she s the girl for me 
i give it a i reserve a rating for guy ritchie and woody allen films we don t even remember what this movie was about the only thing we recall is one gunshot scene where the actors drop to the ground roll to the other side of a hallway or something and then get back up shooting it was like watching year olds with broken legs trying to perform the stunts also when the characters were driving in a truck the engine noise or radio can t recall would vanish entirely when the actors were talking and like others we bought it because of the sandra bullock front cover very sad very bad 
i work at memorial hermann hospital tmc and was also working at texas children s hospital women s hospital and west houston during allison first the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban the texas medical center has a daytime population density similar to wall street there are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals tch was the largest children s hospital before it doubled in size twice methodist with its beds is one of the largest hospital in world the texas medical center skyline is bigger than that of memphis yet the best pics hollywood could muster are that of some dinky hospital in the middle of nowhere besides the real pic of the hospital taken decades ago also they combined several real life characters and portrayed them all in one super nurse i actually know the medical technologist s working in the blood bank two where actually working at the time but the movie shows only one pregnant mt there was a pregnant mt and another mt that took the precious patient antibody rolodex research alloantibodies for more info i will not mention their names privacy there was no nurse in the real life lab scene hollywood combined these two techs most likely to save time and money in the movie military helicopters true had to transfer the our babies nicu and picu to utmb all the way to galveston why you may ask when we have the largest children s hospital just down the street because texas children s hospital refused to take them you read right they refused being employed by them i was ashamed needless to say i m no longer affiliated with that facility any other comments would be repetitive to the ones already posted by the people that who actually live here or lived through the experience 
i watched this movie which i really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel disappointed in the end the problem i think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original there were too many flashbacks and too many bad effects which got me annoyed through the film i love debbie harry and isaac hayes but they disappointed me in this film they could of done much better this film seemed promising in the beginning dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end the film could never beat stanley kubrick s geniousness when it comes to controversial matters weirdness and originality in movies 
this movie is almost unknown but it is very good in a lonely danish town two old sisters live remembering a far youths when due to a strict puritan education they had to reject happiness lonely then the live in a dignified austerity until babette who flies from paris frightened by the horror of the war arrives in few time she will be able to turn the goodness and love she received when she arrived a good lottery prize lets her organize a great banquet following the best rules of french gastronomy all neighbourhoods are invited all fanatically puritans they accept but they pact to not show any trace of pleasure or enjoyment as it would be a sin however the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat that they become seduced by the sensuality of french gastronomy the banquet end in a very felt though quietly happiness the love between humans has awaken the miracle of rise the human kindness due to the pleasure of the sense has begun the movie is surprisingly good but it is not for all tastes during most of the movie nothing happens all is so quiet and so peaceful that during many minutes you can only see the life of the inhabitants of the town but as the movie develops it becomes more precious when babette wins the lottery prize after min movie the show begins the author is able with a perfect directing to show us how babette prepares the banquet how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful one love all told in a quiet delicious way with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting then as the banquet goes by the quality in showing us how the mood of all eaters changes due to the meal only with first shots with impressively filmed scenes one after another is simply astonishing in addition the tact with the colours and the photography is also superb almost every scene of the movie is like a picture so work is involved there if you are able to admire good cinema and are able to realize that sometimes the way on telling you something rather than what is told is more important this is your movie if you happen to like good meals and just love the good gastronomy probably you ll feel amused as most feelings of the movie will be familiar to you an oscar totally deserved the only problem is its slowness at setting up the story but i can forgive it i hope everyone too 
the fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and of course more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie the story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out in one moment you think that something happens to coach jones or radio well it does but certainly not what you d expect the film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by ed harris cuba gooding jr are some of their best in my opinion the ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right well i guess that was what michael tollin mike rich were trying to do first class movie esbj rn nordby birch denmark 
 the man who knew too much is alfred hitchcock s own remake of his thriller about a married couple james stewart and doris day on vacation in morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder espionage assassinations and the worst of all kidnapping of their years old son the movie which hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun stewart and day have a good chemistry together the film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense the inclusion of que sera sera proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like que sera sera did in the man who knew too much hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from arthur benjamin storm cloud cantata for almost ten minutes while scene in london s royal albert hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time you know that the characters after finding out that the so called gift from god was actually a loan will pay back the money and that everyone will be happy at the end but how they get there is not as obvious the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip frank gorshin shirley jones and cloris leachman prove that they are capable of more than playing the riddler mother partridge or mary s friend phyllis while jill eikenberry and wendie malick play characters different than we have seen on their tv series ursula burton s portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good music including a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try i don t think you will be disappointed 
i started watching this expecting the worst i was happy to find that the film turned out to be enjoyable slightly confusing in parts like when they all justs started singing it gave me a chance to see daniel wu in action for the first time he is a better actor than i thought at times he seemed a bit out of place i thought purple storm deserves its hong kong legends release as it is different to most other hk films it is about a mans emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss it may sound corny but when he eventually pieces out what and who he actually is it really makes the film a lot more interesting once you get into the film you will find it keeps you gripped to it as if you miss one bit then a lot of the film wil make sense for example i missed a bit at the start and i recommend to anyone that watches this that they do not miss any of it so i can say that this film was worth watching and a grateful surprise for me that i enjoyed it 
first things first how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this i saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head what exactly is director trying to say if its a thriller there are no thrills if its action there is no action barring a chase sequence there is no drama and the much touted love story it actually never takes off no passion emotion nothing is there actually i never expected wonders from the movie however after the bumper opening it took i thought of giving it a chance i have no problems with himesh reshamiya whatsoever and i am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity i went in with an open mind and came out with a closed one let s not put the blame of himesh reshamiya he is just a debutant actor but direction screenplay writing makeup everything has gone for a toss himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the curve he can do the don kind of roles hansika is just a kid and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walks the only actor who was good was the friend of himesh in the movie i don t know his name but he looks promising watch it at your own risk not even good to watch it for a time pass viewing strongly recommend to avoid this movie 
it finally hit me watching my vhs of christmas in connecticut what other film this one reminded me of if it weren t for the fact that the other was done years later i d say it was a remake just as rock hudson was a phony fishing expert for abercrombie fitch who had to get some on the job training at a fishing tournament barbara stanwyck plays an forties version of martha stewart stanwyck s a cooking columnist who s built up this whole image of living on a small connecticut farm with husband and baby cooking all these marvelous delicacies trouble is she s unmarried childless writes her column from her apartment in new york and doesn t know how to boil water but her writing is a hit with the public trouble comes when she s hijacked into cooking a home christmas dinner for a war hero sailor played by dennis morgan who gets to sing a couple of songs as well got to keep up the image at any cost and her publisher sidney greenstreet likes the idea so well that he invites himself to the dinner so with borrowed farm baby and reginald gardiner who d like to make it real with stanwyck she tries to brazen it through christmas in connecticut s now a yuletide classic and deservedly so the leads are warm and human and they get great support from the assembled players s z sakall as the hungarian restaurant owner friend of stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information and una o connor as the housekeeper have a nice chemistry between them reginald gardiner and stanwyck have no chemistry at all obvious to all but reggie and he s funny in his stuffed shirt way most people remember this film as one of sidney greenstreet s few ventures into comedy if he s not an outright villain a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon greenstreet is few other things on screen christmas in connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the most of it in a biography of barbara stanwyck she mentions she enjoyed making christmas in connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous parts like double indemnity she d been doing recently one of the things that made doing the film so enjoyable was that between takes director peter godfrey and greenstreet would do some impromptu entertaining of cast and crew with english music hall numbers made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly now if only someone had been filming those numbers 
a terrific fast paced screwball like comic strip drama farce set against france s implosion played with wide eyed straight faced intensity by a talented cast and chockablock with action satire social commentary and authentic period details from slick brillantined hairdos and marcelled hairdos to a fleet of citroen tractions a rollicking soundtrack and brief but credible impersonations of charles de gaulle and marshal petain it s simply some of the best entertainment recently shown on screen devoid of presumption and message if movies were trains and there is a creative recreation of a trip on a steam driven train that works despite there being no steam locomotive an expensive prop no doubt this would be a tgv 
a severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing guy rolfe so fantastic as andre toulon in part three barely features this time and richard band s fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film for the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of bodega bay inn gordon currie and some youth friends of his many of the cast are canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles teresa hill is quite yummy totems minions of the egyptian god sutek want the secret of animation life back and the puppets when they surface act with a previously unseen cleverness to attempt to destroy the ugly and very computer game looking totems the totems merely complicate the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique they don t share the weird beauty of the puppets and thus don t really fit in top scene is pinhead using a rag to clean blood from tunnelers drill bit classic and about the goriest this film goes the fifth film was filmed concurrently with this one so expect similar sections of mediocre and a toulon performance that seems to have been filmed in a different era or even galaxy guy rolfe deserved better and series fans certainly do grrrrrrr 
as with all haneke films make your own decision don t be swayed by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends see it yourself isabelle huppert is stunning in this film combined with haneke these two never pull their punches haneke reels us in with the lure of golden boy benoit magimel but this is an anti romance as much as funny games was an anti thriller you ll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release but it s incredibly nervy and thought provoking haneke continues to hold up a mirror to how desensitised western civilization is or has become people may turn their noses up at this but it s only taking what solondz did in happiness a few steps further while grounded in reality much of what erika huppert does can be viewed as emotional metaphor i m not recommending it but i wouldn t dissuade you either it definitely divides people but given it s largely about repression that s no surprise 
superhero movie is the most recent in the long line over parody movie movies which i despise so much i wish this movie could be the death of the genre but i know that it isn t awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin if meet the spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go than superhero movie is probably near the top unfortunately meet the spartans was actually miles below the barrel and this movie just barely makes it in superhero movie has a decent cast of c list celebs it s got drake bell the kid from disney s drake and josh leslie nielson airplane tracy morgan snl and rock and a few others scattered throughout although it has the star power to light a watt bulb the movie fails to utilize any humor this movie is about minutes long most of which is dedicated to following the spiderman plot and not one single joke is funny i didn t laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire time don t see this movie don t even think about it for the love of cinema just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another one oh who am i kidding they ll probably come out with another one by fall 
i m usually disappointed by what the media dubs lesbian movies these days murderous bisexuals psychotic murderous lesbians women who experiment with other women but end up with men at the end ridiculously good looking women who only get w each other to turn men on etc thankfully fingersmith is on a very high pedestal above this garbage it is a credible love story acted marvelously by every cast member down to the least of the supporting actors aside from having a very engaging central conflict the romance between the heroines is well developed and believable thanks to cassidy and hawkins i have also seen tipping the velvet but fingersmith is far superior to the former both in character conflict development and the quality of the acting fingersmith is both satisfying and enjoyable to watch offering lesbians everywhere a great follow up act to bound

yes thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie the acting is below average and the special effects are horrible in fact the worst i have ever seen it is a very low budget movie there is no way this movie will can scare you it has no creepy or scary moments mr bone eater was more of a funny creature for me it could have been much better but oh well they didn t had a big budget the movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie lol i would name this movie the time eater waster i am sure you would have a lot of better movies etc to watch still watch it if you have nothing else to watch you get to watch it for free not worth renting at all 
here s another antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or dvd i saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time even in metropolitan movie capital l a for a couple of weeks and then disappeared art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory where older favorites like antonioni and resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities at first i was disappointed thought the pace to be unbearably boring and that the man had lost a chance for years antonioni had found it difficult to find financing at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon but knowing antonioni for what he was and how i had at first reacted to blow up and the passenger i refused to pass judgment until i had seen the film again i went back the next day and i should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in making me aware of things i had thought about and lost track of throughout my life driving home in a contemporary setting points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in l aventurra forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristcally and fascinatingly alienated in tone and quite comedic actually that i couldn t get enough the scene with malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach with the weather so beautifully silver skied and the eno u track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm had been my favorite it still was but now the whole film was just as great what a strange phenomenon the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which antonioni s eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate the odd thing is though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous sophie marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you this film is unmistakably antonioni s to its core but you will not sense to what a profound extent until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm for example it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor something i did not notice at first but was turned on to by another critic and noticed to much delight on further viewings before they pulled it and would ve gone back for more if this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it i have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of antonioni s s films but the s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed dvd version if and when it s released i urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see beyond the clouds and add a piece of magic to the tragic 
the movie was slow the dialogue between actors actresses felt flat and basically there was no development of the characters in the story omar epps skulks around with a mad look on his face the entire time pouting and basically looking annoyed with everybody danes has no on screen magic and ribisi s character is a goober that nobody would want to hang out with even if they were paid to do so throw in the weird scene where epps has to dance with an old man and you have what quite possibly could be the worst movie in cinema history i watched it on satellite thank goodness i didn t pay for it and wished i hadn t do yourself a favor and go sort your underwear and socks drawer if you need something to do but are tempted to watch this movie when if it comes on your tv awful movie if you ask me and i generally have something good to say about just about any movie out there 
if you have ever seen a bollywood movie you know they are longer than most movies due to the multiple song and dance routines each one is over five minutes long fortunately this one has fewer song and dance routines and fits into the standard movie length don t get me wrong i like bollywood movies but tend to fast forward through the song and dance portions i bought this dvd because i am an ian bohen fan although his role wasn t as large as i hoped he still had a good amount of screen time and his character was much different than his other roles overall this was a good movie like most bollywood movies there is at least one element of controversy conflict of the traditional indian culture but true love triumphs over adversity and a happy ending is had by all 
what can i say about this film that won t give you any preconceived notions when you see it very little the plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down what follows after that is the movie it is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended it is not a perfect film the film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story even more confused if you ve read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere you ll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on i m not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have if you like horror and don t mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl 
what s fun about barker s nightbreed is that it s the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burton s work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barker especially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankenstein s monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie this isn t a masterpiece and even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but it s pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look 
kramer vs kramer won five oscars including best picture of this intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years walks out on him leaving him to care for his son and build a relationship with him he never had robert benton s incisive screenplay presents us flawed but real human beings with hearts souls and brains for instance in the scene where joanna announces to ted she s leaving him she doesn t just storm out the door she gives him the keys her credit cards the dry cleaning ticket tells him which bills have been paid and informs him she has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married no more this decision to leave was not a whim it was thought about and joanna felt with no other option than to leave if she was leaving she was going to do it properly and with no specific plan in mind she did not think it right to take billy dustin hoffman won an oscar for his ted kramer a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon he had no clue that his life at home was crumbling into pieces meryl streep also won an oscar playing joanna the unhappy wife who we feel sympathy for in the beginning of the film but that all changes when she returns for her son hoffman is at the top of his form here i always tear up during the scene where he tries to explain to billy justin henry oscar nominee why his mom left and he does it all in a stage whisper or when he meets joanna upon her return and slams her drink into a wall a hoffman moment not in the script that streep was not told about in order to get a natural reaction justin henry hits all the right notes as billy the confused little boy who doesn t know why his mom is gone and doesn t know how to communicate with his father jane alexander also got an oscar nod as ted and joanna s neighbor margaret who has switched allegiances by the film s conclusion this is an intense family drama but there are laughs to be had here too billy and the chocolate chip ice cream billy pouting because ted is late picking him for a party billy catching his dad s one night stand jobeth williams on her way to the bathroom stark naked but it s the moments of human drama you remember ted running through manhattan with billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after billy falls off the jungle gym ted getting fired right before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene he tells the guy in a whisper shame on you and of course the finale where joanna tells ted she s not taking billy which i found a little hard to swallow why would she go to all that trouble of suing for custody and then just change her mind but this is a small quibble regarding a wonderful movie masterfully directed by robert benton and flawlessly performed by a top notch cast a must see 
i had enjoyed the masters of horror series until i came upon this infantile dung heap this anti bush propaganda piece masquerading as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original batman done by michael moore political satire should be clever this however pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an l ron hubbard film in its campy inane way it accuses the republicans of stealing elections going to war for absolutely no reason and treating servicemen and women as mere cannon fodder it even takes a swipe at the second amendment and religion all that was missing was caesar romero as the president cackling in glee about how he orchestrated i guess the ending was supposed to be the we support our troops moment but i think they would be more offended than pleased with the entire endeavor i m sure the hollywood elites are sitting in their malbu mansions patting each other on the backs for this pithy work while the misinformed anti war drones hail it as genius time to get fitted with new tinfoil hats kids 
nothing more than a soccer knock off of the mighty ducks this film proved to be annoying in most aspects this was one of those times where you re parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don t have to deal with them for a few hours to say the least my younger sisters liked it but it proved to be too much like the far superior mighty ducks oh well at least olivia d abo was hot and steve guttenberg still had a job at that point in time 
well some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin kicking some ass if that s what you want and you wear a cloak file your teeth to points and think that the name lilith silver is cool you ll see a fine film if like most people an assassin dressed in gleaming creaking rubber with huge cleavage thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh then this is one of the best comedies you ll see i laughed so hard i nearly cried ridiculous acting dialogue and plotting help to make this a better spoof than dracula dead and loving it could be it tries to be cool and goth and all it succeeds in doing is making each scene hilarious even the tacked on lesbian scene is funny how did she get those boots off that quickly they were laced up to here don t see it if you like good films see it if you like terrible films and want to laugh until you fall over it isn t good it s just bad 
it s wartime drama wwii with french and jews and germans but this one is somehow fun earnestly so director jean paul rappeneau co wrote the script to his well received film bon voyage unlike director bertrand tavernier s safe conduct aka laissez passer w d rolf schubel s gloomy sunday or w d claude berri s lucie aubrac bon voyage is as chipper as its title sounds c est la vie whatever and we have the beautiful talented isabelle adjani to thank for it is her delightful performance throughout as the center of attraction and attention the cause and effect of it all that made the film so enjoyable as it is hell what s another derailment of her plan and expectations will worry about that another time the backbone of the story does revolve around a pair of young enthusiasts gr gori derang re as fr d ric and virginie ledoyen from francois ozon s women as camille the incomparable g rard depardieu the witty yvan attal of my wife is an actress and versatile peter coyote juggling french english and german here are some of the stellar cast involved there are many characters coming and going in this plot of a movie and how it s all juggled is a skilful knack that requires no analysis rappeneau is simply a genius the story just builds upon itself one episode after another or even with overlapping events but never confusing that s the delight of it all somehow every detail turns out right on the screen and we just lap it all up like a tastily presented french dessert literally so there s thrills trills tender hesitant moments and taut ominous escapes all playing out in front of our eyes from reading the director s note on the sony pictures classics bon voyage official site rappeneau indicated this is his most personal and successful work ever depicting bordeaux from memories of his childhood years is very much close to his heart and he had worked and reworked the script for almost years this film is a labor of love all round the cast and crew complementing the director s passion and a formidable script by collaborative writers along with the director and his son julien adaptation efforts by gilles marchand patrick modiano and j r me tonnerre music by gabriel yared varied in tone from his previous film scores like the english patient or talented mr ripley who provided a befitting theme that kept the pace and rhythm of the plot going almost like a train going non stop reflecting adjani s viviane s vivacious energy even when she s tired keeping her going as she meets whatever comes walking on with head held high and stylish attire always no looking back let alone time for regrets ah mustn t forget the wonderfully translated skilful subtitles by ian burley who also did subtitles for films in italian bread and tulips aka pane e tulipani the last kiss aka l ultimo bacio and tom tykwer s heaven if you find this much too light a wartime relationship drama try w d m x f berb ck s aim e and jaguar in german based on a true story with brilliant performances from juliane k hler as aim e and maria schrader as jaguar 
i saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes i read somewhere that oz and rudnick wanted to poke fun at liberal message movies but the climax ends up being right out of one of those movies also some of the humor is a bit on the cloying side joan cusack was too over the top for me and someone has a strange timeline re the oscars still there were more than enough funny moments like the kiss scene the wedding that isn t and the scene with the principal to enjoy this kline as always is good but for me the real surprise was selleck whom i m not a big fan of but pokes fun at himself nicely here 
 christmas in connecticut is an absolute gem and a must see for christmas elizabeth lane a precursor to martha stewart is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers the perfect wife mother and domestic goddess only thing is she is none of these things a total phony unfortunately for her she is about to be found out her publisher mr alexander yardley a brilliant comic turn by sydney greenstreet gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to elizabeth s perfect farm for the christmas holiday only thing there is no farm perfect or otherwise the comedy involves how elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job elizabeth s colleague john happens to have a farm in connecticut so that solves that problem however he wants to marry liz but she does not want to marry him he offers her marriage though he knows she doesn t feel the same way about him that he does about her he makes the offer anyway and assures her that he is willing to wait and here barbara stanwyck as liz delivers one of the most devastating put downs i have ever heard with perfect innocence she replies could you wait that long ouch in addition the scenes between una o conner and s z sakall are hilarious they don t seem to like one another though one suspects they really do they are rivals in the household and s z sakall s mangled english is equaled by nora s strangled pronunciation of his name mr basternook my name is felix it is amazing how christmas y these black and white films are great character work by all involved don t miss this one 
 and boy is it soft i saw this on cable channel bravo one saturday night and here in britain we often have these dire erotic soft core movies turning up late at night on bravo this one follows a weird science type plot of a couple of college geeks building a virtual reality headset that makes you have sexual fantasies when you`ve seen one of these movies you`ve seen them all with a bunch of bimbos looking like they`re advertising silicone implants come on i`ve actually seen breasts in real life i`m sure some other of us have too and they wobble around unlike here where they defy the laws of if not physics than at least gravity the sex scenes are these tedious affairs where a well buffed geezer rubs himself against his co star without any dialogue or sound apart from some muzak and when they climax it looks like they`re both having a bad attack of constipation the girls themselves are very pretty especially brandy davis and nikki fritz but they`re wasted in these type of soft core movies and if it`s fantasy you`re after i recommend the lord of the rings trilogy
i saw this film at the rotterdam international film festival this seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival however as it turned out all the more interesting the story of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction is based on actual facts moreover the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again this time for the film which is partly set up as a stage play not only do they all happen to be good actors jia hongsheng s parents are actors in real life as well the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards jia are very effective jia hongsheng is the actor of some chinese action films late eighties start nineties later you can see him in great films such as frozen and suzhou river in between these two career paths jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso i like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs we really feel the pain and struggle jia is in at the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him the film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern jia seems to be caught in dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him because there are personal interviews with the characters we feel like we are getting to know jia not only through himself but through others as well the film has a heavy feel but scenes of jia cycling through bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone so does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after this is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern chinese film this is a strong recommendation 
imagine what it must have been like for john agar one of hollywood s handsome leading men married to shirley temple for five years he finds himself doing movies like this i remember him in tarantula where he wasn t half bad unfortunately there is nothing to recommend this film the monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent the police are boring the teenagers are boring the plot is stupid people run around there are events that do nothing to advance the plot there s dancing that goes on and on and then there is no attack there is some idiotic love triangle that no one could care the least about it isn t even campy or outrageous it s just no worth anything agar might as well have been a post he s given nothing to do 
yes it s a sbif so bad it s funny classic with a budget running into the tens of dollars some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen and absolutely no even remotely frightening moments not even a nanosecond camera work was at the elementary school level one still shot outside a house was obviously hand held and jiggled crazily blood looked like watered down cherry koolaid someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the human bones and miss witch had the cheapest mask wal mart could provide did anyone involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was most of the names in the credits have to be pseudonyms it would be career suicide to have this on your resume do yourself a favor and watch ebert s video of his colonoscopy instead 
the only reason i gave this episode of masters of horror a instead of a is because the two lead actors are good and it wasn t shot on vhs the story the dialog and the plot are ridiculous talking driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war give me a break what next zombies who come back to go skydiving maybe zombies who come back to host qvc shows i never supported the iraq war but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces and homecoming was disrespectful in that it mocks the true horror of war with zombies being mass produced in today s market this is the spam of zombie related entertainment how homecoming made it onto masters of horror is beyond me 
i am writing this with minutes left before the film finishes i feel comfortable writing it now because unfortunately i know exactly how this film is going to end the premise is simple enough rabid dog on the loose in a small town kills people great simple plot for a good fun camp s horror uhh no the main problem is this is based on a book stephen king and you can tell that is should not have really been adapted to film at least not with the same plot why cuz its boring the first minutes tries to build depth to its main characters and create suspense it however lasts too long half the film the characters are unlikeable and we never care for them anyway and it just about creates zero suspense the easiest film according to plot and time to compare this to it the classic jaws everything that jaws does right cujo does wrong jaws created good characters and a genuine feeling of dread cujo does neither jaws effectively creates a scary creepy villain in its shark cujo has a dirty st bernard running about growling and jumping and not a lot else jaws is exciting and unpredictable cujo is a tireless bore that remains predictable right to the end also confusing is the plethora of subplots that just act as boring red herrings to the films main plot if this film was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director this could have been good but it wasn t it was a waste of minutes of my life people on here are saying this is one of the best king adaptations im sorry you could not be more wrong the mist is a hundred times better thinner is times better and even the one with the cats is twice as good this in my opinion is one of the worst the only good thing was the action scenes with the dog looked real even though they were dull films ended now and it didn t get any better avoid 
typically a movie can have factors like arousing good feel sense of purpose plot etc there s always something that can be taken out of movies its just a matter of how compelling the reason is for me to own it in my collection tale of two sisters as they call it when it was released in my country has tremendous feel and an eventually mostly self explaining plot i love horror movies that revolve around a house titles that come to mind are the others the haunting the haunting of hell house this movie will be a another great example that i will remember the movie had extremely rich colour in the way the house was decorated in the clothes that the characters wore in the open skied daylight scenes that is in contrast to most horror movies which typically makes use of desaturated tones and gloomy environs think honogurai mizu no soko kara dark water which is another show i like that gives this film a sense of aesthetics and joy when it wasn t in its more gripping moments the characters are extremely believable this may be partly attributed to the familiar setting of this movie maybe domestic issues are easier for both myself as well as the actors to identify with and the actors become their characters with exceptional finesse the director toys with timelines in order to give the audience the story in bits and pieces allowing them to come to their own terms of interpretation instead of presenting everything in a linear fashion this is a positive aspect of this film in my opinion and perhaps it is my interpretation of this movie that allows me to find it enjoyable i would definitely look out for this on dvd 
this film is so bad it s hilarious i watched hell ride half thinking it was a comedy although i couldn t quite work out if they were actually taking the p ss or if this really was a serious attempt at making something decent i notice it isn t listed here as a comedy so they must be serious it s basically seems to be about a gang of pensioners who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine one scene inexplicably has two characters smashing bottles over each others heads then showing each other get out of jail free cards that they ve made also check out vinnie jones accent where the hell is he meant to be from oh and there s a load of naked girls in it too who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than to have none stop sex with these leathery skinned b stards the guy who wrote and directed it a pee wee herman lookalike with a greeshan d beard and an orange sunbed tan has for some reason cast himself in the lead role maybe this is part of the joke i don t know actually the more i think about it the more i m sure this film is a p ss take it s produced by quentin tarantino and it s possible he s released this in humour as a bit of a laugh it is a total rip off of tarantino s style but just done really really badly it is very amusing though and i guess either way it could go down as a cult classic either from being an amusing parody of the tarantino rodriguez style or something that is very very unintentionally funny has to be seen to be believed 
this formulaic film hero s girlfriend marries the villain just didn t move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story scott seems too old in this one and too many times his character turns away from decisive action deflating the scenes he responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly he escapes from knox s gang by hiding in a full rain barrel his escape to the high country and pursuit by john russell seem superfluous as does much of the film the plot could have been tightened high points of the film seeing tennessee ernie ford without a mustache singing man in the saddle alfonso bedoya s too brief scenes as a cook the color photography of the high country and the fight scene there with john russell 
i am really sad that that this film has got so much negative criticism i think it is a nice little comedy and really funny the humour in this film is kind of warm and innocent and i like it i also like madonna s character and i do not agree that she played herself she has created a character and a sympathetic one my favourite scenes were the fighting scene on top of the sinking car and where madonna climbs over the fence in a fancy dress to claim her love the humour in the film has a slightly syrrealistic touch and perhaps it is not everybody s cup of tea but it s their problem not of the film i found this film wholesome and sunny in fact the day i first saw it i was incredibly sad for some reason and this film lit up my day and madonna can act just take off your glasses of negative thinking 
if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining it s got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting match ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles as evident on this board the picture doesn t pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction i know i know that s hard to do when you consider custer s last stand at the little big horn and it s prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess there s an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it there s a lot to take in here though for the picture s two hour plus run time custer s arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy putting him up in the major s headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in custer s first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie hattie mcdaniel i hadn t noticed it before in other films but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene was a hoot too as for flynn it s interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed j e b stuart opposite ronald reagan s depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynn s portrayal here it s more than evident but it doesn t come close to that of richard mulligan s take on the military hero in s little big man let s just say that one was a bit over the top the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one s point of view earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer s character when he stated you take glory with you when it s your time to go 
 the piano teacher is all about huppert s character a middle aged classical piano instructor with a stoic facade behind which lurks a powerfully compelling aberrant personality unsatisfying as a story but intriguing as a character study the film follows the huppert character through the term of her anguished relationship with a pupil delivering superb performances in the process not for everyone the piano teacher will play best with those into foreign films and character driven dramas dealing with dark issues a 
first the positives an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film some of the shots could be paintings by de chirico sophie marceau beautiful the negatives the stories are hard to believe unreal uni dimensional characters preen and posture of the time as if they were in some kind of catwalk this is neither the antonioni of his earlier much better movies nor the wenders we ve all come to know and appreciate malkovich is excess baggage in this movie 
i must say when i saw this film at a on this site i figured it was well worth a view i was sorely disappointed from nearly the opening scene it is obvious the two supposed fbi agents are in fact the killers could they have made it any more obvious if that is the intended twist in this film that s pretty sad while pullman and ormond are excellent actors even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer and that s the problem there is no switch from i m playing fbi guy to i just killed people and boy are my arms tired you can t blame the actors the story fails in far more ways than one from the onset of the film however i was certain i was wrong that no director writer would ever be so blatantly obvious about a plot twist ormond and pullman must just be acting strangely in order to divert the viewer s attention from the real killers i thought which gave the film s makers far too much credit i should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it even made it past the minute mark to lynch s credit she did manage to interject many things that make a good film sex violence humor and well trained actors too bad they were in the wrong configuration hopefully pell james can recover from this role i found her performance particularly impressive as the stunning drug addict turned would be savior she should have rewritten the role so the crack whore would win those people who have compared this film to natural born killers take note tarantino made the characters of mickey and mallory reprehensible yet sympathetic the artistry of that film far overpowers the gore and this is not seen once in surveillance surveillance only wishes it were natural born killers in fact it has wet dreams about being even a fraction of what that film was folks who haven t seen surveillance stick to something with a little more intelligence like camp rock 
i had seen this movie before but i could not remember it was this fantastic it has a fun plot madonna fumbles around the city with pumas etc causing a commotion and the music is just perfect and the happy ending who s that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like me in my opinion this could be even the best madonna movie i have ever seen 
the famous closeup of their breakfast meat crawling with maggots still is recorded by fire in my neurons or the wind filling the right places of the sails the fog better than carpenter s the fog cos is the real terror bursting out from human history instead of pirates ghosts but i tell ya something not even the magnificent scene in homenage performed by brian di palma with the excellent music of ennio morricone in the untochables filmed in slow motion can equal the effect of the original masterpiece of the crowd climbing down the ladders we see not merely the baby stroller but i remember the hand of a baby stepped by militar boot someone with no feet escaping at the last minute someone wearing glasses then a cut edition and then the same glasses broken by a bullet that passed through mini stories in a single scene

what can i say this was one awful movie to watch i am normally not very critical of gay cinema in general due to the fact that most are usually low budget but this really pushed me up the wall i mean is this was has happened to gay cinema haven t gay producers and directors learned anything from gus van saints and ang lee s films just having to sit through the entire movie was like being in a dentist s chair and having my wisdom teeth extracted i kept on praying for moments where i would feel any sort of connection with any of the characters but that never happened most of the characters performances were just not very convincing it was like watching one of those badly produced made for tv movie specials on a local access tv stations i cannot tell u how greatly disappointed it was seeing this film after being a big fan of tori spellings other works and the directors last work on latter day saints it was definitely not worth the wait definitely a few hours of my life i will never get back and will certainly not be purchasing it on dvd 
the movie takes place during the year and the french are about to loose the war the movie includes all genres comedy romantic murder and history it is probable the historical part may be not as probable as the rest it is not however a big laugh movie but the occasional large smile 
this film offers many delights and surprises when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film the story unfolds in th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch you share general loewenhielm s exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor babette is an artist whose medium is food perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share her creations so directly the main theme of this movie the potential that the sharing of food has to transform how people see each other and how they see the world is much the same as the theme of chololat but babette s feast does not hit you over the head with its message the townspeople are conservative puritans but not exaggeratedly oppressive you come to understand and respect them and ultimately to appreciate their humanity many issues are raised for you to reflect on the nature of art the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken the relationship between the spiritual and the physical the effect of environment on behavior the taking of life to give life among others the only disappointment for me was general loewenhielm s speech delivered at the climax of the meal i expected deep heartfelt observations but i got some vague mystical ramblings the speech had such a minimal impact that i hardly remember it but this understated film leaves a lasting impression the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 
 radio is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged james robert kennedy nicknamed radio and the football coach from the t l hanna high school harold jones cuba gooding jr is excellent as radio i would never imagine to see him in a serious performance specially because most of the movies i watch with him are comedies ed harris is great as harold jones but this actor is great so this is not anything new the mentally challenged young man called james robert kennedy always walk around the t l hanna high school without bothering anyone and almost not noticed one day when the football s ball is throw near him he decides to stay with the ball for the impatience of johnny cash one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met one day cash decides to punish james mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up when coach jones discovers that horrible act he stays angry and punish all the team deciding for this day on to help james who gets the nickname radio because of his passion for radios in general the movie shows how radio becomes an adept assistant helping the team train despite hardships from the players and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city i would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story it has a life lesson specially showing us how a person can make a difference even not being what we call normal radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone and that s a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives 
what the heck do people expect in horror films these days anyway does is have to be something grisly like saw or it s just crap now i don t claim to be an all knowing expert but i m about i ve seen and own literally thousands of films and i honestly think this director really gave this film a good sincere effort believe me i was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started assuming it was gonna be awful and i was pleasantly surprised it s no mamet script that s for sure but come on with all the horrible garbage out there especially in horror i thought this one was way closer to the top of the pile than most the director used a lot of neat clever camera angles the soundtrack was excellent and moody perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film the editing and timing were very good and it didn t resort to the tired worn clich of excessive slasher violence for example minor spoiler during an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous but tasty uh i mean tasteful nude shower scene i fully expect her to get sliced and diced but amazingly we just get to enjoy her heavenly loveliness and that s it end minor spoiler also the tension was built very well leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what s what spoiler especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and pinnochio alone in the office we see the doll actually talking to her but in the video recording we do not also the mom sees pinnochio moving about and being quite nasty so are both the mom and daughter mentally ill also there is the original killer and what the mom had surmised about a possible evil influence but even with all that we are still not quite sure who was doing the killing end spoiler so all in all i believe that it was a good strong sincere effort to create some good ol early full moon type style and with a lot of restraint on the violence and with no typical sleaze thrown in for no reason just the lovely innocent beautiful shower scene which i will remember to the end of my days compared to the absolute mindless drivel out there a definite strong 
the first half of this film held some promise as it seemed like the film was going to be a low key character psychodrama like the minus man but then the whole thing collapses into cliche and the viewer slowly loses all interest there s a decent cast here but the film is lifeless and the talent completely wasted 
some people say the pace of this film is a little slow but how is this different from any other hitchcock movie they all move very deliberately and as a point have spurts of suspense and brilliant montages injected through it this movie gives us just the right amount of comic relief which make the suspense scenes seem all the more suspenseful the albert hall scene is one of the best examples of pure cinema that exists in hitchcock s collection the best probably being almost all of rear window pure cinema for hitchcock meant a series of usually small pieces of film fit together without dialogue in order to tell the story visually this is of course the basic definition of the albert hall sequence as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the picture not many slip ups by hitchcock here and the acting is superb especially by doris day in a rather surprising serious role 
i can appreciate satire that goes against my own views but it must be witty and well placed this film is how can i possibly explain it it does not make the slightest attempt at subtlety much less intelligence in fact it s hardly even horror dead soldiers come to life but they re not interested in brains only in voting booths why cue a never ending stream of the most idiotic banal bloated windbag ravings of bad president bad conservatives bad republicans what a self indulgent schmaltzy cornball piece of hog manure this was even if they agree with the episode s points only the stupidest of liberals would say they enjoyed watching it then again assigning a degree of stupidity to the crazed angry hostile anti social and anti anything halfway normal liberal spectrum is a tall task in itself avoid like a liberal convention 
after reading a biography on the last russian tzar nicholas ii and his failure to secure the army s support i decided to give this film a try i watched it with a completely open mind not knowing anything about it except its reputation these are the things that impressed me the most the shots of battleships and the soldiers used as extras more than once i stopped to think if this was done in this time and place of this would have been computer generated the realism in it from the maggot infested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend killed for a bowl of soup this movie makes no concessions to the pc cause which thankfully hadn t been invented yet the slow descent into madness of the odessa steps sequence from the first shot when the limbless man appears you get the idea something might be wrong since the overall shots are composed though you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings then an amputee appears and people start falling in dramatic poses still the shots are composed until the cossacks appear into scene and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear this scene is easily worth the price of admission the fact that this movie is unadulterated propaganda then again when rambo fought in afghanistan he also was having something to do with propaganda only a different kind overall a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative nevertheless metropolis the cabinet of dr caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today they really make modern movies look boring and repetitive 
 shade tries hard to be another sting substituting poker for horse racing as the means by which to bring down an enemy but it fails miserably i watched the whole thing and still never could quite understand why the young kid wanted to double cross his partner was it because his partner stole his girl is there a woman in the world who is worth going to that much trouble over if there is it certainly wasn t this shrew she had no redeeming qualities whatsoever and really now did she actually have a special room set up so that a surgeon could remove the kidney from whoever tried to pick her up in a bar dina merrill makes a short appearance as a rich woman who hosts of all things pay the rent poker parties at her palatial home and then the players say things like i ll see your thousand and raise you another five thousand give me a break you can t call see and raise you do one or the other any kid playing for nickels and dimes at the kitchen table knows this you d think grown men playing for stakes this high or at least the knuckleheads who wrote the script would know it too one of the other posters mentioned how no high limit poker game would allow players to actually deal their own cards and i agree you don t allow two of the best known car cheats into a game where the buy in is and then let them deal to each other that s not poker that s just seeing which one can cheat better and i d like to know what person in his right mind would buy in to a game in which two of the best known card cheats are playing and expect that he might have a chance at winning and most of all what mafia boss would run such a game every time melanie griffith came on the screen i was so mesmerized by those gigantic fluorescent red lips of hers that i completely lost the storyline and seeing her and stallone together was more like a public service announcement for plastic surgery gone wrong than a love connection stallone mentions that she used to be a grifter before she bought the restaurant she now runs but we don t know what kind of grifter she was and we never see her working with stallone in their younger days so we are left to wonder if we even care that much jamie foxx is the best character in the whole movie but he gets killed off right off the bat and we re left with cardboard cut outs who all sound like they re reading their lines off a teleprompter just off camera the ending makes no sense either the kid gets his cut from the game and just walks down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen the mafia isn t watching every move he makes everyone else just shrugs their shoulders and quietly accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recoup any of it i don t think so most of all this movie does a great injustice to professional poker players all over the world insinuating that the only way to win is by palming cards and playing with juiced decks and why is it they re always palming kings and aces sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a straight or full house the best parts of the whole film are the sleight of hand tricks during the beginning and ending credits everything in between is ridiculous 
unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that jim carrey producing and starring and brian grazer have worked on together but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs basically dick harper carrey thinks he is being promoted to a better job that s until the company of dynocorpe sinks and closes down now dick and his wife jane t a leoni and their son of course are in trouble with money no matter what they try they can t raise the kind of money they really want so they start robbing a few places and then they decide to rob the guy that set dick up his ex boss jack mcallister alec baldwin i think the most laughable bits are when carrey s in the elevator singing i believe i can fly and the bit when he ties up someone in a robbery and is speaking with a voice changer he sounds like a crap robot okay 
this is a clever story about relationships and a display of three main categories of players in the game of relationships playboys max manipulative women alice and the fools who may be indeed in love lisa muriel and lucien max and alice are very unlikeable and perhaps despicable characters but who are always in control in the game leaving their partners around in the dark but as the profusely discussed ending tells us as veteran players as max and alice were they would be happy to part ways anytime they see fit as if the game was just announced to be over and each one of them could not care less to get on with his or her own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented itself lisa muriel and lucien might be the ones who felt like investing something real in a relationship only not being able to realise that they were the baits in the game and the ultimate losers as far as what we were shown is concerned who knows if they are also advance players of some sort in their worlds not shown to us on screen this is a very fast paced delicately crafted and seductively witty story with an enticing execution by the cast it also deserves some deeper thinking how much is real in a game of relationship 
i first saw this in the s on syndicated tv and admired its production values which were high tech for the time the remastered video is rich and colorful far more intense then the pale mm tv prints this movie deserves more attention it paved the way for ufo space and even star wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly conceived gadgets sure the story of an alternative anti matter planet earth has been recycled a hundred times since star trek but the beauty of this film is its self conscious european flair for design from the rolls royce space engines to the euro sec letterhead business paper jfss or dopplegangers as it was called in europe is enjoyable for the imaginary vision of europe in space in the shadow of the superpowers gerry and sylvia anderson s ambitious epic gets a little tedious when the american astronaut finally realizes that he is on the doppleganger earth and everything is literally downhill after the poetically graceful shuttle boarding sequence a mediocre story is helped along by a grand and lyrical classical score by the late great barry gray the john williams of britain 
if western union isn t exactly the real story of the construction of the transcontinental telegraph it certainly does capture the spirit and dedication of the people involved with the project dean jagger is the man in charge and one fine day he s thrown from a horse and sustains some fractured ribs an outlaw on the run randolph scott finds jagger and is ready to steal his horse but changes his mind and brings jagger to help later on he s hired by western union and works for jagger jagger also hires a young easterner played by robert young who s an engineer young is doing one of his few loan out films away from mgm for th century fox both young and scott become friends but rivals for jagger s sister virginia gilmore western union has plenty of action enough to satisfy any western fans the telegraph crew has to deal with outlaws indians and your garden variety labor troubles slim summerville as the timid cook and victor killian as the frontier character assigned to guard him have some of the funniest scenes they both provide some good comic relief fritz lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving briskly along western union is solid western entertainment 
this isn t among my favorite hitchcock films though i must admit it s still pretty good among the things i really liked were the presence of jimmy stewart he always improves even the most mediocre material and the incredibly scary looking assassin who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him although it cost the studio a lot of money i didn t particularly care for doris day in the film she seemed to weep a lot and belts out que sera like a fullback yes i know that she was supposed to sing in that manner but this forever made me hate this song sorry the other complaint though minor i had about the movie was that it was a little too polished and hollywood esque the original version also done by hitchcock just seemed a lot grittier and seedier and this added to the scary ambiance 
have you ever read a book then seen the movie and wonder how did they screw it up so bad this is one of those the book by huffaker nobody likes a drunken indian was great riotously funny this movie is not it seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we cared about the characters this movie which touches on some real concerns about indians makes you wonder why we haven t seen more comedies about the holocaust or slavery not well done 
when i see a movie i usually seek entertainment but of course if i know what genre the move is then i will seek what it is meant to do for example if it is a deep film i expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying but who s that girl is not a deep film but it is entertaining nonetheless it s a campy sort of film that s a joy to watch there s barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts i ve watched it when i was younger the cast is always entertaining as usual i had a small crush on griffin dunne even though he wasn t the typical male heartthrob at the time haviland morris also stars and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too overall a delight 
the prey has an interesting history unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in june of you might have caught it on the movie channel back in summer but little else is remembered the plot is your basic killer in the woods again but ironically this was filmed before friday the th the prey was actually shot sometime in according to one of the actors in an interview years later but released for about a week at some drive ins yes jim namans drive in showed this in june of but it has a dated look to it maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by now on the story it has some kind of back story a forest fire back in the s leaves a lot of gypsies burned to death but one of their children survive our monster so flash forward to present day which would be we have an older middle age couple camping only to be dispatched by the monster the tag line for this picture claims its not human and its got an axe but an axe was only used in these first two killings now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid s camping we all know they are the prey and the monster knocks them of one by one for an minute movie it seems longer we also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the mins overall for being out into an s horror movie it looks way more s than ever hey the prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short it does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end and we have to wait till the last minutes to see him side note the monster has gone on to star in the addams family movies in the s 
seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release i don t quite get it why has this been such a huge hit in its amateurishness drips from every scene the jokes are lame and predictable the sex scenes are exploitative and over the top that is not to say that miss rudnik does not have nice boobs the singing is schrecklich the only genuinely funny scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing a trait that dates the movie firmly to the mid eighties it s really quite puzzling to me how incapable i am to grasp what evoked the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in and apparently still today reading my fellow imdbers comments 
beyond the clouds is in many ways the weirdest film i have ever seen not for its cult appeal gore or even for its ideas but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema beyond the clouds was directed by michelangelo antonioni one of italy s most famous directors however if you gave this film only a quick watch over passively i mean it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances this movie deserves great attention to the point of embracing all its cheese by cheese i don t mean a slice but a whole brick of cheddar the music seems like it s from some italian porno the story and dialogue like they are from a corny japanese soap and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head but once you get passed all this you are engaged in an existential work of art the cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention perfectly to what needs to be known the basic plot is of four chapters unrelated and all about love what we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said people cannot communicate to each other instead they can only communicate through each other i suppose that s why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people s reaction overly melodramatic i left that film thinking to myself maybe all life is one big melodrama we judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful i hate because i have reason but what does the hated think maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary in other words melodramatic so melodrama is actually an existential function a corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do this is a great film i recommend it to all 
if you are looking for a movie that doesn t take itself seriously than haggard is for you i must say before i write anything more that if you have not seen any of the cky camp kill yourself videos than the movie most likely won t be as funny my advice is to watch a few clips of those videos that bam and his friends made haggard does not take itself seriously at all and that was never the purpose throughout the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot which may get annoying but its nothing that is out of control even through all that the plot does stay focused and the story of ryan dunn s character does unfold quite nicely this plot i have been told is based off a true story for the most part of ryan dunn s ex girlfriend brandon dicamillo is by far the best character in the movie he has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh he stole the movie if you ask me overall i love this movie for its simplicity and straight up weirdness its a bam movie people its not going to be normal haggard is filled with hilarious quotes that my friends and i constantly used since the first time we saw it i ve seen the movie times and still find new things every time the soundtrack is just as good everything from gnar kill to new order and some techno just don t go into the movie with high expectations let it all unfold and then judge it for what it is 
the plot of the movie is pretty simple a viral outbreak turned the population into flesh eating zombies those who left became hunters well first of all this is not the worst zombie movie there is among the worst are zombiez and the infamous zombie lake in fact i think the idea for quick and the undead was very good just executed poorly considering the budget they had to work with this movie looks very good i wasn t bored at all while watching it special effects were solid although they did use cgi once fat zombie getting shot in the head but everything else gore guts was rather good acting is awful however our main guy looks like young clint eastwood other actors are not even worth mentioning as far as the plot goes they didn t work enough on the development of the story bad acting low budget good special effects idea for the movie overall this flick deserves from me it s not as bad as people say imagine a zombie western then watch this movie 
after watching tipping the velvet by sarah waters i decided to watch fingersmith the characters were just as good in both performances though missing rachael stirling in the adaptation of fingersmith the story line overall was of a good choice the twisting and the unravelling of the characters were amazing excellent watch only missing rachael stirling if you do enjoy the romance of two girls this isn t one of the best films to watch it takes on a different spin from tipping the velvet but just as good would recommend it to everyone 
i had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci fi network it reminded me of the irwin allen tv series of the late s time tunnel etc excellent effects they beat star trek done years later but then that wasn t very hard to accomplish i found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production they would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters level but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro politics surprisingly similar to today s european union the plot is indeed reminiscent of twilight zone in general as other users have pointed but in this case it s a compliment great sets by the way 
 or better yet watch fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick rolling kansas sounded promising in fact the program guide gave it out of stars which usually means it s fairly watchable but i pretty much fast forwarded through it usually road trip movies have great music but i can t even recall whether there was music the only high point was a small role with rip torn as a wise old hitchhiker guru otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way the four main characters are unknown actors and i don t remember seeing any of them in another movie oh yeah i see that thos hayden church was in it but he s in everything good bad or indifferent this movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you re not 
killer flood the day the damn broke finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof even by the low standards of disaster movies excuse me allow me to correct myself even by the low standards of made for tv disaster movies this is truly awful where do i begin the dam modeler may have once seen a photo of a dam but i doubt it most dams especially large ones that generate electricity have oh i don t know a power plant nearby some sluice gates for water to run through heck even a high tension electrical wire or two the dam is also somewhat understaffed two count them two employees staff the entire dam all three shifts and the employees were apparently imported from a clich d ridden world war two film as they heroically and rather needlessly have long eulogized death scenes complete with photos of grandchildrenn floating by heck one of them manages to get shot by the dam itself in a way that defies description the special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on photo s of the town in a method that makes a sixties godzilla film look like the matrix a three year old drawing with a blue crayon on the film stock would have yielded better results since the disaster money shots are worthless how is the rest of the film needless to say the script and acting follow the special effects lead this is no diamond in the rough this is the rough so is it a guilty pleasure killer flood is awful enough to generate some laughs and the film itself has that earnest incompetence that makes a good cult classic but bad disaster films need to age like a fine wine avalanche the swarm meteor it is also doubtful that michelle green hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever will ever match the great henry fonda being pelted by raisins that are supposed to be killer bees check back with me in 
tipping the velvet has just three weeks ago been released in the uk and already i watch as countless letters flood to the national papers and tv guides claiming that it possesses a thin plot weak performances and an even weaker script you find me incensed this is heresy i would really like to dispel all doubt by first congratulating andrew davies on enabling geoffrey sax to create this wonderful dramatization of sarah waters novel by cushioning him with such a fantastic script kudos but i fear i must now change tack i saw one of the premiere tv guides here in the uk which shall remain nameless relentlessly describing tipping the velvet as a lesbian love story if they are and i assume they are trying to promote interest in the film then this is completely the wrong way to go about it aside from the phrase being a disappointingly inaccurate description by saying such a thing they are either a turning away those who would instinctively be repelled by that subject matter or b attracting a class of people who will only watch to see some serious girl on girl action buy a video through this display of serious inconsideration this and other magazines are cheapening what is a brilliant adaptation of one of recent literature s greatest works tipping the velvet is a story of love of passion of moving on of loss and of heartbreak it s not a lesbian love story no siree the end result is a stylish affair with excellent performances all round particularly from stirling hawes chancellor and may direction wise it s intoxicating and immersive sometimes fast paced sometimes not but it never ceases to be anything less than compelling as a whole it s polished and well delivered the sex is undertaken with tenderness and delicacy and although many will not class it as a real film it will remain among my favourites for some time to come 
this series and elon gold were being hyped as the next big thing in sitcoms for nbc well they weren t dennis farina was terribly miscast as the father in law he just seemed so uncomfortable and out of place here the term private convo time was supposed to become the dyno mite catch phrase of the st century well it wasn t people were asking then as they still are today when his name comes up who the hell is elon gold i saw him on an episode of the mentalist this evening i mentioned his name and my girlfriend asked who not funny total waste of airtime nbc had really high hopes for this show but it just fell flat 
this story is about a safari in africa that meets some guy named trent who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babes naturally they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men the rest is pretty predictable this movie has everything you d expect in a bargain basement movie about africa the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage film of animals that are not native to the continent such as orangutans moose coatamundis and ground hogs a white actor in dark makeup playing a native bad acting particularly from trent a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood comic relief sounding like chico marx a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikini clad white women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors like a tribe of angry female tarzans by the look of it my assumption is that the movie was made for under including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit but what i didn t expect was an imdb score of this is poor but not that poor considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense and there is no conceivable reason why the film is rated that high now i am not saying the film isn t worth seeing it s campy and stupid enough to make enjoyable viewing particularly with friends just don t expect anything resembling a professionally made or competent film finally here s a smattering of the dialog from this jungle classic oolama like strong white man oolama want strong white man oonga bunga me te tonga no keeel kill man 
did people expect jurassic park to be full of surprises not one moment of it is worth it many elements could easily scare people out of the movies and it s not the dinos tea leoni i think she s a great actress but i m sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line i wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie laura dern she s ok but why not be more noticeable in the movie maybe exchange smart dialogs with sam neil alessandro nivola have you ever heard of something called facial expression fellings emotions he s got to work harder on that sam neil no big deal the soundtrack got to change that record or you get tired of it my applause goes to william h macy a talented actor who i ve never seen playing a bad role unfortunately he can t save the movie nor can the well computer created dinosaurs 
i must preface this comment with a sort of admission i suppose i just have a soft spot for the original s s tv series i think the filmmakers here blew it from the get go as far as casting in a supposed remake audiences would look for reflections of the hip athletic linc clarence williams iii or the cool with it michael cole and so forth instead we get giovanni ribisi as a poor little white rich boy who comes off as just pathetic like he is in all his roles in the office i used to work in i amused myself once by creating a fake movie poster casting various actors as members of the office staff guess who i cast as the dorky son of the company president danes does ok as the new julie but none of the characters have much to do as the story just sort of sits there mired in conventionality so it s quite forgettable besides what was i talking about 
 points for take on probably what really kinda maybe more what it was like back then american indians probably stole more than killed who really knows nice slower odd pursuit means it has a pace and interesting and unique thankfully not another mindless shoot em up i thought this would suck at first i wound up getting wrapped up nice treasure good job i have hopes nobody dissects this film when the entire movie unfolds you have many unique twists impossible to determine what will be next the characters are human and have either honor or not passion or not forgiveness or not wound up loving the white horse the indian sheen even the damned desert all good 
the acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play the story is full of holes and gaps and skips around so you have no idea as to what just happened half the scenes are pointless there is not an inkling of character development the score soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about of the scenes i m glad i only rented the movie yet i still feel cheated avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances it seems like the bulk of the budget was spent on putting a few name brand actors in this less than bad film this movie is equivalent to visiting a strip club it tries to get you excited and interested but just as you think something is going to happen your thrown into some unrelated scene and left trying to figure out how you arrived there 
make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season if you admire dennis morgan or barbara stanwyck this film is a fun one to watch they really work well together as you would see in this movie the whole cast was very entertaining since i m a dennis morgan fan this film was a real treat but everyone can enjoy it recommended 
nynke is a classy filmed movie in the same style as the oscar winning film character but this comparison immediately urges me to add that the latter was quite more exciting sure nynke is a beautiful historic costume drama with fantastic acting by monic hendrickx in which you witness the personal growth of nynke van hichtum in her marriage to pieter jelles troelstra the subtitle of this movie is a lovestory so it starts and ends with their marriage but that is where the director makes a crucial mistake nynke s exciting independent life started when the marriage ended she wrote several children s books and travelled around the world what a great life she has lived but pieter verhoeff puts nynke back in the trammels of convention that depressed her and that she struggled out of the thought that her life extended just her marriage to troelstra being no one else but the mother of their kids let s all hope for nynke ii 
another indian legend you never heard of before is let loose as the name implies this is a vengeful wraith who likes to absorb the skeletons of people while they re still using them as usual ancient burial grounds can you say poltergeist have been disturbed by clich d greedy land developers building stuff the cgi if it had been better might have made the effect more treacherous looking but they skimped on the budget and it shows to comical effect the unleashed creature probably should have been kept off stage during its first several killings that might have added some mystery or impending doom atmosphere but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looks like and it wasn t impressive the deaths are just poorly done again with shoddy cgi i guess ancient spirits always kill by using cheap special effects as for the victims they look they re going to laugh any moment while they do goofy screams it s always obvious who s going to get it a character with only a few lines shows up strange noises are heard cgi dots fly exit character repeat several times still there s a few chase scenes featuring the monster that actually made this thing watchable unfortunately the director seems to be using these as a device to fall back on so it s used too often when he can t think of anything else for his characters to do overall it s pretty silly but i ve seen worse this flick is cheap but it s oddly fun to watch 
we found this movie nearly impossible to watch with such a super cast it s a shame that the writing and direction were so awful the excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening the flash backs were clumsy the characters were one dimensional the heavy handed metaphors the river the cat were repeated way too often the movie nobody s fool based on another novel by russo was infinitely better probably because it was more tightly written and directed the photography in empire falls was lovely too bad it wasn t a travelogue i read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some quibbles with the novel itself i would give the novel out of stars perhaps the screenwriters and director were so awed by the novel s reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie this was supposed to be a television movie guys not books on tape 
first of all i hate those moronic rappers who could nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like clich e version of gangsters the movie doesn t take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we re already at the warehouse there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie except for the homeless guy who is also the only one with half a brain bill paxton and william sadler are both hill billies and sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters i did nt like him right from the start the movie is filled with pointless violence and walter hills specialty people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no one everybody dies except from paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve the only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but they re actors by profession not annoying ugly brain dead rappers stay away from this crap and watch hours and instead at lest they have characters you care about a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast 
doe eyed high school student kathleen beller is found beaten and raped in the opening scenes of this made for tv movie the film then flashbacks to the few days before the rape as beller is harassed by a stranger beller and scott colomby and her best friend robin mattson and dennis quaid are double dating early on beller s anxious parents laid back tony bill and shrill blythe danner wait at home wringing hands and so on right away the s makes its dated entrance as the young couples discuss the romance and love in three days of the condor beller an amateur photographer begins getting threatening notes stuffed in her locker at school the film makers wisely give us a whole slew of suspects beller s new boyfriend mattson s boyfriend beller s dad beller s ex boyfriend and what about that overly friendly photography class teacher who wants beller to be a little more sexy in her self portraits i knew who the rapist was because the worldvision video company video box has a picture of the attack on the back cover destroying any suspense in that regard without giving away who the attacker is beller begins getting harassing phone calls and is eventually raped the movie then heads south as she makes like nancy drew and secretly sets up a time lapse camera to catch the guy stalking another student finally the film makers tack on a hokey ending narration from beller about the lack of understanding for the victims of rape in that day and age the suspense here is very real without going over the top into scary movie stuff beller is very good and watch for her and mattson s scene in an abandoned theater both do great jobs the film is full of familiar faces including ellen travolta in a small role and everyone is professional this was made in and it shows i am sure no one had any idea that this would be reviewed in by an overcritical horror movie lover who needs to get to bed and be up early in the morning but some of the attitudes here are embarassing the teacher who tells beller to be sexy is never made to explain what exactly he had in mind nowadays if any high school teacher said that then that would have been a made for tv movie on its own after beller is raped the rapist is still a part of her life as warrants are issued blah blah blah there may not be a case because beller is not a virgin and cannot prove she was raped by whom she said many of these problems have been addressed with modern technology and policing efforts but this film obviously knew it would have a chance to add to the reform debate rape is an act of violence that has not gone away but efforts today to catch the attackers are miles ahead of twenty four years ago the problem is the anti rape angle feels tacked on like an afterthought before that we have a tight little suspenser that has real honest to god characterization after the rape everything changes filmwise and not for the better i remember beller from the s and s and who could forget her revealing role in the betsy but she has not done anything in almost ten years this is a shame since she was very good way back then i will recommend are you in the house alone based on the acting alone with a reluctant nod to at least the first two thirds of the film if you want to relive s made for tv high school life this is your cup of tab this is unrated but contains physical violence some sexual violence and some adult situations 
this movie really sucks this is my second review because its so bad the girl on the cover is hot but the girl in the movie is not i cant believe it was rated r there is basiaclly no violence no sex no nudity no swearing nothing really crap film 
i agree with andy this is a good movie kevin mckidd s character is believable throughout the film we re forced to hate him and latterly sympathise with him paula sage who plays roberta puts in a good performance too it s thought provoking and emotive without any slush over production credit to director alison peebles and writer andrea gibb for that a very worthwhile viewing the pace of the film is just right raising just enough interest in the subject matter to reel you in rather than bombard you with facts in a documentary style nice little soundtrack to go with the film too again used sparingly not to distract you from storyline recommended 
kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times he may have made more classics than anyone else he may have been a perfectionist but man was his first attempt ever bad kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map it looks like an ed wood film it has strange narration cheap shots bad dialogue ominous music reminiscent of your s sci fi horror flick and what looks like relatives of the cast of reefer madness going insane for no reason sure you can see an undeveloped kubrick in there it is a psychological horror study of war the characters became dehumanized and insane there are people playing more than one role there are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people and there are a few interesting shots around there but really this is a mess of course i am not discouraging you from watching it if you get a hold of it you are joining a select group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to it 
i couldn t relate to this film i m surprised that people are lauding it for being so realistic how many people at your school were victim to incest how many closet homosexual jocks were there how many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide hmmm ok you wouldn t know even if their were but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with and yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored but hey where s the entertainment in that with regards to the girl who committed suicide i found this to be exploitative i actually think many people in high school at some stage feel invisible ignored and unwanted but what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed the filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative and the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative i didn t buy it as a real life scenario and the problems of the other students i didn t fully relate to bullying is explored but that s been done to death we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person closet homosexuality pfft another clich gets rolled out thats the thing really too many clich s i guessed the ending at the start there was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense you ve got all these characters with explosive problems and one with apparently none and i thought what is the point of this character unless she s the unsuspecting suicide victim and surely enough one thing i will say and it is the saving grace of the film is that it does not glamourise suicide the suicide is very graphic and heart breaking to watch it is a powerful scene regardless of how contrived it is and one that dismisses suicide as the easy option but the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes not bad but certainly not groundbreaking or worthy of a minute standing ovation at cannes 
this is a wonderful movie i ve only seen it twice and i ve been looking for it again for ever i d buy it if i could find it while it s sad it shows three things how much a man can love a woman how hard some people want something and how hard people work to overcome their limitations 
stephane audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small danish community towards the end of the last century two beautiful and musically talented sisters give up their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to look after their ageing father one day a french woman babette comes to work for them after some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast which changes the lives of all those invited this is a film about human and cultural interaction reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from danish to french and especially between the dutiful sobriety of protestant northern europe and the sensuousness of the catholic south it is also about human needs and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses a profoundly uplifting film 
i have to differ from the other comments posted amid sporadic funny moments there are a lot of actors trying too hard to be funny the strain shows i watched this with two friends on another friend s recommendation none of us were thrilled 
and so it started with shreik a send up of horror films then we had scary movie a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre the illustrious send up however now we have scary movie scary movie scary movie scary movie date movie meet the spartans not another team movie plus many more genuinely funny movies marked with and super hero movie it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send ups funny using the rip offs from other movies in a funny way is all well and good if done properly but not many producers seem to know how to do that scary movie did it well the following sequels were then horrendous as the tried to over play the franchise but it was redeemed by scary movie not another teen movie was good because it used the spoofs well and to its credit i am sick of teen movies however this movie plays like a bad version of all of these it relies on slap stick the would make even the stooges cringe violating the image of stephen hawking and then when people begin to get bored and the producers knew when this would be we are treated to pamela anderson in a skin tight suit to conclude spoofs should be about making a homage like mock up of an original movie with an original storyline not plastering random take offs of legitimate film onto the storyline of a real film i shudder at the thought of sci fi movie and get my seppuku knife ready
sam firstenberg s ninja the domination mixes martial arts with the exorcist like horror the horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable but the film works as a mindless action martial arts flick the fight scenes are well choreographed and exciting and the film is never boring so forget stupid dialogue lame acting and annoying soundtrack grab some beer and check this one out highly recommended 
ok it was a risky move to rent this flick but i thought i had nothing to lose well i was wrong this is next to bloodsurf the worst horrormovie i have ever seen crappy actors crappy technical output crappy story and so on the soundtrack though isn t to bad that is why i give it a on the vote and not just a and of course the cats are a positive surprise by far the superior actors in this movie do not rent or buy it stay away from it and hope that this horrible horrible film will vanish to some obscure existence and not become a cult classic it most definitely do not deserve any recognition 
okay it features one lovely blink and you miss it joke when the dead are rising from their tombs the names of the old time horror directors like jacques tournier and jean yarborough are featured in the tombstones and the smashing of morally bankrupt repu con rightist villains is on target whorish skanks preaching morals etc but why these soldiers are anti republicans because they have gone to the war most of them should be republicans right why they don t go to killing the enemies who killed them or something why they all want to vote against the republicans why this story has made of a movie questions never answered 
there is nothing original humane or insightful in this film the acting is average images are amateurish the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic something close to a soap in a suicide is used to turn the film into a suspense drama we watch partly because we want to know who dies the various characters each have a problem and the film shows how bad each problem is for them but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key events there is never another way of seeing the events themselves so in the arseholes are arseholes the angels are angels this is simple stuff without this complexity the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence you hardly get to know the kids as much as the breasts bodies and limps that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation in the end if you know anything about film in the last years is just an immature rip off of elephant not a meditation not a progression yet while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy they never talk about gus van sant or elephant the positive posts on imdb curiously avoid any mention of this or simply don t value originality if you do want something with heart and voice avoid this piece of youth exploitation i was surprised by the filmmakers age when i found out after seeing this film i had assumed a year old had made it the twenty somethings i ve always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man 
some less than inspired opening string music notwithstanding we somehow know that from the word go this is heading straight for the big fun drawer by the time we observe monica dolan in a truly genius bit of casting delightfully goofing it up as cora early on we re already hooked but it is only later on when she reveals herself in her marvellous screen creation that deranged scheming maleficent queen of murder and deceit posing in the guise of the uptight miss gilchrist that she not only effortlessly steals the entire telemovie for herself but quite simply blows off screen anyone who comes near her including the ever well measured david suchet who himself seems to be somewhat bedazzled by her acting talents and very gentlemanly allows her to take centre stage dolan is the true engine of the film and her miss gilchrist a genuinely well rounded character in this christie rendition helped by a zesty script and the sprightly paced direction and also by the rest of the cast led by geraldine james and dominic jephcott who all display signs of sympathy for the given material and play with relish accordingly the production values are spot on as usual and if there are any weaker links they might be located in the comparatively substandard music score to the majority of later poirots and also perhaps in the lacking of a genuine italian born actor for the role of cora s husband other than that this is an hour and a half of pure televisual delight which is as self indulgent and entertaining as it is lovingly put together 
when the legends die is a powerful moving story of an orphaned ute indian who goes on to become tom black bull a champion bronc rider raised in the old ways tom is given a white man s name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world bitter about the role he has been forced into tom finds fulfillment doing one thing busting horses riding them to death in the rodeo the movie has richard widmark in the role of red the man who befriends tom and acts as his manager red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story which is about where the movie ends the real story is completely ignored the dark side of tom black bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas oh well you should read the book this movie doesn t come close to doing the story justice 
the material is poor the script s dreadful the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what the scene is supposed to be communicating like a kick in the head give this one a miss even yancy butlers not hot enough even in the semi nude scenes to save this tripe i m amazed people rave about yancy butler given what i ve seen here and in the couple of other things i ve seen her in she hasn t got the depth or presence to be a star and her off screen behaviour would tend to indicate she knows that as well last thing is where was this shot i don t recognise the externals 
fritz lang directed two great westerns western union and the return of frank james the frank james movie equals jesse james western union is one of randolph scott s great westerns i have never seen robert young in a western before he is terrific as the telegraph employee this is the only movie i can think of that is about the telegraph company opening up in the west it is a high geared story about the telegraph in the west a triangle love story and about loyalty the supporting cast is superb dean jagger who made a few westerns plays the telegraph manager virginia gilmore who plays mr jagger s sister is the love interest in the movie ms gilmore had a short career in movies she quit films in and became a drama coach she is primarily known as the first mrs yul brynner it is great to see slim summerville in a movie with mr scott again they were in two other great movies rebecca of sunnybrook farm and jesse james 
this is arguably the worst of the major ava gardner films yes she is gorgeous but that can wear thin over time especially after the corny and predictable movie ending in this turkey robert walker has to pretend that he s eddie bracken which surely embarrassed him olga san juan plays the jane powell golly gee part dick haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick and eve arden plays helen broderick and a host of other wise cracking female semi comedians yes the film contains a major popular song speak low but check out the other entirely forgettable pieces dick haymes sings very well of course and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for ava the sets are cheap the script is filled with clich s and failed humor and tom conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor as indeed he was in short if you want to see ava in her prime buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie 
i totally loved this movie tried to buy it and can t find it a must see a movie you can watch again and again funny but also a tear jerker in one really good album for the movie it s a really good s movie i wish i could find a copy to buy this movie cause i would the actors in it acted really good there s a lot of people out there that probably could relate to this movie that s what makes this movie so good so go out and try to rent this one you won t regret it it s an older movie but it s worth watching i would not be surprised if they made a remake of this movie soon but i m sure it would not be the same anyone who hasn t seen it go rent it 
this woman is a terrible comedian she can t crack a joke she has no real character this is another example of typical american rubbish that people laugh at because they have no idea how to react so they say to themselves well it s a comedy show so i ll laugh i guess i cannot stand this miserable woman and her pi poor excuse for comedy she does not deserve anything but booing why can t america dump this kind of turdish delight and go for something that actually contains humour she is not funny not at all why oh why does even one person like this idiot 
the kite runner began as one of those important films that most people fawn over because they are told that they should if they want to be among the elite and quickly descended into an idiotic film of absurdly outlandish proportions i ve never read the book and never felt the need because i honestly don t care sure i m called uninformed for saying it but i truly have no interest whatsoever in just another pull at your heartstrings copy off of all other story lines to get emotion from the readers novel even if it is set in afghanistan that said i watched the movie i heard good things about its beauty and how touching it was and decided why not as it turns out there was a very good reason why not not only was the so called main character completely unsympathetic i get it he was young and this is a film about redemption but honestly he was horrible i hated him and not in that good anti hero way he was just a dull idiotic self absorbed character that i felt nothing towards but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that i couldn t believe how everyone else was fawning over how beautiful it was and how they cried and it moved them i m sorry but i only feel moved by something that feels realistic sci fi has been known to move me fantasy as well but this please this surpassed many other movies for pure absurdity my biggest peeve hassan was amir s brother really you sure you didn t just rip that off from a thousand other stories positive that that particular tidbit wasn t just added in to try to pull more tears out of your audiences y know the type of people who look for reasons to cry during a movie i was rolling my eyes when that twist was revealed knowing that it could only go downhill from there not to mention flashing back to star wars amir hassan is your brother nooooo that s not true that s impossible oh and it certainly did filled to the brim with clich s and just plan dumb storytelling like good guy miraculously escapes bad guy against all odds with help from spunky kid who despite being viciously sodomized and having no clue who you are is willing to help out with a conveniently placed weapon that holds special meaning to you ooh and don t forget the oh so idiotic finally getting vengeance on the kid who teased you when you were little who surprise surprise has turned into a psychopathic adult trust me guys i understand you like to live vicariously through movies but that ll never happen you know that kid who teased you in high school he s no terrorist he s probably an accountant oh and i must mention the cgi tastic kites i think those were on par with the matrix movies and transformers bravo you guys bravo it seems this movie was just made for western audiences who need to a reason to care about the middle east hey an overly emotional friendship story will work this is one of the most shallow movies i ve had the misfortune of seeing it poses as deep well but when you get right down to it it s nothing special unfortunately the core of america s audience will do what they re told and follow the it s about controversial material so it must be good way of thinking 
you know this is one of those emperor s new clothes films it s like so off the wall and strange that you re supposed to like it if you re really into film well i think that s a bunch of bologna films like this which hide under the cloak of dada or surrealism make me nuts some person has this bad dream perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed remembers most of it unfortunately and then puts it on film and we re all supposed to marvel at their creative genius i have bizarre dreams too sometimes that make absolutely no sense but i don t feel the need to put them on film expose everybody else to them and call it art weirdness does not in of itself mean something is interesting true dada or surrealistic expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it if other people don t get it that doesn t make it profound it just makes it incomprehensible bizarreness for bizarreness sake for me is not good let alone great art and comparing tuvalu to delicatesen is like comparing the godfather i ii to the godfather iii same genre not in the same league 
aya if you are looking for special effects that are years before its time this is it the glowing lightning bolts fireballs etc look like they came from a cheesy s sci fi flick and yes hercules really grows he s not being pushed on a cart closer to the camera 
favela rising is a documentary about the slums of rio the favelas specifically the most violent one vig rio geral according to this film a lot more kids have died violently in rio s favelas over the last decade or so than in israel palestine during the same period a fact astonishing if true which shows how under recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world this is an important topic especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to marshal the neediest and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program this is a compelling documentary if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personality based version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examined drug lords rule in the favelas and gun toting teenage boys are the main drug dealers like in parts of colombia fernando meirelles movie city of god cidade de deus has been accused of celebrating violence cidade de deus is another of rio s many favelas but the early section of favela rising shows that in fact favela boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are it s cool to carry a gun there cool to work as a drug trafficker it s fifty times more profitable than the earnings available by other means mochary first discovered the afroreggae movement and its leaders anderson s and jos junior while visiting rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor zimbalist to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to fund it s s eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator but like the favelas themselves the film teems with other people no doubt about the fact that s is a remarkable leader organizer and artist vig rio geral is compared to bosnia shooting there was very dangerous anderson s s friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting enabled the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while mostly there were close calls avoiding any serious confrontations with drug lords or drug dealing cops they also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home that resulted in of the footage including rare shots of violent incidents including police beatings it s hard for an outsider to keep track of police massacres in rio there was one in the early s that looms over the story and inspired s who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement the cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody doesn t like that the ill trained police paramilitaries come in often wearing black ski masks and shoot up a neighborhood killing a lot of innocents this is pretty much the picture we get in meirelles city of god except that this time s junior and the other guys come in starting in vig rio geral but spreading out eventually to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth girls as well as boys their afroreggae grupo cultural afroreggae or gcar program formed in is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the rio ghettos it leads them to leave behind smoking alcohol and drugs that s the rule to explode into rap song percussion and gymnastics in expressive galvanic performances eventually the best of the performers led by s wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers and their banda afroreggae has an international recording contract other centers and groups have been created by or through the gcar over the years in vig rio geral and other favelas to seek the betterment of youth by providing training and staging performances of music capoeira theater hiphop and dance at gcar centers the performance arts aren t everything just the focal point gcar is also a movement for broader social change gathering public awareness through such performances the centers also provide training in information newspaper radio internet e mail links hygiene and sex education to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor black and white and to offer workshops in audio visual work including production of documentaries the program is currently active in four other favelas there are many scenes of favela street and home life in favela rising and they look very much like the images in city of god with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very very much more positive not that it isn t an uphill battle and the corruption of the police the inequities of the social system and the indifference of the general population of brazil are not directly addressed by any of this but there s a scene where s talks to some young kids in another favela cynical boys not enthusiastic about afroreggae and determined to work in the drug trade as s himself did as a boy s doesn t seem to be convincing any of them despite pointing out that traffickers don t make it to the age of fifty but we learn that the most negative boy in this group richard morales joined the movement five months later there s also the account of a freak accident that disabled s but with a positive outcome it would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story were edited down a little but this is vibrant inspiring material and represents committed risk taking documentary film making and it s nice that favela rising has been included in seven film festivals and won a number of awards including best new documentary filmmaker at the tribeca film festival it s currently being shown at the institute of contemporary arts ica in london however a wide art house audience in the us seems somewhat unlikely included in the sfiff 
i first played this around or when i was with my friends i thought the game was really great and loved it the game is simple on one player mode you go around as james bond and complete missions in different places like an arctic wasteland or a city my favorite was one with a tank on two player mode you and a friend choose from any character you wish and go all out with a fight through out the area you are in you will find ammo and weapons to help from hand guns to rifles to lasers and even your fists work again with player two mode there are lots of places to go and some to unlock i find this game really fun but also very suspenseful because you never really know where your opponent is and it s surprising to see them behind a door where you are going this game gets stars or of very good go play it sometime 
it s my friends a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology so why can t we see a movie that s a little more thought out than this cheesy low budget film i ve seen a lot of low budget movies that rock my socks off but this one it s almost as if it s trying to be horrible just don t watch it i can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good i feel like a small child produced this entire movie there s not even an original plot line vampire assassins in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself can someone tell me if perhaps this was designed as a comedy movie and i just didn t know it it makes me wonder what does the sequel have in store for us who so loved the first installment 
upon a recommendation from a friend and my admiration of philip baker hall i rented the first season disc of the loop it s a typical tv comedy with all the clich s that the genre employs with the wacky scheming brother sully ditzy blonde lizzy token unrequited love interest piper sarcastic asian helper darcy which reminded me of arliss as if anyone needed to be reminded of that show the plot deals with various bad luck usually by sully that befalls sam that puts his job at the airplane in jeopardy only to have him save the day with hilarious hijinks ensuing in the middle i didn t descibe a certain episode i described them all to a t therein lies the problem as what seems like it might even be passable entertainment at first just gets uselessly stale when watching episodes in a row and growing bored beyond belief at the endless repetition sully will do something wacky mimi rogers will say something overtly sexual russ will tell about his gay son darcy will do her impersonation of sandra oh on arliss blah blah blah blah blah the only positive is the lack of an annoying laugh track but don t let that fool you into thinking it s any good go watch a far better comedy arrested development always sunny in phillidelphia two name two off the top of my head surprised that this one is still on the air oh that s right fox only cancels the good shows i forgot needless to say i don t trust my friend s taste in shows anymore my grade d 
this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the cast is an international one australian pretending to be british stage american and a character with an english name sporting an unrecognizable european accent what passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity so short were the shoestrings of this film s budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition in the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and stalk n slash thrillers of extraordinary though not necessarily high quality which have been made on no budget at all recent examples include the poorly made but totally scary blair witch project and of course the most recent that low budget winner saw featuring practically unknown leads gary elwes is just someone you don t remember even if you have seen him before in darkhunters it is shocking to find a known character actor dominique pinon and hollywood has been jeff fahey struggling valiantly to save the film it is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man fahey in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines i would have rated this film out of had that been possible 
first of all since i m one of the people who never saw the mst k chopped up version of this movie i can t comment on that however i did see the original version of this movie on the sci fi channel and i thought it was just as good as anything else on that channel in fact i thought it was one of their better offerings i ve noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about soultaker with a modicum of intelligence thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this movie and rightly so in it s original cut most reasonable people i think would probably rate it at least or stars out of five is average to me and i think this movie is about average for a sci fi pic in contrast to the above i ve also noticed that the reviewers who seem immature dull and flip and as a result come off as boneheads from where i stand are the same ones who can t find anything good about this movie and basically trash it without cause based mostly on seeing it chopped up and fricasseed on mst k or if they have seen both cuts it seems they were greatly prejudiced by the mst k viewing to begin with 
director and auteur jean pierre rappenau was years old during the spring of as france s third republic disintegrated in a matter of a few weeks it was a time he says when all the adults were a little bit insane he and the production staff have lovingly and meticulously recreated that world in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional the structure a classic farce is ideal for the period as multiple plot lines zip and intersect only to come together in a logical satisfying conclusion the peg for this plot is frederic played by brilliant newcomer gregory derangere who is fully up to playing opposite adjani depardieu and ledoyen the real strength of the film is in its supporting performances m rappeneau has cast the film exquisitely with actors who volunteered ideas for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with just two short sentences of dialogue though not yet as widely influential as renoir s rules of the game bon voyage richly deserves to be a companion piece to that classic though it demands a lot of the audience it gives much back one of its demands is tolerance for a certain coyness and misdirection as to the exact genre we are watching a crime melodrama no a spy thriller ah a romantic comedy recommend it to cinemaphile friends just be sure to let them discover for themselves that it is a romantic comedy 
me being from australia and loving the series i wasn t expecting much from the american version of kath and kim but i thought i d watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad well whats there to say its nothing special selma blair is ok as kim and actually had a few good lines molly shannon is not a good kath though the good thing about jane turner s kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accents such as when she says yumor or noice it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks but when shannon has a go at the accent its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as turner and the show really misses sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about because the kal and craig characters in this version are really not funny so far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the aussie version although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name not being compared to the aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better but if there is nothing else to do on a sunday night or thursday night in america then you cant do much harm in watching it or better put on some of the aussie version if you ve got it 
i was surprised how much i enjoyed this sure it is a bit slow moving in parts but what else would one expect from rollin also there is plenty of nudity nothing wrong with that particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous brigitte lahaie there are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead bit more dodgey perhaps but most effective there is also a sci fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end but i wouldn t bother too much with that no here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still alive without memory my dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films there is some similarity here particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller it is a captivating nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations including a stunning railway setting at the end 
this film has some flaws and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening possibly the greatest film to show the direness within fly over country rolling kansas is a film in which nothing happens and you don t care about anybody like life it starts it moves and then it ends a few attempts at humor are made but everything falls very flat the occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance do yourself a favor and go see a good movie this is free and repeatedly frequently on comedy central because nobody went to see it nobody wants to see it and it s marginally better than dead air not to damn with faint praise but the movie s one rock song is worth listening to too bad the movie isn t worth watching 
he s the only reason to see this film he gives a very good performance much better than this crap deserves he s very handsome and very talented he deserves better than this also depressing is to see malcolm mcdowell in this he s another talented actor who deserves better but like esai he gives a very good performance so if you re fans of either of them you might want to watch otherwise stay away one more complaint couldn t we have had more scenes of esai shirtless 
this was the very first movie i ever saw in my life back in or i was years old at the time and saw it at a drive in theatre i did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time i went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie after seeing it on the television along with two of my other favourite movies car wash my favourite movie and the wiz which seemed to come on every year about the same time all together about times i knew that here was a movie that i would have as one of my favourites those three movies were the only live action shows that i could watch as a child i would not consider this to be a blaxploitation movie but rather an urban interest movie cochise and preach reminded me of some of my uncles especially the wild irish rose that they drank my mother also told me about some of the quarter parties that she attended and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar in nature to what occurred in real life if you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who hasn t seen this movie yet then i recommend that you buy the dvd right now i m glad that i was around to witness some of the goings on of the era 
i saw this movie for the first time just a short while ago if you ask me it does not get the credit it deserves it is a little like american pie meets fast times at ridgemont high but with more depth it handles the same issues as both movies but in a way that holds with it some grain of truth the ending is sad but that is how life is i think everyone should see it i have it on dvd form and it took such a long time to find it too that should say something heh and another thing i will add is that it is quite difficult finding the soundtrack i believe they stopped it but the soundtrack to this movie is amazing it has songs by artists like the commodores u devo reo speedwagon the cars kc and the sunshine band and many more 
this is halfway to being a top movie the opening section which spoofs hollywood social message films is absolutely brilliant it is a riot from start to finish the second section which introduces us to the main characters of the story is really great too we get a lot of great comic setups top notch performances and the dialog is really dynamic spoiler warning the one think that really annoyed me about this film though is the ending which i think contradicts everything that went before my interpretation was that this film was taking the mickey out all the silly prejudices and innuendo of small town gossip and national tabloid sensationalism i loved that the film was championing the cause that a person s sexuality is not determined by their hobbies idiosyncrasies fashion sense or whatever and then the ending goes and re enforces all the gossip and stereotypes that the movie successfully lampooned in the first place it turns out everyone was right godamit this was very disappointing to what was actually a great story 
not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted i will only say this nearly everybody says they loved curly best but i will put brideless groom up against any of other the stooges shorts i think it s the most hilarious from start to finish as well as being the most re watchable the off key singing student christine mcintire s cousin basil routine and of course emil sitka s j p are highlights but only around the stooges impeccable timing and the great writing too nuff said 
susan inadvertently stumbles onto a drug smuggling ring while her realtor gets a flat tire while driving her to see a house the leader of said drug ring mongo whom only has one week until retirement thinking she knows much more than this bubbly blond actually does seeks to make sure she won t tell anyone anything and thus begins one of the more bone headed films that i ve sat through all the actors in this film can t really act in the least susan makes a pretty ineffectual hero for most of the movie she d never escape multiple times if not for the fact that seemingly every one in the movie wants to have sex with her and she doesn t take the offensive until the last minutes of the flick when she does she spouts some generic i have had enough line preach on sister that very thought ran through my mind multiple times when i was watching this my grade d 
 what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog cheap sets and bad acting you would have galaxina this film came out when the original star wars proved there was a market for science fiction this in turn lead to some gems such as alien and a revitalized star trek unfortunately it also led to some bad movies and this was obviously one of them i say obviously because i hadn t even heard of this film until a few days ago i missed it when it came out in here s the underlying problem dorothy stratton couldn t act so for most of the movie they didn t even let her try i understand her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status but for the life of me i can t understand why clearly the movie tried to spoof star wars star trek and aliens but they clearly don t understand than when you spoof something it has to be funny this movie wasn t or at least the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny weren t science fiction is ripe for parody as spaceballs and galaxy quest proved this movie however did it poorly 
way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails these cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo a camel a monkey but no women this film tells of the hilarious misadventures of seven or so cavemen having burned their land with the new discovery of fire moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage along the way we get such great moments of comedy like a fat cavemen swallowing a frog that keeps croaking in his stomach a monkey throwing rocks at their heads a man swallowing a mouse to get the frog in his stomach the obligatory gay caveman the list could go on and on this movie is the very definition of cinematic dreck i was bored from the onset and it only got worse as the cavemen bobbled around hitting each other making poor jokes such as puns on the word perch hitting each other and mauling poor seta berger who looks like she lost a bet to a producer to appear in this nonsense she is indeed one of two bright spots in this film she isn t much of an actress so you have to guess why she is an ass et the other bright spot is the music as soon as i heard the score i said to myself that it sounded very familiar i had never heard the actual score but the music was unmistakably that of ennio morricone it s a nice score and the best thing in an otherwise crude boring lewd unimaginative and ridiculous film essentially about a group of moes finding a woman for the first time and first wanting to eat her like some animal being taught what she could do awwwwh sorry i m stifling a yawn as i relive the plot the end of the film has some or so mostly naked women on screen with all the erotic feel of pulling a scab off your knee this movie was painful to sit through and offers nothing of any real merit whatsoever the fact that it spawned a sequel doesn t surprise me as it offers that one thing which will prick viewer interest tail 
this movie gives daniel wu his chance to do a great action movie but i really find emil chow s character really great gutsy but determined to righting wrongs plus the main terrorist it gets me wondering his revolution makes me wonder if he is doing this for good or bad a movie that tells us about todd an amnesiac terrorist being tricked as an undercover until he learns who he really is the consequences that he makes from his terrorist family gives him a the choice of redemption purple storm was one of the best ones that i have seen this year the movie really stands out when it is filled with tremendous action scenes set up by stephen tung wai which won the best action sequences in the hong kong awards 
there s something going on in this film directed by x files scribe john shiban that has eluded me you get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems yet i feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward it s about perception there are characters the heroine nicole jaimie alexander meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish this might seem like a spoiler but it s something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers part they seem to be poking fun at us as we watch curious at whether we should trust what nicole is seeing or not it never gets a proper answer and i for one was a bit clueless at the point there comes a time in a film when ambiguity can just be frustrating because the viewer is led on a wild goose chase that ends at a dead end with little explanation at what we just saw it ultimately feels like an exhausting exercise instead of a thrilling psycho drama now there s nothing wrong with ambiguity itself but give us something to latch onto or you will evade us that s how i felt as i watched rest stop this film is supposedly about a young woman named nicole who decides to run off to california with lover jesse joey mendicino to make it big in hollywood they make what is supposed to be a slight detour at a rest stop so that nicole can pee but it descends into terror for her when she finds that her jesse is completely missing someone in a crusty dusty yellow truck is a nut job who seems to be causing a lot of trouble to nicole and we soon realize that he is behind jesse s disappearance when things start to occur signs provided to her if you will she will have to find a way out of a very difficult situation nicole is far from any existing town and with limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who provides her with some strong evidence of how evil he can be that s the easy part when a female character comes into play the film makes a really bizarre leap from logic as we are not sure where she ever came from how she got there and more importantly where she goes once nicole tries to break her free from her supposed prison in the restroom s utilities cabinet she meets another a police officer in the area joey lawrence who might seem like her savior but when he too is a victim of the truck driver startling things occur again that questions if he was ever actually even there to begin with the truck driver commits torturous acts to nicole like holing her up in the restroom and as she tries to untie a wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock she receives a nasty bite from him he then sets fire to the restroom leaving her without a lasting place of refuge from the beast it s the timing of the truck driver s attacks that has me listless perhaps he just likes tormenting her but he appropriately appears in certain situations where nicole has time to flee or prepare it doesn t make much sense his motives which propel the film into an illogical idea why does he make himself so obvious why does he allow her to prepare it seems i m going out on a limb here that he likes having his quarry believe they can find a way of escape only to stomp that hope out when he comes up with his next grisly attack yet why does shiban decide to play with the viewer by having nicole experience odd meetings with people that don t exist what is shiban and the writing team trying to say and to cap off the film s unhinged weirdness is a family in a rv they play a small part in the scheme of things as religious bigots themselves but the film doesn t do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film at all 
kramer vs kramer is one film to hold on too and not forget it isn t one of the most popular films ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best picture films but it does not mean it still isn t important i thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it the performances were the best positive for the film and dustin hoffman played one of his best roles he s ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son as his wife separates from him billy who is hoffman s son played another great performance along with meryl streep playing the depressed mother of billy kramer vs kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect but it succeeds in making the film worth watching and worth caring about it certainly one of hoffman s best films he s ever done i highly recommend it hedeen s outlook a 
this movie makes glitter look like schindler s list tarantino and the weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product green lighting a p o s like this regardless of the friendships involved is just bad business larry bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs writer director producer actor bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs a vanity project gone south hell ride allows usually good actors to chew the scenery at least when the camera isn t centered on bishop s feeble attempts to steal every scene he s in which is virtually every scene my final three words on hell ride are stink stank stunk 
dante would of been mortified if he knew that his masterpiece was being acted out puppets also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing no one really will care who the puppet was people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief by this dumb little movie this should be a crime and i cant believe you would ruin a book like that i thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed it totally ruins what your suppose to be getting from reading it your just making it a big joke 
i doubt if the real story of the development of western union would ever have gained a real audience instead of talking about the building of the telegraph system out west it was the story of board rooms dominated by one of the most interesting and disliked of the great robber barons jay gould gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant and part of his attempt at a national railway system to rival vanderbilt s but this while interesting is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the telegraph lines themselves at least that is how audiences would see it jay gould died in had he lived into the modern era and invested in hollywood he probably would have agreed to that assessment too the film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is endangered by indians spurred on by one jack slade barton maclane slade a desperado is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a crimp in his abilities to evade the police in the territories he is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the telegraph wires edward creighton dean jagger creighton s associate richard blake robert young and a quasi lawman vance shaw randolph scott who is slade s brother blake an easterner with little understanding of the west is romancing creighton s sister sue virginia gilmore but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings but he does become a close friend of shaw especially in trying to confront slade slade was a real western criminal by the way and the subject of a section of mark twain s roughing it he was hanged in the s but he did not have any involvement in stirring up indians against railroads or telegraph companies however maclane makes him a memorably evil and totally vicious type his killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance but lang is responsible for that as well as other touches look at the sequence with chill wills where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it he spits tobacco juice several times while talking to young who gets a little splattered then there is an indian attack which we watch from the ground level at the conclusion young suddenly gets splattered again but it s not brown but red that covers him he looks up at the pole s top and there is wills with an indian arrow through him it is an exciting film to watch and well worth catching 
i always wanted to see electra glide in blue for a very long time i ve always been intrigued by the title the star and the desert but for some now pretty clear reason this film is never shown on tv or i ve happen to miss it if it s ever shown well after watching the dvd i now know why the movie is rarely shown it s because it s not that good in fact i d say it s pretty much of a mess electra glide in blue was made by a first time director and it shows the film is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing holding it together more like a collection of short movies haphazardly strung together the movie can be boiled down to this intro murder cop and girlfriend together intro credits cops going to work crazy guy tells story cop finds dead body cop and chief and girlfriend at bar chase scene etc the scenes just don t flow together they re very distinctively independent from each other and because of this the characterization is weak borderline amateurish the scene at the bar with the girlfriend the scene at the farm with the hippies the scene with big john and the chief yelling at each other were cringe worthy i almost stopped the film during those awful moments the film maker s lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film the style like the s is all over the map the intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement then it tries to be a buddy film big john and zipper then a murder mystery then a melodramatic love story etc a film doesn t have to have one particular style in order to be successful but i m afraid the style in electra glide in blue was confused you can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with it the film is not a complete disaster while the content of electra glide in blue is almost amateurish the look of it is extremely and deceptively professional the cinematography is stunning every frame is worthy of an exhibition at an art gallery or because the first and last time director was involved in the music business worthy of an album cover the beautiful look of the film gives more credence to the finish product than it really deserves and thanks to robert blake s acting of a really badly written character the film maintains a certain level of realism even though nothing else makes much sense what s remarkable about the look and composition of the film is that it s been copied and duplicated a million times over the intro credits reminded me of something like top gun which was made years later scenes of johnny dressing up with his clothes on the bed reminded me of american gigolo strangely enough electra glide in blue has a very contemporary feel to it due to the stunning visuals even if the story and the philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated so electra glide in blue is on one hand a remarkably underrated and overlooked film because it obviously influenced a lot of future filmmakers out there when it comes to the look and composition very few films can claim to have achieved this and legendary cinematographer conrad hall should take full credit but on the other hand egib is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters confusing story and muddled direction none of which are worth of remembering 
unless you re interested in seeing hours worth of scenic mountain footage featuring hysterical characters lots of histrionics and cheap s gore not much of it either i would advise to avoid this movie it is long winded overlong and has a rather annoying amateurish feel to it masterpiece no an average thriller shot in an average fashion in a gorgeous italian landscape i m a huge fan of slow paced movies when there is a plot to delight and entertain you in this case it didn t work out for me the plot is trite interlaced with superficial and stereotypical characters backed by hilarious angry mobs and your typical italian widow dressed all in black sobbing if you are not acquainted and familiar with the italy country side the movie might be worth seeing as the scenery itself is spectacular and rather breathtaking this movie isn t however nothing out of the ordinary there are much better italian horror flicks than this not much else than a yawn fest 
if hollywood had the wellbeing of the audience at heart we would see films a year with the kind of wholesome fortitude that is behind this film there are several experiences of personal growth in this movie and while the characters are still very human even the lessons learned are not that greed will profit you or do unto others whatever you want as long as you are okay with it no this is what our sad desensitized lives need more sense more love more do unto others as you would have done unto you more hope thanks ursula this movie has an intelligent wit not yo mama cracks that run rampant in the so called comedies people need to feel good this movie will make you feel good and possibly inspire you to better your life and the lives of others sidenote every person counts in ticket sales this is a truly independent film if you want more quality films you have to support them 
 tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i ve seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father s home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she s prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you ve seen it s a hell of a puzzler 
i watched of this movie tonight and you may tell me that i need to see the whole movie to understand it but frankly i don t think so what the hell is the story in this movie i saw a lot of people running around in a factory shooting at everything around them where to start okay they were shooting around the place as if it was the terminator or something they were trying to kill the entire place is made of metal but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces no ricochet metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet magic bullets in one scene a bad guy is standing right in front of a good guy when another good guy pops out behind the bad guy and pumps him full of metal you see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist but the good guy right in front of him doesn t get hurt at all after having just splattered a human being all over the wall the two good guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft guns sound at one point the good guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm the lady screams out alarm in sector blah blah and the bad guy boss says okay this is not a drill blah blah in a very very amateur kinda way ooh we re getting ambushed by terrorists this isn t a drill but i m gonna sound like i don t give crap focus first you see the bad guys load up on weapons for some reason the same guy gets the same uzi twice deja vu or loop of scenes you literally see every single bad guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way the weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad guy extra no xx locks and loads when they started opening fire you had to see the barrel flashes boooring actors or dummies one of the presumed good guys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they re smoke blind or something so they don t see it coming they cough and moan as if it was anthrax in the grenade then a semi boss bad guy arrives and he doesn t even cough when he enters the smoke he just pushes the other bad guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isn t anthrax anyway b flick i think yeah a guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently i d like to see a guy fire a uzi with one hand and i d like to see him go get his hand afterwards extra bloody gore mess in a b flick kinda way small pops and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead though the first bullet hit his heart the good guy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy one of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip how stupid can you be always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies boring scenes like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building cut to the action if you re going for a b flick movie please my two cents on this movie 
this movie has to rank with welcome to the jungle and the hitcher and dream catcher for sheer god awfulness you ve got the most irritating heroine in gore history who spends most of her time sobbing and wailing and shrieking all the time in the most horrendous rest stop toilet ever put on film why she spends so much time in this ghastly bathroom from hell is never explained even when the usual killer truck driver is trying to murder her she refuses to leave the crapper when a motorcycle cop comes to her rescue the killer truck driver runs over the cop s legs while the heroine just looks on instead of grabbing his gun for protection she drags the poor slob into the crapper and locks the door then the cop orders her to blow his brains out because of the pain she does so while wailing and sobbing and keening and blows the back of his head off then the cop still alive beg her to shoot him again because he s still in pain he says this while the entire back of his head is all over the floor the sobbing wailing heroine shoots him again the movie goes on and on like this none of it making any sense the heroine is so dislikable you really want the killer to off her early on i saw this flick on the sci fi channel so it didn t cost me anything to watch but still i did watch out of sheer fascination as to how a movie could end up so terribly bad 
a blatant rip off of air bud this movie is really about parents worrying too much about parenting all the foibles of the characters eg adult coaches who dont know the game are taken to the extreme so much so that they are totally unbelievable not funny there is no semblance of reality here folks and you ll not develop sympathy for any of the characters the best thing about the movie is the good looking kits uniforms of the opposing team in the first game the dog plays perhaps chosen because the setting is supposedly near arlington heights il the home of the columbus crew s franchise player brian mcbride 
 electra glide in blue is a slow moving b flick in which blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes embroiled in a murder investigation a mediocre film at best eg in b features some members of the band chicago a whiff of action some philosophizing and lots and lots of boring dramatic filler not worth the time 
first and foremost i would like to say that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual someone that cared about others appreciated others found no barely any judgment against other people and this film has i think changed my life or viewpoint dramatically when i watched it i didn t know particularly what it was about i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship but other then that i was clueless and as i began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters i was in shock disbelief confusion and surprise the first time i watched it i was blind blind to their love to their intimacy to their connection to their pureness as human beings to their relationship i watched it a second time because i finally figured out how hypocritical i was being saying to myself and others oh i accept all types of people and try not to judge them while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story because of my fear i suppose the second time i watched this film i opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time and really looked not at the type of taboo relationship part that i d heard about all my life but simply at two human beings in love and i loved it i loved the storyline i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film i loved the sharing of feelings and i loved the strong bonds created it is a really eye opening beautifully done film that made me cry at times and i hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually remember that everyone deserves love no matter what shape or form it is presented in 
having read the book prior to watching this adaptation you would think that it would have lost some of its thrill however the story is so clever i could never tire of it sally and elaine really put their hearts into their roles and brought out so much of the characters i fell in love with the story and the women all over again beautiful to watch thanks to direction settings and costumery despite the plot speed of television i don t feel that anything important was lost in transit it had me on the edge of my seat throughout with lots of wonderful stomach trembling moments enjoyed it thoroughly this is the kind of television i have been waiting for 
have wanted to see this for a while i never thought i d be watching it in a damp trafalgar square london with other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boys quickly that experience specifically a new departure from psb it seemed to suffer from the same problem the miniaturist hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der corregidor the long structure was a chain of short ones i e songs psb produced a more fluid integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms neither could they resist song a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was i d go so far to say counterproductive overall it was very exciting though which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achieve it is a very exciting film with choppier editing taking the place of acceleration of tension or action in fact the film though beautifully shot and passionately acted it has a silent film melodrama but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in and there s a huge range of perspective too either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time super film which can be assessed irrespective of sound as that s how the finished product would have been conceived 
i love these awful s summer camp movies the best part about party camp is the fact that it literally has no plot it simply drops a weak batch of characters into a location and then things occasionally happen the cliches here are limitless spoilers the nerds vs the jocks the secret camera in the girls locker room the hikers happening upon a nudist colony the contest at the conclusion the secretly horny camp administrators and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout the only cliche missing is the presence of corey feldman this movie will make you laugh but never intentionally i repeat never a final note be prepared to bust a gut watching the nonsense that is the dramatic scene where jerry riviera and d a share a beer late at night spilling their guts to each other the dialogue literally makes no sense and the acting belongs on a high school stage it s a classic 
i first saw this movie at a video store and being the bam margera fan i am had to rent it to see what it was all about since i have a huge and stupid note the word stupid sense of humor i found this movie absolutely hilarious some of the parts are pointless and random but that s what makes them so amusing you ll need to think things like getting slapped in the face and bashed on the head with a watermelon are funny in order to appreciate this movie i was really impressed i was also surprised at the acting these people actually did a good job nothing oscar worthy but well enough to get past the amateur level teens and young adults would probably find this more entertaining because of the modern slang and situations used i wouldn t suggest watching this with your parents and vice versa all in all the acting was great the script was hilarious and the story is really something you can relate to 
i just watched nightbreed for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost years ago and while i remember liking it at the time i don t remember being blown away by it like i was today i really can t complain about anything in this movie craig scheffer is excellent as the lead character of boone i never understood why he hasn t had a more successful career because most of his early work is outstanding as good as scheffer is cronenberg is even better his portrayal of the psycho dr decker is unforgettable and steals the show the rest of the cast which includes doug bradley is very good save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff the visuals are good and in some shots great the danny elfman composed score is as good as it gets and is among his best work the ending was epic with nonstop action for close to twenty minutes overall nightbreed is a tremendous accomplishment for clive barker and ranks as my favorite of his movies just slightly ahead of hellraiser 
i picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick and i ve always been a fan of foreign films however for someone who likes movies i was surprised at how much i hate hate hated this movie although it does aim to expose the lives of young lowerclass men in lima and to an extent it does succeeed the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them although the story chiefly revolves around m he rarely ever speaks and his dialouge is at best amazingly dry and dull warning some small spoilers basically the story revolves around a young man named m who has been searching for jobs but without success he does gain employment twice but quits because they re not for him when you re poor the last option you have is to be picky some amount of time is spent with his friends who s idea of fun is to rape a little year old steal crappy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime sack of weed and several other slightly retarded activities m s friend comesup with a plan to make a piece and move to the us by running cocaine to miami when the drug lord gives them a job we re treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given to shop get there hair cut and then strutting off looking like slick gangsters one character carlos will from this point on wear sunglasses always even at night the day before they leave the leader of the group leaves to speak with the drug lord leaving m and his friend to be dumb they party up take several samples of the drugs they re suppose to run and break into thier old school acting like animals and smashing everything in sight the movie ends when m tries calling his girlfriend who hangs up on him the friends then proceed to set the pay phone on fire which brings out a bunch of kids and some old man with gun m and carlos friend in charge of the drug run shows up on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now then he takes off by himself and gets shot by that old man the police show up and arrest m and his friends but not the man who shot the guy and cover thier dead friend up with newspapers as music plays and it fades to credits end spoiler i even watched this movie a second time hoping to see some subtle redeeming factor for it but i did not a complete waste of minutes although i must give it credit for being straightforward and not shying away from disturbing elements the casting acting and overall direction still leaves much much much to be desired imho if you re interested in a movie that explores the issues this one was suppose to go rent city of god cidade de deus instead avoid this trash at all costs you have been warned 
 spoilers spoilers it s easy to see why the script for this film won an oscar at least during the first half my head was spinning from all of the snappy lines whizzing by noel coward plays a new york publisher `why don t you publish books that you like `what and corrupt the public who charms and manipulates his many hangers on then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre flying dutchman take off in which coward must find someone who truly mourns him before his soul can rest in peace very enjoyable until it gets bizarre viewed at cinefest in syracuse in march 
to summarize my group of friends and i spent about minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes plot inconsistencies untied loose ends and other ridiculous aspects of this movie i found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from jurassic park the editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling in short this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpoint even the new dinosaurs were few and far between although i really enjoyed the pterodactyls we got several brief shots of the new species and only really were involved in the action as a scientist and former childhood paleontologist the lack of any real scientific content not that it had to be realistic but logically formed i e how they built the dinos in and malcom s chaos ramblings was disappointing as well in short the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money i hope that movie goers don t fall for this trap again although i did apparently 
the twins effect chinese action comedy charlene choi gillian chung this vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the very fact that i was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie first of all the characters are memorable contributing a myriad of classic scenes charlene and gillian are naturally cute charismatic and humorous this movie was my first exposure to them and all i wanted to do was reach through my television screen and give them a really big hug the remaining cast did well in their supporting roles including jackie chan karen mok the duke josie ho edison chen anthony wong and the vampire bad guys one of which looks eerily familiar to will ferrell even the abominably horrible ekin cheng was good in this one good characters are important of course because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences and speaking of action this film has plenty of it more importantly there is an emphasis of quality in the fight choreography one aspect that helped in this regard is the featured weapon of the protagonists a sword with a retractable spear ended rope this weapon in and of itself opened up a variety of moves that would have been otherwise impossible josie ho and gillian chung in particular perform some wicked aerial maneuvers using these devices in addition the swordplay is superb and is highlighted by two great sword fights one taking place during the opening train station sequence and the other occurring in the church finale in fact the blade wielding maneuvers showcased in this film put some other highly overrated fan favorites to great shame and i truly feel sorry for those who would cite the horribly choreographed garbage seen in ashes of time storm riders or a man called hero with the well planned precisely executed sequences seen in the twins effect it s not even close i can t understand why this film gets so much criticism i m sure die hard apologists for the hong kong golden age will hate this because it doesn t fit into their narrow minded view of what hong kong action should be we should learn from the downfall of john woo a one trick pony who never learned how to re invent himself we don t need another clone we need something different the twins effect is one good example this film was so good that it actually set me up for being disappointed at other chinese movies with the same actors and actresses this especially applies to ekin cheng whose other films almost always suck and yes this includes the obscenely overrated and exploitative wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph even the twins have never been able to match the value of this movie when both were lead actresses in a film although they have managed to hit some good films when either one or the other takes the leading role e g beyond our ken good times bed times house of fury or when one or both are in supporting roles e g colour of the truth new police story just one look the twins effect should have been a direct sequel instead of a family fantasy i am still yearning to see charlene and gillian team up and kick some butt in another movie but the fact remains that the twins effect hits on all cylinders optimizing their charisma while avoiding a descent into annoyance as in prot g de la rose noire all in all this film has everything one needs to be entertained and may i remind the reader that it is precisely this entertainment that judges the greatness of a movie more so than artsy dramatic elements or meaningless awards from established academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about in the end the twins effect is a classic not to be missed rating stars p s the hollywood execs decided to slaughter this film when it was released in the u s by renaming it the vampire effect and cutting out minutes of footage which includes parts of the action scenes however the final fight of the u s version does have a better soundtrack than the original version therefore i purchased both versions which allows me to first watch the original until about the mark and then swap discs to watch the final fight on the u s version 
i have read each and every one of baroness orczy s scarlet pimpernel books counting this one i have seen pimpernel movies the one with jane seymour and anthony andrews i preferred greatly to this it goes out of its way for violence and action occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book i don t expect movies to stick directly to plots i gave up being that idealistic long ago but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made don t remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes but a barely decent script sticking with the s version rahne
this game has cartoon graphics not much violence and really short levels then why do people say it is so brilliant because it always holds your attention it captivates you and refuses to let go you will try for hours to try and find that damn flight recorder try to work out how to get into the room without alerting the guards etc the levels are short only when you know what to do until that you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find correspondences where to find helicopters and so on and you ll have fun all the while you are doing it well worth a rent 
i am very open minded i watch all kinds of programs to the end good or bad just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones this show had potential to be good but my god what were the writers casting director and director thinking the cast of actors are terrible with the slightest exception of meryl mimi rogers and darcy joy osmanski being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot the rest of the cast kill the show it is the same story line in every episode sam has plans to do something his boss disrupts these plans by assigning him ridiculous work projects then the foolish ways sam tries to accommodate both in a manner that is primarily stupid and lacks any real intelligent humor this is every episode it gets very tiring season they ditch the eye candy the hot girls in the show get written out yet the brother stays explain that casting cut to me please i can see why they wrote them out they had no substantial role but they didn t add anyone better to replace them the cocky derek tricolli character is given a continuous appearance in season his acting along with everyone else s resembles many poor sitcoms from the s might have been funny then but painful now the show could have been so much better with a few good writers and some people who had any talent to execute them this show lacks everything production quality is the only good aspect of the show it is great in that regard unfortunately the content is painfully sad my god fox was there really nothing better to choose from i m sticking with shows like it s always sunny in philadelphia or rock for now the bar should be set by programs like these that actually assume the audience are intelligent and aren t continually drooling on themselves using all their brain power on continuing to breathe 
tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film the acting directing and script are all third rate with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer director star larry bishop to get laid the only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with qt the plot of the film is pretty flimsy and basically tries to survive on not so obscure references to older b movies and some cameos from guys like david carradine dennis hopper and vinnie jones each one is listless in their performance particularly hopper who is in full on paycheck mode at this point in his career the saving grace if there is one is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining bishop tries so hard to get that trademark tarentino banter and just fails miserably which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others i d only check this one out if you love bad movies or if you re really into biker films 
this movie is still alive and kicking today thanks to the presence of alan ladd this is good in one way because the movie has some interesting things to say but bad in another because everyone who watches it expecting that tough guy ladd is going to hoop through his usual paces is going to be mighty disappointed without fanfare or introduction ladd is suddenly introduced in the third reel true his role is a key one but it s small and likely to get lost in the shuffle there are many key roles in former newspaperman martin mooney s ambivalent screenplay which hits out at all political alliances and quite ruthlessly denigrates reform candidates it s the lovely and extremely talented joan woodbury who ties the various strands of the wide ranging story together unlike the usual hollywood production the plot actually proceeds in a series of jumps much like the films later turned out by the french new wave though easier to follow here especially if you are aware that the film s original title was paper bullets nonetheless some of the film s narrative and character switches are a little disconcerting particularly in the role played by jack larue who has wisely elected to act the part in a strangely non committal way one of jack s best acting jobs ever but no one is likely to notice alas 
i just bought this movie yesterday night and i love it everyone did great acting in it especially ryan dunn and bam margera the whole plot was great and as dunn said in the extras on the dvd they made it seem like he was reliving the whole thing all over again this movie has made my number one spot in my favorite movies i can t stop replaying scenes over and over again just to see it again i ve never done that with any other movie i would definitely recommend this to other people to watch because it is such a great movie and if you like bam margera it s a perfect movie for you the little montages that they show in between every scene are just great i think that those have to be my favorite parts of the movie they are very sad with mostly music from the band him which of course is my favorite band 
no holds barred is a movie that should in no way ever be taken seriously it sucks hardcore as a serious movie look at it more in the way that you should plan from outer space they are one in the same in that they are both so bad they are funny the funny moments in no holds barred are usually the ones that aren t supposed to be when rip played by hulk hogan as only he can play them grabs the limo driver out of the front after his first meeting with brell kurt fuller hilarity ensues and it is one part of the movie that every person should see it might be the funniest scene ever i swear anyway how someone thought this movie would make money i ll never know and that person should probably be beaten into submission i hope they at least got fired this movie earns a out of on my scale and that one is just for the unintentionally funny parts 
a funny thing happened to me while watching mosquito on the one hand the hero is a deaf mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does mutilating mannequins er excuse me corpses through his images on the other hand the english version at least is very badly dubbed so i found myself wishing there had been both more and less dialogue at the same time this film is stupid funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town and lurid where would we be in a s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene not to mention the romantic aspect oh how sweet miss it 
i really don t know if this was supposed to be science fiction or horror it was confusing to say the least what really upset me however was the lack of story development between the characters the sheriff s bruce boxleitner year old daughter clara bryant is stuck with him for the summer and they don t spend seconds on screen together at any one time the hot native american jennifer lee wiggins apparently has the hots for the sheriff but they don t spend any time together either the hot secretary kristen honey ends up dead and she had more acting ability than the other two put together the bad developer vs the native americans is an overused story but i personally like evil developers getting theirs as i live in florida the only reason i stayed with this was the creature it was original i have never seen anything like it and i am a sucker for new creatures 
i m not exactly sure why i ordered fingersmith from netflix probably because i enjoy bbc dramas it was on a list of recommendations i had no idea what i was about to see the plot which i will only describe in general so as not to spoil it for anyone who will see it after reading my review has more twists and turns than a mountain road in the rockies of the sort that customarily appear in caper movies they are very unusual in a period drama not having read the novel and i do not intend to do so i was totally unprepared for the surprise that ends the first segment on the dvd and equally surprised by the subsequent twists and turns nonetheless it is extremely well acted by the two young principals by sally hawkins in particular as sue and by elaine cassidy as maud and in key supporting roles by imelda staunton as the mother figure in a house of thieves and by charles dance as the rich uncle who collects pornographic materials and who rescues young maud from the mad house where her mother lived to be his secretary the lesbian affair between maud and sue is the big news in the movie but really not its centerpiece the centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune that maud is due on her st birthday the turns and twists in the plot add tension though not much credibility to the movie however no viewer is likely to doubt that maud and sue will somehow end up together improbably as the credits roll although one has been raised as a ady and serves a collector of pornography and the other is a pickpocket posing as a lady s maid the author obviously means for them to live together in the end it s a bit difficult to swallow since each has conspired to cheat the other despite these reservations i liked movie well enough it does not quite deserve the praise that others have lavished on it the most fearsome and interesting scenes take place inside the madhouse where one of the two young women has been confined until she is able to escape and return to london to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion sally hawkins sue is a very impressive young actress able to convey her character s cascading and changing emotions with her facial expressions and her eyes no doubt we ll see more of her i certainly hope so 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character yardley is the modern equivalent of dickens scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees until the christmas spirit overtakes him the role is a walk in the park for greenstreet who had been one of the stage s great falstaffs when he was part of the lunts company greenstreet had only entered films five years earlier when at age he was featured in what was to become a film classic the first and best film john huston ever directed the maltese falcon cuddles sakall was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of middle european gemutlicheit the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye pleasing gem 
i had a bad feeling when i saw the cheap title work it only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker the only enjoyment i got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws example the background car sounds audio just disappears during the scene with danny and dog in dog s car production shows a total lack of imagination example slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times sandra bullock plays essentially a bit part completely unnecessary to the plot to say that this movie actually has a plot is doing more justice to the writing than it deserves the antique computer hardware is kind of interesting this film was released in not as the imdb database indicates and then current high tech was an amber screen on a mhz ibm pc with floppy drives maybe the pc was the real star of the movie at least it was interesting we got this on dvd for a couple of bucks in the bargain bin at walmart as the other reviewer notes we paid too much 
president harry s truman once said that the only thing new in the world is the history you don t know seven years before richard rhodes superb pulitzer prize winning the making of the atomic bomb the bbc produced a seven part miniseries oppenheimer that was a character study of the people who designed and built the weapon that ushered in the atomic age permanently joining science and technology to the state and in particular the military not merely making history but changing the world forever the production is impeccable the casting nothing short of miraculous not only the main characters but even secondary characters bear uncanny resemblances to the persons portrayed in particular are sam waterston in the title role of american physicist j robert oppenheimer scientific director of the manhattan project who was based at the los alamos nm laboratory the site for which he personally chose manning redwood as general leslie r groves who oversaw the entire manhattan engineering district the project s formal name david suchet as physicist and ultimate nemesis of oppenheimer edward teller who nearly forty years later whispered into ronald reagan s ear and brought us the strategic defense initiative star wars and jana sheldon as kitty oppenheimer the attention to detail is uniformly excellent throughout part thriller part love story and ultimately a tragedy this series faithfully recreates a chapter in world history and that of science that we dare not forget highest recommendation note viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy jacob bronowski s part series the ascent of man and the bbc film of michael frayn s play copenhagen 
even worse then the incredibly boring the exorcism of emily rose it started off decently and right up until the mom said to the dad see i knew she was possessed in an i told you so voice it was a terrible line spoken badly and it foreshadowed the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie every family member has an issue from the past with the priest the dad starts to accuse everyone of either liking his wife or actually having an affair with her culminating with him killing his buddy then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes his friend hadn t slept with his wife after all people are dying others are coming under possession and by this point most viewers don t even care anymore except for their employee miguel none of the characters in this movie was actually likable making it hard to care about any of them the acting was terrible and the writing even worse glad i saw it for free although i feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time i lost 
there are one or two other shemp era shorts i like more i e scrambled brains but i think one can say without much argument that in this particular episode shemp gives his greatest comedic performance as a stooge after rejoining the team in scene for scene this episode hardly lets up from professor shemp howard s voice lessons with the glass shattering dee green to his futile attempts to win a dame s hand in marriage this is your little snookums will you marry me click to the uproarious finish it never fails to keep me in stitches i would be remiss not mention that immortal scene with miss hopkins the always lovely christine mcintyre btw isn t she rather under dressed and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her cousin basil who knows maybe the actual basil was a very distant cousin which makes it legal in some states as far as i know ]
read this boyz n the hood is a scene by scene complete rip off of this movie two friends in the hood one s focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete the friend who s an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed the athlete just happens to be washington from welcome back kotter it makes me mad that people don t know this it blows my mind everytime i go into a video store and boyz n the hood is in the drama section while cooley high is in comedy it s an embarrassing disgrace this movie is both funnier and more dramatic than john singleton s rip off at least singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to cooley high but no he never said a word boys men however named their hit record after this film 
this film is so copy cat clich ridden clumsy and laboured i find it astounding that anyone could not feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it here is the range of idiotic clich s ridiculous psychologising and simply unfeasible storytelling in this hard hitting representation of high school the tough guy jock is really a homosexual the a student is unhappy because his father pushes him and somehow this causes him to commit incest a teacher is mean to a student who wets his pants in class a girl who is going out with the above mentioned jock is really in love with him and just wants a family maybe the only saving grace is the student counsellor scenes which are vaguely interesting but most of the devices in this film are so leaden that it beggars belief this film shows me no insight into teenagers and i will not be surprised when it bombs especially with teenagers the people who like this film seem to be parents worried about their teenagers and boy are they barking up the wrong tree if they think this film will help with understanding teen issues i mean what is the moral of this film hey guys let s all look out for each other and hug each other give me a break anyone who thinks you can get through to a year old with that kind of message needs to think back in the s we were watching kentucky fried movie xtro porky s evil dead terminator etc this film will fall on deaf ears is right up there with another australian indepedent film one perfect day which was as bad as this utter turkey of a film thank god no taxpayers money was spent on this boloney avoid 
apartmente l is one of the most interesting movies that i have ever seen i experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as i was gunning for the two leads to reunite that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end but the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie it is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people as of now i haven t rewatched the movie and i don t think i will the story follows the experiences of a man max who is engaged to be married to muriel he remembers his old girlfriend lisa he considers this the love of his life as he listens by accident to lisa talking on the telephone thus he tries to find lisa here starts his extremely frustrating search for lisa there are many layers to this movie there are undercurrents of jealousy vouyeurism and so on there is also another character called alice who is involved in the whole confusion the movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways it is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique what i love about the fact is that a movie about obsession jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner it has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience the main character max has shades of grey and i felt the ending was perfect i don t think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with alice the character of alice is even worse her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers that is the point i guess the scene where she breaks down in front of lucien really shows another facet of her character it shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life in the end she understands that she needs to get away from it all the ending lends a cynical touch because it seems as if max s love for alice is temporary and fake it is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option i e muriel than to pursue something that is so fleeting i e lisa or alice in many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance in a way the performances deserve high praise vincent cassel as max gives a great performance he perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement his geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly but the real star of the movie is romane bohringer as alice her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of alice and is in love with max the scene where she screams i am a nutcase too really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her btw i also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie alice s actions can be explained in many ways and her unreasonable obsession with lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire it may be far fetched considering she encourages lisa to forgive her current boyfriend but i got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time she also avoids questions from lisa regarding a boyfriend she spends a whole lot of time with lisa and she is happy during that time that may lead many to question her sexual orientation overall i would give it a i think it deserves it but i subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor i think it is a perfect movie otherwise 
no bullets no secret agents a story that is entertaining funny and believable met some of the producers actors in this film at the theater they seemed as interesting in person as their characters on screen you may not hear about this movie on tv with high dollar ad spots but it is definitely worth checking out i have spent for a movie ticket on a lot of other movies that weren t this entertaining looking forward to future projects by this production company 
i loved this movie not because of the romantic story lines between women but for the visualization of human strength despair and liberation this film is a must see entertaining emotional captivating all the characters are very well written and portrayed by some very talented actors this story is a story of self discovery and sexual awakening a journey of the mind body and soul you find yourself identifying with the characters and at some points even the storyline i do have to say that i recommend watching the movie first then read the book if you read the book first you will be slightly disappointed the screenplay adaption cut out a lot and some things were changed some for the better and some for the worst

ok number one this film is a s version of a crappy show from the s that no one remembers number two as soon as the movie started i was confused it was like i walked in halfway through the movie there was no plot it was very annoying horrible wardrobe call me crazy but it s just not believable to me that little skinny omar epps can chase down a big grown man without a gun and scare him into talking it s a ridiculous plot i m sorry but to me kids these days can t even put their pants on one leg at a time let alone catch some evil underground killers i walked out of the theater and demanded and got my money back i do not reccomend this movie to anyone over years old 
i enjoyed the first toxic avenger but the sequel just didn t work there are some funny gags in the opening involving members of the home for the blind but past that point i was simply bored the sequel is also filled with much quirky low brow humor only this time it s not funny much of the gags revolve around crusty japanese stereotypes almost every japanese character seems to be chopping fish does everyone in japan chop fish the troma films are known for being more than a little irreverent but if you re gonna use humor involving racial stereotypes at least make it funny i can t laugh if i m handed the same crap i ve seen a million times before one thing i have to give credit for is the gratuitous nudity there s even more gratuitous nudity than in the first but altogether i was very disappointed and the film ends with a tedious chase scene which had me huffing and puffing dying for the movie to fade to black at least there s one hilarious line from the film which had me bawling with laughter after the villain says a line from shakespeare to one of the local citizens the citizen an elderly woman responds by saying f k you that s from david mamet my score out of 
the custer legend a la warner brothers epic there s no casting against type here with the flamboyant flynn as the flamboyant custer in this rousing tribute not only to custer but to the men of the th cavalry the story traces the life of the famed boy general from his turbulent days at west point to his final fight at the little big horn great liberties are taken with facts here and we are presented with a custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates but this one is done on such a grand scale the battle scenes alone provided employment for every extra in hollywood down beat ending and all this is great fun 
eisenstein created the russian montage theory and this film is his finest example it took years before someone could utilize his ideas and make them work the limey nonetheless the baby carriage scene really demonstrates the discombobulated nature of rmt granted like most movies it gets long in some parts the beauty of the film is amazing one of the best silent films i have ever seen 
i just watched this short at the planetout movies starcrossed was a very sweet sad little movie about two brothers that are in love there is some great subtle acting from both the male leads often times movies with this subject matter seem to get too caught up in the controversy and shock value of the plot that they forget that there is an actual story luckily writer director james burkhammer does not do this and instead lets the story play out with honesty the sequences of the two boys first falling in love are very sweet 
shadows breathes the smell of new york s streets like no film before it this kick off of cassavetes directorial work is as atmospheric as political and the initial spark for a renewal in american cinema maybe it solicits for watching cassavetes first work in a double feature with another debut godard s bout de souffl both films shaped the cinematic production of their countries beyond decades and both breathe a peculiar lightness and jauntiness which was later rarely achieved by those filmmakers in their career shadows tells from three afro american siblings ben ben carruthers lelia lelia goldoni and hugh hugh hurd the story is set in the new york jazz milieu and the driving rhythms on the soundtrack play a main part for the feverish sometimes almost dreamlike atmosphere which draws through the entire film there s not much happening in the plot the everyday life of the three siblings is defined by problems in love relationship or in their jobs but on both levels normality deceives without moralizing gestus cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion in public and in private life it was regarding to the cinematic depiction of racism a breakthrough film in the us this film owes also a lot to the performances of the three leading actors which were all almost completely unknown before especially ben carruthers established with his energetic portrayal the image of a new self conception of young urban blacks in america an image which characterizes spike lee s films of the s and s revealingly none of those three doubtlessly extremely talented actors was able to start a big career afterwards hollywood wasn t and isn t ready to ethnically expand its star system and that is why goldoni hurd and carruthers only found small artistic niches in tv and independent films later on perhaps shadows is one of the less beautiful films ever shot and one of the most beautiful ones at the same time a film of shades and spaces with a camera that merely watches the stream of life in the crowded street corners bars hotel lobbies apartments inducing an intriguing ramble through new york s vibrant streets 
inspired by true events radio is one of the best acted heart felt dramas i seen widely released in sometime it definitely is one of the year s best films of radio stars ed harris who is oscar worthy nonetheless in this film as football coach harold jones coach jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game however coach jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by debra winger and sarah drew one day radio played by cuba gooding jr in his best performance since men of honor comes by the football field while the coach s team is practicing for the game some members of the team then tie up radio and throw him into a building they then bang on the building and finally coach jones suspects something is wrong he comes over and helps radio who is frightened and from that point on coach jones and radio shares a very special bond radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events he also becomes coach jones s main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and radio the movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life accepting people for who they are even if they are different death and family relationships the movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director michael tollin should be very proud of this film the thing i liked most about radio was how real it felt the performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes radio had a great mix of comedy and drama some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad in conclusion i feel that radio was very overlooked by critics only getting average reviews they must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get star reviews and something like school of rock can get or stars it doesn t make any sense to me also the performances as i mentioned before are top notch and oscar worthy in my opinion both ed harris who i think is underrated as an actor and cuba gooding jr should both get some kind on nomination for this movie radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big hollywood movies my final rating for radio is a 
yes it s a fast times wannabe but it s still decent entertainment some of the comedy parts are really funny the scene when the three guys visit the spanish lady is hilarious with a little flamenco music in the background the reaction when her sailor husband comes home is a riot the guys exploits in dealing with crabs are funny as well when they try to drown them and when they visit the pharmacist the abortion scene is a fast times ripoff too but it does do a good job of capturing the terror of the situation you really feel for what karen is going through and for gary in his mad scramble for cash to pay for the abortion and accommodating her recovery the ending is painful to watch but refreshingly realistic first time viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock there is a decent eye candy for guys with young girls and the milf spanish lady but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penis measuring competition underrated soundtrack too check out early early u the cars in their prime and an appropriate tearjerker song by james ingram for the surprise ending some people will hate it and it is somewhat dated but those who like teen flicks or grew up in the early s should like it 
the photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period eisenstein builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the sailor s revolt and the massacre at the town as much as the movie is a high point in the cinema it is also an example of szocialist realism by the soviet government actively used the arts including film as a means to spread the message of the revolution eisensteins portrayal of the revolt on the battleship potempkin offers the viewer insight into the message of the soviet elite marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda 
this is a wonderful old fashioned christmas favorite which i try to catch on tv every year if i can it revolves around a martha stewart like journalist named elizabeth lane charmingly portrayed by barbara stanwyck however in contrast to martha this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever the other cast members effectively complete the story and include dennis morgan jefferson jones reginald gardiner john sloan and sydney greenstreet alexander yardley elizabeth lane is a journalist who writes food articles portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children in reality she is a single woman living in a new york city apartment and cannot boil an egg her recipes are borrowed from her hungarian chef friend felix elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine alexander yardley decides he wants a nice old fashioned country christmas and invites himself to visit her bringing with him a returning war hero jefferson jones a sailor who had been shipwrecked yardley demands total honesty of his employees to get out of her predicament and save her deception based career elizabeth borrows the connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor john sloan a dull fussy chap who has long sought marriage she also borrows a neighbour s baby actually several to pass off as her own and her husband sloan s of course this scenario makes for much merriment it s a screwball comedy and a charming romance with the added attraction of a christmas atmosphere whenever i think of this movie i picture the snowflakes falling the tree beautifully decorated the fire roaring in the hearth the turkey roasting and christmas cookies baking why did hollywood feel compelled to do a remake i understand there is a version directed by arnold schwarzenegger and starring dyan cannon kris kristofferson and tony curtis i have not seen this modern adaptation nor do i wish to this old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday must see along with it s a wonderful life white christmas miracle on th street and of course all the versions of a christmas carol 
this splicing of the searchers is one of the weirdest films i ve ever seen filmed by a briton in a strange unfamiliar mexico it s often said that the best films about america are made by foreigners who can approach the familiar with an outsider s eye but this crackpot film is something else though set ostensibly in post civil war america this isn t an america recognisable from myth cinema tv etc the film has an air of timeless fable about it while dealing specifically with western mythology director harvey uses the title horse as a focus for interconnecting stories all dealing with the traditional western clash of the primitive and civilisation the former seems to have the upper hand the vast scrub and desert of the film s landscape is unbroken ripe for allegories of the mind the only brief sites of civilisation are a stagecoach of missionaries and landowners and their hacienda from both of which derive behaviour that is anything but civilised the basic story intercuts three stories in one an aimless deserter pike having lost his trading partner steals a miraculous horse eagle s wing so called because of its grace and speed in the second an indian white bull owner of this horse waylays a stagecoach and kidnaps one of its female occupants in the third the spanish men sent to find her ignore this quest in favour of a murderous plundering spree although a revisionist western the treatment of the indian is problematic unlike pike his character is never explained forever inscrutable denied a voice except for an excruciating snatch of song when he s not a strange other he s a symbol whose role isn t entirely worked out at one point a savage brute at another he epitomises nature and freedom but pike notes at the beginning that the film will attend to the period of primitivism before civilisation in many ways the film resembles a space odyssey especially its opening sequence part of the film s power lies in the connections made between the three disparate characters forcing us to view the mythic struggles and quests in a different light indian culture and catholicism is linked by superstition ritual greed and murder both pike and white bull are musical and alcoholic white bull is demonised by both pike and the abductee as a bastard unwittingly revealing the tactic of illegitimacy used by colonising whites who infantilised the natives becoming themselves necessary fathers unlike a traditional western concerned with making history civilisation and progress this film is a double detective story interrogating the past tracks remains what gives this film its remarkable uniqueness i think is despite maltin s racism its britishness the climactic stand off is more like an arthurian joust the film itself bravely eschews dialogue for the most part creating the kind of visual and aural tapestry malick missed in the thin red line and something few hollywood directors would have dared the existential doubling and quest motifs are more european myth than american resembling another british harvey keitel movie the duellists most astonishing is the use of nature most westerns use landscape as an awe inspiring backdrop there is little sense of actually living in the west in many ways eagle s wing is like a powell and pressberger film with nature a powerful pantheistic character in its own right alive dangerous hostile beautiful there is a sublime scene reminiscent of a canterbury tale when jewellery left as a trap by white bull in the trees is suddenly blown in the wind there is a haunting tingling magical thrilling effect more reminiscent of the arabian nights than a horse opera heartstopping 
some people may call cooley high the same sort of thing as american graffiti but i wouldn t for starters in ag everyone was white whereas in ch they re all black moreover this one has a motown soundtrack specifically the movie focuses on several working class african american students in chicago and their antics the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships in their apartments we see that there s never any dad around but these young men always know how to live life to the fullest one thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible worrying about missing school two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene and the one white guy in the movie but overall the main star is the soundtrack it is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history we even have it on vinyl here at home a classic in the real sense of the word 
this movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror but not for obvious reasons the horror of a tale of two sisters lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of cgi guts and gore it is a psychological horror movie which piques the viewer s curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout best of all the ending does not provide a clear answer pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins and don t expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately this is not the conventional hack and slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular a tale of two sisters slowly builds an atmosphere of terror a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end even when the final conclusion is revealed it is not so heavy handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene some things will still be open to interpretation and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this the true fear of a tale of two sisters lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares it is a psychological gut wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so called asian horror genre indeed it would be a mistake to align a tale of two sisters with films like ringu and the grudge this movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints some requiring no suspension of credulity others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly whichever way you choose to interpret this film it is one that demands an open minded approach rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general 
one wonders how flynn could have failed so badly as a cinema release in with guy pearce aptly in the lead role it is not often that the casting of someone so famous is so exactly right flynn was a stumbler at the box office and did not end up on cinema screens in australia even after la confidential from a dazzling nude scene in the first few minutes presumably by guy pearce flynn gets off to a fairly robust and interesting start sadly flynn runs out of steam after about the first minutes and with the entrance of hammy steven berkoff in a detour to new guinea looking and acting like he wanted the klaus kinski role in fitzcarraldo the film starts to resemble a tele movie rather than a major cinema biography believe it or not by about the minute make it is boring and you are glad to see it over but such promise pearce is flynn but the movie caused a mutiny at the box office and unlike the bounty sank without trace 
i think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet paper no respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie for example the names of some serbian terrorists that i remember are caradan maldic ivanic loyvek and leo hasse what kind of names are that certainly not serbian by the way caradan maldic what a name i laughed for days thinking about it probably an implication on karadzic and mladic secondly there have never been any cases of terrorism done by serbians a journalist like the main character ought to have known that thirdly the actors playing serbian terrorists are not even serbs nor do they speak serbo croatian all this aside this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper thin and full of holes at times it makes no sense whatsoever 
lead actor yuko tanaka fulfills so much in the exceptionally meditative the milkwoman a tranquil canvass on missed chances in the life of a something woman charting her routine with sincerely poignant motives played out in the picturesque tranquil town of nagasaki akira ogata s unconventional romantic film so to speak is less a straight out melodrama than a deliberate introspection of its characters surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for perfectly embodying the requisite world weariness subjected to a spiritless routine tanaka plays minako oba a middle aged woman who before her work shift at a supermarket takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly nagasaki one of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of kaita takanashi ittoku kishibe a local government employee caring for her terminally ill wife akiko nishina minako and kaita were high school sweethearts who courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents separated ways since then opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young minako vowing never to leave nagasaki ogata does as such with the narrative patiently sticking with minako as he deftly aided by tanako s understated yet highly effective performance follows her whether she s having chitchat with her aunt misako watanabe on being single or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk as she and kaita gradually overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast paced narratives but for the rest it s a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically 
 in search of the cheesiest so bad it s good movie i ve repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films only to be left disappointed and bored at the end not this time my eyes teared up my belly and my cheeks ached from laughing so hard throughout the movie sure hulk hogan is a subpar actor and the plot is utterly predictable but everyone dives into this movie knowing all this all anyone wants to see when renting this is hogan breaking out a can of whoopass with a bunch of yeah brother s and whatchugonnado s flying from his infamously goateed mouth and while the hulkster on the screen pales a bit in comparison to the hulkster in the ring seekers of the ultimate cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this backhand gem of a flick a laugh riot 
formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer vargas it looks very much like a tv movie not really exciting the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it no real surprises here though it is nice to see vargas great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell s part is very small and doesn t add much to the movie michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts the chase scenes are standard fare 
sonny chiba as everyone knows is the man in this film he portrays mas oyama a real martial artist who fought over bulls with his bare hands and won interesting guy look him up anyway chiba only kills one bull in the film but it s a memorable scene and as the liner notes say right up there with the zombie vs shark scene in zombi the film also offers up loads of hand to hand combat and a decent plot to boot though i don t believe all of it is true this film is the first of the oyama trilogy chiba made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action finally three neat little tidbits part of the opening theme was used in kill bill volume oyama himself appears in the opening sequences and that is because he trained chiba in real life for five years 
eric bogosian s ability to roll from character to character in this one man show exhibits his true range as a character actor each persona has their own message to convey about truth society class drugs etc this is an absolute must have for anyone who is a serious fan of acting his performance contains some of the most hilarious and real moments i have ever experienced as a viewing audience 
simply one of the greatest films ever made worthy of sitting alongside such european masterworks as the rules of the game grand illusion nostalghia andrei roublev wings of desire viridiana the night of the shooting stars la strada ordet the passion of joan of arc the four hundred blows and madame de both a blessing and an almost perfect work of art 
this movie came aside as a shock in the eighties far from trends that is to say in the heart of sincere creativity babettes gaestebud stands as one of the finest movies of its time stephane audran the wonderful actress of her ex husband claude chabrol s greatest achievements le boucher la rupture les noces rouges all unqualified musts for movie buffs gave a lifetime performance to see her prepare with love and affection her meal is a feast for the eyes all the people who saw this masterpiece actually tasted ate babette s culinary triumph but the most moving part of the story is its conclusion babette was a great french chef she was famous now she found a new homeland but her heyday is behind her and she won t never be allowed to come back to her dear france so the two old sisters do comfort her in heaven there will be huge kitchens where she cooks for eternity while sharing her fortune with her new friends babette changed their life she gave them pleasure and a magic evening they would remember forever in this simple but extraordinary screenplay human warmth is everywhere and i wish everybody a babette s feast would it be only for one starry night 
homecoming what a huge disappointment after reading the plot summary the dead coming back to vote against george w bush i couldn t wait to see this it started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention unfortunately though it slowly descended into a boring political satire that i didn t need to see i can just watch some good old aussie comedy for that there was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they weren t even that scary i couldn t believe this came from joe dante who could easily have pulled it off with an equal balance of thrills and satire the worst episode so far 
a slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where max is choosing a ring in a jeweller s shop much of what follows reminds us of shakespeare s a mid summer night s dream in which demetrius and lysander fall in love with each other s girl friends here max and lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with lisa and alice and alice complicates things when she calls herself lisa on top of the merry mix up max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago and because max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film i wasn t quite sure if i was in the present or the past there is much running down corridors stairways through doorways into elevators etc i accept all that in a fast paced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other after four collisions it ceases to have any impact if you ll excuse the pun high marks for art design the apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor but i do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in paris saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when max almost exits at the same time however a kiss or two soon makes him feel better if you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks you ll finally find yourself at the airport where max s devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss it can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love like puck in a mid summer night s dream 
many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying men standing in close groups and speaking in hushed up tone a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today soon u will know someone in the house has died the dead person s wife is worried about preparing food for so many people her friend sitting beside her gives an idea of making the matters easy by preparing simple roti sabji one of the dead person s son is speaking with someone over the mobile daughter is busy with her makeup her mother suggests her to wear salwar kameej but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will be visiting their house and hence prefers jeans and t shirt over salwar kameez another son asks her mom to finish all the kriyas and also indicates to her that he should not be expected to come early from the office then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person the white cloth covering the face is displaced slightly due to the wind revealing the face its anupam kher suddenly alarm rings and he gets up from the bed is it his dream or a flash back u won t get an answer until the end of the movie well this is wat comedy is for the director dibakar banerjee later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream is this a film comedy well it is supposed to belong to that category but it actually does not there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie more over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from police so everyone must cheat the cheats or forget about justice music by bapi tutul dhruv dhalla is ok nothing much to tell about other sectors bad script destroys everything not even anupam kher s performance succeeds in making it at least a paisa vasool 
never posted anything here before but after watching noroi i just felt that i had to write down my thoughts about it firstly do not compare this to blair witch this movie deserves far better than that simply put noroi is probably one of the best horror movies i have ever seen and i have seen a lot i really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick but as a documentary filmed by a reporter i think named kobayashi and his cameraman without spoiling to much about the plot i can say it that it starts with kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister while the story might not be that original in itself what really hooked me with noroi was the incredibly eerie atmosphere if you re looking for cheap scares and seat jumping scenes this movie might not be for you this movie is all about the mood it presents with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense the documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable this is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb although not perfect for the general part of the movie far better than in most other movies in this type of genre well enough ranting from me i highly recommend noroi to everyone it is suspenseful creepy well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages 
i think that it s great how chiller picked up this series and showing it for this generation film making has come such a long way especially with the special effects and for one to be able to watch archived shows that they never knew existed they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now monsters is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining it takes creativity for the types of story lines they came up with and each generation seems to have it s own horror series this particular series was not as horrifying as the friday the th the series nor as adult oriented as the freddy s nightmares it was something that an entire family could watch and still get a laugh and a fright at the same time i am happy the chiller channel shows it in their line up i am just about caught up on the episodes i missed when i was growing up 
a brilliant and sensitive movie with interwoven plot lines as a general warning the movie turns quite dark about half way through as sudden as it is this is a change that i found fitting to the themes of the movie particularly the comparison of the ishkanani to the filthy rich and as is said by finn at the end how each person makes up the tribe and how the whole tribe is reflected in each person anton yelchin finn earl is spectacular in this movie he is probably best known as chekov from star trek or kyle reese in terminator salvation but he s been in a whole plethora of movies you ve probably never heard of alpha dog which is another brilliant performance on yelchin s part house of d hearts in atlantis to name a few the point is that this kid really takes this movie and makes it his own other excellent performances from diane lane and donald sutherland are what takes this movie up a notch from great to excellent 
 cooley high is one of my favorite movies ever i think i saw this movie years ago on late night tv with my mother when i was little and i thought it was so funny this movie was also referred to as a black american graffiti glynn turman is wonderful as preach and lawrence hilton jacobs is great as preach s friend cochise there are some other great characters in it as well and this movie has a lot of humor packed into it from the beginning of the movie where cochise goes to preach s home to get ready for school to the sad ending of cochise s funeral this movie is one that will get you laughing all the way there are a lot of scenes in this film that i like a lot the scene where pooter another one of preach and cochise s friends go to the zoo with them and gets the gorilla s feces thrown on his shirt very gross but funny as well the first scene in the street corner cafeteria the quarter party at this girl s house which became a disaster due to a fight and some others are wonderful to watch this movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album which is packed with a lot of wonderful motown hits and artists from the early s only songs on the soundtrack were done in while the rest were from the s the movie is mainly about two friends who dream about getting away from their impoverished and rough neighborhood after high school but their futures seem almost out of reach due to their innocent joy ride in a stolen car that two other hoods were responsible for and preach s relationship with his girlfriend brenda played by cynthia davis almost gets put in jeopardy go out and rent or buy this movie and be ready for a load of comical entertainment get the soundtrack too it is a lot of fun as well 
hollywood movies since the s have treated gays as lepers in condemning homosexuality the film industry has reflected only what the repressive society of its day espoused as an ideology for example in the otto preminger melodrama advise and consent straight actor don murray was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than confess his alternative lifestyle gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since advise and consent in the movie in out out of heterosexual actor kevin kline is cast as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day while the conservative hollywood of yesteryear stipulated that the congressional queer in advise and consent had to commit suicide the liberal hollywood of today dictates that the gay english teacher should be embraced rather than maced basically in out preaches good citizenship in the garb of a politically correct comedy director frank oz and scenarist scott rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness high school teacher howard brackett kevin kline of the big chill will be happy only after he comes out of the closet just as his once fat but now thin fianc e emily joan cusack will only feel happy when she can ditch her diet ultimately the movie contends that straight society will accept gays when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and candor about themselves the happily outed gay tabloid reporter played by straight actor tom selleck here effectively dramatizes this open minded commentary rudnick s lightweight script embellishes the true life incident that occurred at the oscars when tom hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher in in out cameron drake matt dillon a blond brad pitt style bimbo type actor wins the oscar for impersonating a fruity foot soldier drake honors his mentor howard brackett during his acceptance speech not contend to stop there the candid cameron reveals to a live television audience that howard is gay suspicion paranoia and horror set in as the media descend upon the sleepy town of green leaf indiana when would a no name high school english teacher s sexual deviance spark such massive media concern among those reporters lurks peter malloy tom selleck of high road to china and he wants to do a week long exclusive one on howard howard however wants nothing to do with the witch hunting media especially the pesky peter malloy howard denies drake s gay charges to everybody including his fianc e and his mom malloy lingers because he smells a scoop the revelation has turned green leaf upside down high school principal tom halliwell bob newhart squirms nervously with all the media coverage halliwell warns howard that were his marriage not imminent he d have to give him a pink slip meanwhile peter bets howard that his marriage to emily will fall through at the last moment and he ll be there to record the result on camera howard resorts to audio tapes about macho men he struggles to reform himself but howard s efforts are futile guilt swells up inside him and then there is peter malloy who rags him to come clean about his homosexuality finally at the altar in the sight of god howard bursts of course bride to be emily montgomery is floored by howard s gay confession predictably the school fires howard but he shows up for graduation drake shows up too and rushes to brackett s defense not only has the school stripped howard of his job but they ve also given his teacher of the year award to somebody else drake appeals to the principal and wins howard the unanimous support of the community the biggest defect in rudnick s contrived script is howard himself rudnick has created a character too chaste to be true either by gray or straight standards howard brackett looms as more of a saint than a sinner he helps one student gain admission to college and he coaches the track team how often do you hear of an english teacher doubling as a coach too everybody at his high school adores howard he doesn t have a mean bone in his body further rudnick and oz ask us to believe that nobody else in green leaf is gay where are howard s gay friends are they too scared to come to his defense no in out is not targeted strictly at homosexual audiences oz whose screen credits include cute comedies like dirty rotten scoundrels and house sitter as well as rudnick teeter on a politically correct tightrope in out is not a gay recruiting movie the filmmakers show no interest in what prompted either howard or peter malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle instead oz and rudnick are only interested in shoring up a thin premise is he or isn t he gay they flesh it out to involve the community response to the answer finally when howard admits that he is gay the filmmakers devote the rest of the movies to showing how a conservative norman rockwell like town can accept him despite his difference the most shocking scenes in in out is probably when tabloid reporter malloy does a lip lock on howard straight guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are phony kline and selleck grind their faces together in what appears as more of a head on collision than a closed mouth kiss nothing at all like the controversial british movie priest in out emerges as an engaging but labored piece of social propaganda with its okay to be act message if ellen weren t the tv equivalent in out would probably be heading toward tv as a new sitcom watching in out is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight but how to be a decent person in the last days of the th century what makes in out a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunity cheers and jeers about queers and steers 
ok so this film is well acted it has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years the straight man deciding to be gay and the gay man deciding to be straight i did enjoy it up until the last minutes after that i got really offended as what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles the leads are played by handsome men but don t let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled all the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos 
i never dreamed when i started watching this dvd that i would be totally mesmerized by it within minutes the story was completely absorbing and entertaining the acting was superb the biggest surprise of all was how i would be so completely enchanted by the love these two young women radiated across the screen their initial physical encounter for me was by far the most tender romantic delightful vicariously enthralling love scenes i have ever witnessed on film i literally stopped breathing i could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses with no nudity or graphic sex they conveyed more passion and titillation than any american production could ever hope to evince bravo to the author the screenwriter the director and the cast 
i ll say it again one of the worst films ever made and it was made by the director that made one of my most favorite films excalibur i was floored to see it got a grade of over six this movie sucks it looked terrible it looked like it was shot in days and boorman must ve been sleeping when he directed this arquette didn t do anything just plain terrible rotten unbearable and probably the only blemish in boorman s celebrated career 
i love ghost stories and i will sit through a movie til it s end even if i m not really enjoying it i rarely feel like i wasted my time but this adaptation of the bell witch story was horrible it wasn t scary in the least bit what is with the comic relief moments the dialog was tedious acting inconsistent the movie was way too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open like the birthday party the only good think i can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well done i am curious about other adaptation but until then i will stick to reading about the story 
in a world full of films like you got served that blow your mind with its vast amounts of errors you d never figure that there would be worse films until now ron hall s vampire assassins does more than cheese you off it knows that you are mad at it first there are no assassins in this movie in fact there s only one good guy fighting in the whole movie second the location is basically one location some jackass s house or basement it s up to you third the special effects bluntly stated can kiss my ass fourth the acting beats plan from outer space in the worst acting ever category ron hall can t act to save his life finally and definitely not the smallest problem the editing the person who edited this film better hope that i never find him the cuts and shots are horrendous other issues lighting virtually none the fact that the guy on the cover isn t even in the movie and the fact that this film exists to sum this film up let us just say that i tortured the dvd copy before taking it back to hollywood video don t worry i used the mvp membership so it was free never see this film 
it seems on the surface to be a romantic _planes trains and automobiles_ but at times tried for something more where it failed miserably some may like the nontraditional ending but the attempts at deep insight into the world of marriage flopped around not really going anywhere but if you were interested by the story the movie tried other methods to distract you the unnecessary special effects of which the falling rain was the most obvious served to do nothing but annoy the camera work is erratic at best one note of caution however my movie experience as a whole was less than satisfying sitting in the first row with a group of young uns around 
when i think of a s period film this is not what i think of i don t want a monotonous one song robin trower soundtrack i want a soundtrack punctuated with the top bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the s the generic karaoke style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying the acting if you can call it that was very wooden and seemed just read from script in monotone the film quality and camera work was horrid the dialog murky the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent i can t believe people are giving it the high ratings i ve read here basically a forgettable poor attempt at recreating a beloved era of the past two stars is all i can come up with sorry guys 
now i ve seen it all just when i thought it couldn t get any more pathetic and cheesy than woodchipper massacre just when i thought dialogue and acting couldn t get worse than nail gun massacre just when i thought don t go in the woods would retain its title as lousiest slasher film ever along comes the last slumber party somehow this cheap wretched manure manages to avoid lewdness but it remains terrible i couldn t believe my eyes for once i can t complain about excessive or in this case any nudity in a slasher film but it still managed to make me crimson with embarrassment for renting it never before have i seen such horrible acting dialect direction writing i could go on forever with this list here s a quick run down a mental patient somehow escapes from the loony bin dresses up like a surgeon somehow finds out where his doctor lives and breaks in while the doctor s daughter is having friends over for the night then begins the most stupid killing spree ripped off from other movies such as slumber party massacre and halloween this side of the universe the characters have negative iqs which suggests they are not human then again i guess they are not since they have the tendency to bleed kool aid when they get cut as the slasher likes to show use when he holds up his scapel to the camera in way too many scenes it is only minutes how many times must we look at that scapel like that before it consumes the whole movie which i suppose wouldn t be all that bad of an idea in this case there is one moment where i thought maybe just maybe the director would make it interesting a second killer was added but alas it was not to be and then to insult even further there is a stupid super cop out sub ending and an even stupider final conclusion that probably doesn t make a whole lot of sense but i would hate to give away the dumbest few scenes in movie history to those two or three fools like me dumb enough to rent this sewage i sure hope that by writing this i have saved minutes of someone s life i get on my hands and knees to beg anyone still thinking about renting this please please please don t this is a fan of the slasher genre talking i know what is good for you the only real victims in this rattlebrained asinine nonsense are the poor morons that have sat through the whole toilet tank zanatos s score since there is no negative point scale i have to give it a but a below average at that avoid it at all costs please 
one day someone said lets redo the mod squad we can make it hip cool and all that yo it ll make a mint then they actually made it and as you are watching it you can hear your spleen cringe in agony as it twists and binds into a knot from the pure horror of it all any movie ever made has something on this id rather meet wayne newton and sing karaoke with him in a gay bar in idaho and drink a virgin bloody mary than ever watch this again may god have mercy on my soul
after a good start it turned out to be the worst piece of holier than thou propaganda i ve ever seen this movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the holy bible to resume the ok let s call it a plot basically alien don t abduct people that we already know no in fact its demonic forces abducting people which are in new age stuff or witchcraft or read porno magazine as one protagonist does it s complete with the little emotional piano music when the lead character realize he must blindly follow christ to be saved a quote sums it all imagine a subtle piano music in the background you can t let others even those you love stop you from following the lord and we are supposed to live in an enlightened age still work to do boycott this piece of crap
i was surprised that i liked this movie but it reminded me of a version of the first friday the th there were a number of cheesy elements yet at the same time there were many cool ones the story line was good predictable if you have seen more than one or two horror movies but full of one liners to make it worthwhile there are some memorable scenes worth watching a few issues i had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters for instance in the opening scene the scarecrows which were humans on stakes whose blood was drained to grow the crops looked very real but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks there were more than several gaps in the plot and the acting was mediocre but at least it sounded like how real people talk unlike hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it the culmination of the last scene when the main character says i m not a baker i m a connell and lops the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point 
this is a wonderful film as a film it gets an out of as a filmed piece of accurate history one wishes to be more loving but it is a out of and i think i am actually being very charitable what was he like that man of horse and saber who was the youngest boy general in the union army of the american civil war and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the north american indian tribes opinionated militant bumptious bloody handed ambitious clever too clever indian foe indian friend and national hero his death in was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to washington lincoln jackson and grant lee and sherman jackson it is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career the overly ambitious hot spur that his reputation declined yet to this day george armstrong custer remains the best recalled figure in our history s military annals to lose his last battle i can t really think of a similar one maybe general jonathan mayhew wainwright forced to stay with his men on the bataan death march but wainwright survived the march and the second world war custer has appeared in more films than far better generals due to the western adventures and little big horn pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as raoul walsh and errol flynn handled them in this film but even in the legend was still potent olivia de haviland portrayed libby custer who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived george until so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant and with the shadow of world war ii looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth john ford would have fully understood this and approved it so we get the view that he was a hot spur but he was patriotic although almost pushed out of west point by demerits which was true custer was in the class of and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year you see most of the so called military talent from west point from robert e lee down was southern and joined the confederacy the union needed every northern point man they could find custer s civil war career should be given closer study he was attached to the staff of general in chief george b mcclellan and distinguished himself in the peninsula campaign and other eastern front warfare but he was a cavalryman and he would rise under the watchful eyes of grant and sherman s buddy phil sheridan in the latter parts of the war in particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of cedar creek which ended the threat of the confederacy in the shenandoah valley it also hit custer hard on a personal level his close west point friend stephen ramseur joined the confederacy and rose to a position like custer mortally wounded custer sat with ramseur all through the latter s last night alive following the war things fell apart he wanted to make his brevet major generalship permanent it wasn t as it was a battlefield promotion they only had a lt colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier he tried to play politics making the error of supporting president andrew johnson on a political trip in and finding most northerners hated johnson as an inept idiot he supposedly admired the indians he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the west but he caused a genuine military massacre in of indian women and children that ended with a court martial later during the s he would support indian claims against a ring of politicians that went up to the secretary of war william belknap who bought and sold indian trading posts for profit it ruined belknap and left a black eye on the grant administration it put him into the doghouse with grant and sherman who was belknap s former commander and sheridan barely saved his career then he was sent on the final big horn campaign and immortality arrived that career is worth a real film but would it be too critical should we hold a man of the s to the standards of would we like that done to us in a hundred years certainly it could happen but i m not sure we d like it custer style fit flynn like a glove with his giving the closest to a dance performance in any of his major films his final movie with olivia de haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero s character in support actors like sidney greenstreet stanley ridges arthur kennedy and anthony quinn did very nicely as friends foes or even treacherous sneaks kennedy as an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be 
john knowles modern masterpiece a separate peace are one of many subtle and subtly is the watch word themes of love hate jealously denial and regret the version does attempt to address this style and what the book is a love story with war looming in the background the version does not use subtly at all but overtness in the portrayal of the story what is staring you in the face when you read the novel is a love story and yes maybe it is arguable a gay love story in the novel and film version there are sexual undertones everywhere in the writings and dialog in the showtime film version these tensions were omitted and the actors were in there late twenties playing teenagers which caused for mature acting taking away from any tenderness or hesitation of innocence in youth i did not like this remake for more reasons the hair that broke the camels back was that phineas was given a surname on the letters he received from the draft boards finny is a character that does not have nor needs a last name john knowles did that intentionally though i accept the version the acting was at times a little amateurish so what it attempted to be sincere to the novel by shooting on location at phillips exeter academy that the devon acedemy was based on which also the writer john knowles attended as a student the directors and producers took all teenage exeter students with exception of parker stevenson whom attended the brooks school to play in a paramount film class act by preppies compared to this canadian college shot played with adult actors politically correct platonic version no veto on this sham try again the film version with john heyl and parker stevenson was the real deal for a separate peace on the screen the showtime film made for cable version was not

i remember seeing this a long while ago and i knew most of the concept but no detail so i m glad i watched it again from director frank oz the muppets take manhattan bowfinger basically new star cameron drake matt dillon has just won the academy award for his latest where he plays a gay soldier and he does the usual thank yous he even mentions his past school english teacher howard brackett golden globe nominated kevin kline and he outs him as gay howard is determined to clear his name and get out of the media spotlight as a denying gay man especially as his marriage to emily montgomery oscar and golden globe nominated joan cusack is on the way so it comes to the wedding day and when it comes to howard saying yes or no that is when he outs himself and admits to himself and everyone that he is gay this of course gets him fired as a teacher but everyone stands at the graduation day to out themselves in support and cameron even shows up to clear things up so that everyone especially school head tom halliwell elf s bob newhart knows it s okay to be gay also starring tom selleck as peter malloy debbie reynolds as berniece brackett wilford brimley as frank brackett gregory jbara as walter brackett glenn close whoopi goldberg and jay leno the highlight of the film has to be when kline can t help dancing to diana ross s version of i will survive that must have been what convinced him of his sexuality kline is always good cusack is a surprise oscar nominee and all supporting cast members do their bit too in this very funny comedy very good 
there must have been some interesting conversations on the set of eagle s wing with martin sheen straight off apocalypse now co starred with the actor he replaced on coppola s film harvey keitel a real unloved child of a movie dating back to the last major batch of westerns in it was much reviled at the time for being made by a british studio and director conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic american westerns were directed by european migr s which seems a bit of an over reaction the plot is simplicity itself as martin sheen s inexperienced trapper finds himself fighting with sam waterston s nonosyllabic kiowa warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse the eagle s wing across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time before the legends began aside from caroline langrishe s captive irish governess the supporting cast have little to do stephane audran never even gets to open her mouth and it is a little slow but anthony harvey s film does boast terrific scope photography from billy williams and a good score from marc wilkinson 
hard to believe this was directed by fritz lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries this movie has a cast that includes robert young randolph scott dean jagger and john carradine scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving jagger s life jagger works for western union a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about indian attacks and bandits scott is in charge of the men and young is a telegraph expert who can t shoot a gun but can ride scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but scott can t tell anyone it s a pretty good western and lang should of directed some more westerns 
based on actual events of silent film the battleship potemkin concerns an imperial russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny shocked by conditions on the ship citizens of the port city odessa rally to the mutineers support and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of imperial forces who attack the civilian supporters with savage force potemkin is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences amazingly each of these sequences manage to top the previous one and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen s rally to the massacre on the odessa steps the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history filming largely where the real events actually occurred director eisenstein s vision is extraordinary as he builds not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence some of the most memorable images ever committed to film to describe potemkin as a great film is something of an understatement it is an absolute essential an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form purely visual cinema at its most brilliant often imitated seldom equaled never bested gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
project a ii is a classic jackie chan movie with all the kung fu crazy stunts and slapstick humor you expect not as good as the prequel but still it is a great movie if you just want something fun to watch the story is simple jackie chan versus the evil men so if you want a movie that you don t have to be a braniac to understand i would suggest this one 
this movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch i mean it wasn t great but it was one of the better horror movies of late it seems to have been low almost state benefit budget size but it has it s charms like the lovely ladies in it the atmosphere was good also which is what is missing froma hell of a lot of horror movies these days the acting was your typical s low budget affair that being in case you don t know is that it is dud acting but that is what lucio fulci s movies were full of they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc they more than made up for in the horror gore atmosphere for the movie it s self it is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable i watched it all the way and i love horror movies i ve seen movies where i just turn off within to minutes or sit and fast forward it if it s on video or skip scene s on the dvd this movie didn t make me want to do that i sat and watched it all the way to the end without wanting to skip parts i would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having freddy kreuger as your babysitter not but seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection maybe the music in this movie was top notch stuff ideal horror music so it was i ve seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better thank goodness though this movie didn t have nay of the metal music in it i ve been a die hard metal fan since but in horror movies metal music spoils it the movie looses atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing so i m glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy well done it could have use profane grace epitaph of shattered dreams on it though as it is keyboard music no guitars no nothing except really creepy keyboard tracks like track one forever sleep you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some goose bump inducing keyboard music that follows it ever track on that cd is the same ideal horror music at it s best it would have suited this movie perfectly the only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got chibbed killed or so we are led to believe and hung up as a scarecrow only to get free and try to escape later every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed a big out of for them all except the one i mentioned above i wish that hollywood mainstream side of things would give money to romero and the guy who made this movie as giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a goon muppet called paul anderson of the resident evil mince well done guys it is not bad not bad at all i loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie behind the scene s not many movies do this kind of thing which i thought added a little to the movie as it also showed you some outtakes of sorts and that s always a good thing if you ask me rating for this movie rating for the lovely ladies in the movie rating for the atmosphere in the movie rating for the score for the film 
saw this last night and being a fan of the first demons i had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun spooky spirit of it s predecessor this is unfortunately not the case the set up is similar as the first in which a horde of flesh eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played the first had been a movie theater this one takes place in an apartment building and on tv once the demons are released madness and mass carnage ensues that s pretty much it as far as plot development goes it worked nicely in the first part because of the ghoulish make up fx fast pace and unpredictability the sequel however doesn t cut it the first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we don t really care about one way or another if they were annoying or idiots then there would at least be some kind of gratification when they are inevitably butchered demonized eaten alive but these people are just kind of there waiting to be slaughtered plus the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building and out of it they are constantly cutting back and forth between them which kept pulling me out of the story there are some amusing bits courtesy of the splatter fx and campiness such as a constant flow of dripping blood eating through one floor s construction after another as if it were alien acid the first demon possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party and a creepy demon child clawing his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with child however that sequence parlays into a ridiculous looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the chest of the human child that constantly flies across the room at its intended victim i got a couple of chuckles out of that scene but i don t think that was bava s intention the scene probably would ve worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman but hey other little things like the over zealous acting of most of the characters and the bad dubbing don t help matters in summation i managed to see the unrated version on dvd and can t imagine having to sit all the way through the previously only available r rated version because the make up fx and gore were the only thing i got out of it also notable is an early role of producer argento s future hottie daughter asia in fact she probably gives the best performance of the whole cast and she s barely on screen argento bava fan s might want to check it out just to see it but will probably find themselves looking at their watch like i did gore fans might get a kick out of some of the fx but will be laughing themselves out of their chairs at the most goofy looking evil baby puppet since little selwyn from dead alive you could do worse but it certainly doesn t live up to the original 
abysmal pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre lousy audio thankfully obscures the dumb dialog and it s awfully talky for a movie about people who don t speak english there s no adventure to be found here it s a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and one wild animal attack that happens in flashback three pale face dopes wander the african wilderness and encounter warring man hungry tribes of amazons these wild women have advanced out of the stone age only so far as to invent makeup shoes and underarm hair removal technology despite their desperation for hus bahnd the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weaker ones the only thing of interest as if there were any question is the assortment of young women clad in animal skins cleverly designed like the bathing suits of plenty of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripless s stripper moves no nudity or appreciable violence on the other hand you may be humming the catchy native song for days 
the movie was fantastic if your a fan of bams cky videos jackass or his show viva la bam you cant help but like it i have a few friends who aren t fans that enjoyed it and others who thought it wasn t that great those who didn t like it were mostly female friends they really didn t appreciate some of the crude humor that personally i think made the movie so funny i m pretty sure the entire movie was filmed in bams home town which includes a lot of his regularly visited locations the cast of is made up of all his friends and cky buddies and also includes some big name pro skateboarders too the soundtrack is phenomenal with music by him in my opinion haggard has it all a great plot characters you ll never see anywhere else plenty of humor great music and a cast that was dedicated to the project 
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it s so full of details and every time you see it you ll find new things like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice and when the girls flute they can t do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls and there aren t i have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their uncle visit them but why does his wife freak out else a fantastic movie the best asian movie ever i hope people will enjoy it there have been so many movie where the main character is skit so the machinist secret window and so on but this movie is way better than them 
this is the best work i have ever seen on television the story is compelling all the more so because it is true the writers did their homework the accuracy of events is well documented the acting is great this has to be the best role sam waterston has ever had and the black and white cinematography was exceptional my only regret is that it is not available to buy a few years ago i contacted someone involved with the production either with pbs or in england and was told they had no plans to release it on vhs at the time this was a bbc production and ran in the u s on american playhouse there is such an interest in seeing this just hard to believe no one can make it available 
if you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made this movie would be on a short list along with s streetcar named desire i imagine i ll discover some others that qualify but kramer vs kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism so its a very satisfying experience on that level just watching the marvelous probing performances of dustin hoffman meryl streep and the child justin henry in particular one of the best child performances ever but i also find it very satisfying to watch because its such a thoroughly involving story it always makes me forget my own problems it has such excellent narrative drive once you stick kramer vs kramer on and alice kramer leaves ted to juggle work and their young son telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them and even once you know how things do turn out each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again make no mistake kramer vs kramer is not light entertainment its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved for one of the best scripts born out of conversations between benton and hoffman who was going through a divorce at the time ever written executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly not to mention what a great involving story it is put simply a perfect film 
the characterization in this movie is among the worst i ve ever encountered the dialogue is trite and clich to the point of extreme distraction none of the issues the characters face are developed at all they re merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point also the depiction of the chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired i find it hard to believe that the chinese father learns flawless english from a book or so it is implied in one scene so he can teach it to his daughter etc the smile train is a great organization and it s a nice idea to make a heartstring tugging film about the impact a program like this can have on kids lives but overall i found this movie to be more frustrating than anything 
in addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club the people who think that there is anything real about this legend need to grow up this is the st century guess what ghosts don t exist most people learn that from their mother when they re about years old you guys seriously need to grow up the fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud the fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from tennessee believe it doesn t do it either go to college or at least finish high school 
 haggard the movie is well written well directed and well acted there are many laugh out loud moments and some terrific skateboarding scenes featuring margera the scenes of west chester pa are filmed beautifully and the script is just downright funny what i like about the movie is that instead of being another sappy love story or another version of jackass it takes a darkly funny look at break ups from a different perspective most break up films feature a naive woman jilted by a cheating man she then goes on to find mr right and gets to tell her cheating ex to get lost this movie takes a look at the emotional roller coaster of a jilted man without taking itself too seriously ryan dunn does an excellent job as the jilted man and with bam margera and brandon dicamillo as your best friends trying to help you through this rough time how can you take anything too seriously it is obvious that margera and co are incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera i look forward to their future films and endeavors 
alright let me break it down for ya haggard is probably one of the funniest pointless movies you ll ever see it s got a mixture of a unique storyline about a guy having girl troubles and everything going backwards for him mixed in with countless humorous scenes that will keep you laughing throughout the whole movie basically if you ve seen jackass or the cky series you d know what to expect for humor considering it has most of the people from those movies overall i just had to give it a because its one of my favorite movies of all time f rs k n p s haggard rules 
set in bam margera s hometown of westchester pa haggard is a semi true story about the life of ryan dunn and his buddies falcone and vallo dunn has been dumped by his girlfriend of years glauren who is now seeing a beer swilling long haired metal head named hellboy and this is driving dunn insane with jealousy in a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what is going on between glauren and hellboy dunn pays his friends vallo and falcone to break into her house and produce evidence of the affair with somewhat disastrous results for all concerned i found this movie very funny maybe partly because i am a total jackass and cky fan and it has to be said that a lot of the humour will probably be lost on those that do not have prior knowledge of margera insane brand of comedy the movie contains much that will be of interest to skaters not least the cameo appearance of skateboarding legend tony hawk as a police officer there are also cameo s from bucky lasek brandon novak jason ellis and bam s long suffering parents april and phil the dvd extra s include music video s from cky featuring bam s brother jess on drums and bam s favourite band him bam s character in the movie takes his name from him frontman ville vallo there is also a documentary and a too hot for jackass skit in summary as i said before this movie will mainly be of interest to skaters and jackass cky fans but i do feel that margera and co have made a great effort with haggard and i for one thoroughly enjoyed it 
this movie is extremely funny and enjoyable with suitable funny and experienced casts i find this movie enjoyable not only by the elements of humor but also the music in various scenes kevin kline a good comedian has done a good job at being funny in many parts of the film along with tom selleck who is amazingly different from many of his other films the humor within this film are goofy which makes various exaggerations within many scenes especially the beginning bits joan cusack is also remarkably funny and exaggerated and the same goes for all the other casts this film has many elements of goofy humor and is enjoyable if you want to laugh 
i thought this was a really cute movie inspiring makes me want to try acting i love kelly ripa and it s nice that i can watch this in addition to all my children i ve already watched it times of course i also loved seeing joe barbara especially since another world went off the air 
even though the story is light the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so tranquil and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie the film consists of four interconnected stories all about different aspect of attraction between man and or woman and how it frequently is ethereal their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto it will flow out like a handful of sand i thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was the more the man desires her it parallels her deep love for god who is infinitely out of reach but never closer to her heart a very good movie 
 possable spoiler but probably not the game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in it anymore diddy is gone aswell the st donkey kong country was one of my two all time favorite super nintendo games the other being super mario world the nd donkey kong at least had diddy kong and good levels although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times however this one is the worst of the lot it does not have the feel of the original or nd the enemy s look stupid and the levels are even worse it does not look realistic anymore i did not enjoy his game unlike the last two the first had great background music and the nd was not bad but the music in this game is horrible it happens a lot these days that movies shows and sometimes video games that start out fantastic end up with it being ruined by a stupid sequel i am sad to say i feel that donkey kong as a saga is not as good now that it has donkey kong they should have left it at the original or maybe the nd one 
i must admit i was against this movie from the outset but i tried my hardest to be impartial i really did but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated witty entertaining quirky british classic full of character has to be dubious from the outset people in my house were watching this so i swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about films i have studied them at uni after all as expected for an american film of this sort the movie began with a chase which wasn t bad indeed many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark yet the characterisation was abysmal the set pieces could very easily have been spliced from any american schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all character seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery the us version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of donald sutherland s character this allows our us cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic dewy eyed vengeance seeking against the evil doers which it milks to predictable excesses this is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring charlize theron oh pretty oh so pretty look at her pretty wounded bambi eyes everyone which were thoroughly nauseating her entrance scene particularly was like something out of resident evil or tomb raider which were both a more entertaining and b had better beginnings because they couldn t mess up a game like they could with british cinema which was already chock full of spark people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration but i digress the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most ham fisted manoeuvre i ve seen in some time and exposes cynical hollywood blockbuster lust for what it is if you like any of these actors by the way and you agree with any of the above comments do not go to see this film if i had the opportunity of watching fight club or american history x after seeing ed norton in this i would have declined likewise jason statham with lock stock and i suppose the transporter is okay if you like that sort of thing sadly all the set pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking wow he s smart coo he s cool hey what a tough guy then there s the funny pc guy who has comic relief splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance to be honest if you ve seen one or two films like it you might easily confuse the two as clones from the jerry bruckheimer stable not that jerry is irredeemably awful by the way but he just uses the clich s to excess as everyone knows or should this is where i have to come clean i didn t manage to make it to the end so i couldn t even say whether the brilliant ending in the michael caine version made it but i m sorry it s just one of those extremely rare films that if i d seen it at a cinema i would have walked out and staged a small protest outside it s not just that it is another identical by the numbers ocean s or something ocean s eleven was fine but don t bother with the rest with all the glitz glamour fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but i couldn t recognise anything from the original at all so if you are expecting the italian job and not ocean s albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters some disingenuous elements and cardboard cut out script writing then do not watch i don t mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchet job that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic seriously show some pride i felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when i first heard that the film would be made avoid at all costs p s some of the action sequences aren t bad at all so add an extra to the mark if you like this sort of thing 
even if it won t give one more than previous posts here like ruby liang s very good one i wanted to share my own point of view hope my english is understandable bon voyage is a rhythmic light but deep presentation of the french unorganized come down but also courage and charm all along in a brilliantly reconstituted france with many details from bordeaux luxurious hotel occupied by government hq and attacked by useless high class french to parisian coffees near le pantheon rue mouffetard and s cars g rard depardieu and yvan attal give their second roles a brilliant taste isabelle adjani and virgnie ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles and gr gori derang re makes an bewitching performance much lighter than average e g american war times movies and focused on the civilians bon voyage shows a lot of things about french issues even to a french guy like me some of them quite deep 
first things first i am by no means a picky movie watcher i m not one of those people who gets movies just to pick apart the flaws and criticize i like most other people watch to be entertained i ll basically watch any type of movie of no matter how bad anyone says it is sometimes a movie s so terribly made and written that it invokes a sort of pity humor which i get a kick out of with all that aside lil pimp was simply pathetic i saw it on tv and just didn t know what i was watching it was too poorly written and cheesy to be an adult movie and had way too much sex innuendo and swearing to be a kid s movie in fact i doubt even kids would be amused by it the humor pretty generous even calling it that was so pretentious and campy i couldn t see how anyone with half a mind could even find it funny the only thing that made me laugh was how people like bernie mac and ludicrous could put their name and time onto into something so hurting luda s character was such a cheap ploy for laughs which fell extremely short of its goal the plot didn t make any sense whatsoever the storyline has got to be the worst sequence of events ever put together on screen i could keep going on but i want to see what people think of my reaction before i start discussing specific instances of pathetic scenes all i have to say is it really has to make ya wonder how much time these writers spent on their knees trying ta get it made j
this film did a wonderful job of capturing nyc stereotypes at there best if you want a simple cute story however you won t find it here the related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close knit yet contrastingly anonymous lifestyle that is manhattan a perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at new york life in its most natural state 
the beauty the terror the poetry the horror the innocence the guilt maybe that s just about all i should write in this comment for a tale of two sisters the best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it i myself didn t even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when i went into this movie i just took a look at the nice cover art didn t even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into dvd player i only knew that it won several prices on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommended the dvd cover read the most frightening film since the ring the grudge and dark water though the frightening part might be right you can forget about the rest because the only thing a tale of two sisters has in common with those movie is a ghostly apparition with long black hair it s even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous japanese movies because this korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others this movie simply is a small masterpiece and here are some reasons without telling anything about the plot the movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprise twists and just when you think you ve had the conclusion whether you get it or not that s irrelevant for the moment and you think the movie will end this movie goes on a bit longer the cinematography is amazing using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night the camera work is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive if not innovating angles some shots are pure poetry e g the top shot with the two sisters at the lake it all looks very stylish there are only four main characters but the intrigue surrounding them is intense the story itself starts a bit slow but there s a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting there was even one scene when the girls took off towards the lake that suddenly had me remembering peter jackson s heavenly creatures but when the horror kicks in it s quite effective there are also a few successful surprise scares in it damn i jumped right up from my sofa the musical score is great and at times when it s not supposed to be scary i couldn t help but noticing that it had sort of an italian feeling to it a bit strange for a korean movie but nevertheless a great score so much care went into every detail of this film including a perfectly balanced surround sound i also think that calling a tale of two sisters just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit it s more a mysterious horror drama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level no matter how you look at it this is asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest it might not be gory but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed so if you haven t seen it yet then find a copy pop it into your dvd player go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it s minutes running time there i hope i did a good job praising it without spoiling anything 
ok the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem i e the story started out in life as material for buster keaton s silent classic chances comedy or acting in any genre for that much is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before if it s not a totally original creation here we have the stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget short time span of a film they re handling things just fine regardless of what the credits say on their films real stooge philes know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction they took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation words spoken by emil sitka himself during a documentary about the boys here what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married is actually organized chaos every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action how many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery most obviously the seinfeld crew but none others that i ve seen in the last years of watching tv the critics will always pooh pooh the stooges or laurel hardy and others but then again who ever remembers the critic s names or what they said simply watch laugh and enjoy 
this film is terrible honestly the acting is terrible the script made me cringe the effects are completely lousy which i usually don t mind for older films but this was made just two years ago and everything about it just annoys me a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son of course before that it has the clich you really believe that ha ha ha it s just a story routine dragged out for a while the witch s cannibal son was made a retard i don t know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy but this film failed at both it has minimal gore and no nudity which made a bad film even worse heck the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene and even that could of been better honestly don t even waste your time watching it on cable and certainly don t consider buying or renting this else you ll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining 
call it manipulative drivel if you will but i fell for it sure there could have been more character development yeah there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant movie of the week score but ed harris was impeccable cuba gooding adorable and touching and let s face it people in real life how many of us really get to know the motivation of others not many we did get a little glimpse into the coach s motivation a very provocative dialog in my opinion not to be soon forgotten so in my opinion this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his comfort zone to reach out to another human being and in the mean time touched the lives hundreds more a lesson we all need to me reminded of why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do i recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart you won t be disappointed and bring your kleenex 
about the movie itself there are ample comments i just wanted to say something about the german version which i have seen recently on tv it is heavily cut from to minutes it is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for german tv i understand the reasons for that but this movie was something else they did not only cut gore shots they have cut entire sequences sparing only glimpses like we have to attack them one second shot of explosions in the camp protagonist running away when the assault on the island begins it isn t even possible anymore to follow the storyline all the cuts create something that amounts to a string of erratic disconnected scenes that don t make any sense anymore i could not stand to watch the end after spending minutes on this nonsense i think i would have given the original the german version is worth only get it on dvd and check the runtime first or forget about it 
while all of the fleischer famous studios superman cartoons are excellent billion dollar limited the third in the series is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation plot and pacing why it wasn t even nominated for an oscar as best animated short for incredibly enough only the first one was in inexplicable here lois lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the u s mint masked gangsters in their super powered for car take off after the train determined to get that gold without giving too much away what ensues is a thrill ride for both the characters and the audience with truth justice and superman triumphant at the end as they did in all the fleischer famous superman cartoons clayton bud collyer and joan alexander who played clark kent superman and lois lane on radio have the voice work honors here and fleischer perennial jack mercer gets a little to do as one of the bad guys as well 
never mind the serious logic gaps never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals never mind the haphazard writing and you might like this movie the main character alyssa was supposed to be endearing the heroine who you root for to be saved or in this case save herself but instead she merely grates and makes one wonder are all pro ballerinas really that stupid her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor innocent young girl from your grasp with an ever present biting artistic director villain and the cliche s not only does she become anorexic bulemic an over the counter junkie and a pathological liar but all in the course of a few months it s like the writer read every horror story he could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much he could cram into two hours with commercials believe it or not but i am a dancer this uprising or resurgence of anorexia and bulemia that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools i have attended in fact the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight i m not saying eating disorders never occur but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movie another annoying problem this movie had was the means to an end writing style her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time all in the first half the other supporting characters were merely props decorations to further the story given the right dialogue this would have been a very intricate mind study of a psycological problem as it is it turns into a one woman show and kimberly mccullough doesn t have the chutzpah to pull it off to a non dancer this movie would be a supposed insight into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company to a dancer this is a very insulting movie which portrays ballerinas as stupid and parents as pushy and ill informed those adjectives more correctly describe the people who got this on the air in the first place 
 spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequel makers think that they have to explain and therefore destroy the mysteries behind iconic horror films the original hellraiser of was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made the sequel hellbound was also a fantastic horror film though i personally didn t like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites some of the all time creepiest horror villains in the original the third part hell on earth was already quite a mess whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy lead cenobite pinhead a typical s stupidity and therefore destroyed most of his scariness this fourth part hellraiser bloodline is slightly more atmospheric than the third one but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary background information about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hell seriously did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made i think not and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film the setting of bloodline goes back and forth in three different periods the film begins in a nd century space station when scientist dr merchant bruce ramsay attempts to close the gates to hell forever when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons in th century paris merchant s ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an evoked demon the princess of hell took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina vargas since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages the film which takes place in the th century the present and the nd century really is quite a mess i admit that the part set in the th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements the film s undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make up and gore effects the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the she demon and pinhead doug bradley who in spite of having lost some of his creepiness still is a menacing villain it is an almost offensive idea for hellraiser fans however that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light show overall bloodline is not a complete disaster but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee overall this is only recommendable to hardcore pinhead fanatics and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demon s creepiness all others are well advised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second part of the hellraiser franchise and skip all the others the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy as hell but almost everything else is disappointing my rating 
far from combining the best bits of pontypool and days this managed to ignore them whilst shamelessly copying them if that makes sense pontypool was different and got progressively tenser this just stinks the radio dj we must stay on air spends effectively no time on air he sits on his bottom and watches the tv for news this is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever is there a single person in the usa or indeed the world who doesn t know what a zombie is or ever heard of the word zombie well by the th minute this bunch of misfits are still calling the zombies the infected ones or the ones with rabies the word zombie might make a guest appearance later i could care less maybe there s a copyright where you have to pay to use certain words like the bluetooth earphone is called the ear thingy i kid you not to finish no plot no acting no one cares a waste of time a shameless poorly executed rip off 
 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies friday the th and the burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like don t go into the woods alone and this one but in all fairness the prey is nowhere near as bad as don t go into the woods but it s still not great either one thing is that it s just boring and acting isn t very good but much better than dgitw and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at all three of the female leads were stunning one thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time space so what was there to like about this movie well there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments i couldn t contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moon walk to get away from the kille and there were a few good kill scenes my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag and the phoney looking all in all the prey is dumb boring and the killer i didn t find scary at all this movie could have been a whole lot better 
i don t even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie i mean really you got this guy running from a bunch of cats because he s dead but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them and they leave a corpse even though normal people can t see them because their dead the script already has a hole in it the size of nebraska then you have the main character played by susan paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot it s absolutely horrendous and i don t even understand how i managed to see it all the way to the end of the movie the end being just as stupid as the entire movie mind you and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what so ever they might as well have called this movie the little movie that could choo choo ka choo 
i actually found out about favela rising via the imdb website i have a particular interest in afro brazilian culture and films favela rising is one of those gems that gives a new meaning to human transformation beautifully documented and filmed by jeff zimbalist and matt mochary its the story anderson sa a former rio de janeiro drug trafficker who after the deaths of family members and friends becomes a christ like malcolm x and ghandi all rolled into one sa formed afroreggae a grassroots cultural movement that uses afro brazilian hiphop capoeira afro brazilian martial arts drumming and other artforms to transform the hopeless and most times angry youth into vibrant viable caring community loving individuals a few years ago i remember going to a screening of city of god cidade de deus and walked out of the theatre completely numb the images were grim yet stunning and you couldn t take your eyes off the screen i remember how hopeless some situations were in the favelas and how decadent the society was due to the governments neglect how drug trafficking was a way of life how indifferent the citizens of the slums were because death was an every day occurrence like city of god anderson sa talks about how the people of the favelas were also desensitized he talks about the police corruption and how the communities were so immobilized by drugs and gangs that you couldn t visit family members in other favelas you had to meet in a neutral location unlike city of god anderson sa s grassroots movement afroreggae provides solutions to the anger the hopelessness there was one part in the documentary where anderson in the spirit of a preacher approached some youth and asked them to join afroreggae these jaded youth were so scarred by everyday survival and violence their role models were drug dealers and this is what they aspired to be anderson told then that drug dealers don t live very long there was reluctance of course but five months later he was able to get some of the youth to join afroreggae the visuals in favela rising are beyond amazing its clear to me that jeff zimbalist and matt mochary are not only great story tellers but visual artist as well this is a must see documentary there are some really magical and transforming moments in this documentary i don t want to spoil them for you i want you see it for yourself please tell your friends academics youth counselors family members about this wonderful film it will make you care about the world and our children i would give it eleven stars 
sometimes there s a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe this is one of those films of course i can t help that i m biased i m from chicago so i watched the scenes closely for accuracy and i don t find billy crystal funny at all and i can t stand all that english style photography tony scott etc with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent soft lighting i suppose we re supposed to believe that billy crystal is really from chicago because he wears a cubs jersey oh and the plot if you really think about it these guys should be locked up not the bad guys since they re more dangerous and of course there s the clich of the cops on the verge of retiring but the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guys machine gun other to death in the thompson center a state building of course it s a cool building but it s the equivalent of making a huge drug deal at the white house 
be prepared for the trip to haneke s la pianiste the psychological sickness of the main character wonderfully played by huppert goes beyond any limit you could expect the most stunning part of it is that you start feeling compassion for the character erika trash sexuality no nudes scenes though perversion masochism incestuous relations haneke gives us a crude meal heavy to digest sometimes the only way you can escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing at it the mise en sc ne is maybe not the most appealing part of the movie it has obvious austro germanic sometimes scandinavian notes static long scenes but never boring the vienna settings the french language used make the whole look like a european blend the permanent germanic music background schubert is beautifully chosen above all both of the cannes awards for best actors are well deserved one of the greatest performance of the year by one of the greatest french actress ever 
put simply this mini series was terrible let me count the ways absurd plotting over acting scattershot approach to characters annoying narration inability to create viewer interest this film can t even pass the soap opera for dummies test i m sorry i have not read this award winning novel so i am judging it only as a film but it really stinks imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers you look at the wide variety and want to taste them but suddenly they are withdrawn and you wonder where they went that s like this film with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out there are enough stories and characters in this film to create a episode series yet we are given less than four hours to digest it all there are more facial expressions and reaction shots of ed harris than you ll find on monkeys the pace is extraordinarily slow dennis farina and helen hunt are so far over the top that their characters are not believable joanne woodward s character is one dimensional the persistent river metaphor becomes trite and probably the most absurd part of the film the cat this evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers well come on now it s not even good stephen king probably the most interesting character in the film and one who is not drawn well is john voss the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this film just about everyone in this film is unbelievable to sum up there s little here to inspire the drama is poor melodrama it s just a terrible effort 
ok i just flipped channels and caught dw i watched it knowing it would be trash but as a person who has seen tons of films this one stands up there as one of the most purely bad films i have ever seen i m not kidding it is so bad you have to watch it like a bad accident you can t turn away from sometimes these kinds of films work ie troma movies but watching martin balsam and charles bronson slum it up like this is painful what s even funnier is i pulled up imdb to see what other people said and it actually scores a i can t believe it made it past equally as funny is this is not even the pinnacle of this series somehow this garbage warranted part and and to top it all off some dude s comments on here referenced this as the best of the series and his favorite film of all time statements like that scare me about this world 
this tv adaptation of sarah waters novel was so lovingly done i can hardly find the words to appreciate it not since tipping the velvet also highly recommended have i seen such a performance by the lead actresses this time by sally hawkins and elaine cassidy they acted with their souls and this is what gets across to the audience the supporting actors were well chosen too they made a great ensemble for those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship no this is only one part the other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love and the plot has some further surprising twists so the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me as well 
this movie was perhaps one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films i ve seen in a long long while to be fair i was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula but i was anticipating to at least be entertained with such low expectations how could i manage to be disappointed jim carrey possibly my favorite actor not sarcasm did little more than tread water in this film he seems to have temporarily returned to his funny face making roots and created a character no different from his fletcher reede from liar liar this new character dick harper a k a fletcher is a poorly rendered and miserably written whelp if you find yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and essentially boring character it is most likely because carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him carrey s outlandish posing becomes humorously awkward and ultimately sad tea leoni as jane does little more than provide the abbott to carrey s costello i typically find tea leoni refreshing and underused but not in this case jane harper could have been easily played by any actress from age thirty to forty five and it is in that non specificity that the character of jane becomes uninteresting to watch she simply has no defining trait other than her following of the movie s general theme which seems to be that wait no this movie has no theme unless you count big business is evil as a theme i thought that was more of a given richard jenkins and alec baldwin both deliver believable though tired supporting performances but neither man seems truly invested in the role they re playing it s very clear that alec baldwin was putting about as much effort into playing his role as the sinister c e o as he puts into eating a sandwich which he seems to be doing a lot of lately slight tangent but has alec baldwin played any roles in the past few years that hasn t required him to be a powerful jerk in a suit anyway take my advice if you haven t already witnessed the horror for yourself save your money this is the one to catch on hbo in a few months dick and jane are present but there s no fun to be had 
it would be so easy to dismiss an alien abduction movie before even seeing it as i did but this is well worth a look if you think about it its not an easy subject matter to handle but this film manages to suspend disbelief which in itself is a feat for such a way out subject casting the main character as a doctor was a sensible move which lends credence to his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction vosloo plays it very sensitively involving us in his pain and confusion at the weird events that befall himself and his wife special effects are used sparingly but to shocking effect and at times the movie is totally gripping but sadly there are a couple of points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion also after building to a tense climax the ending is something of a let down the supporting characters were unnecessarily weak the alien hunter or menacing the psychiatrist which also served to detract but all in all it raised some interesting issues amongst which was a telling line how do think animals feel when we experiment on them the concept of lost time was also thought provoking 
or that s what the filmmakers would like you to believe anyway this movie tries sooo hard to be cool it s ridiculous everything from the look of the film the cinematography the editing the dialogue and the acting is geared in super cool mode from the get go just to make sure that no one misses how cool this film is there s a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a twangy western surf tex mex guitar playing constantly throughout the film as a final reminder of how frickin cool this movie is all the actors have been instructed to speak in a hoarse voice because as we all know that s badass the plot if there indeed is one seems pretty straightforward but as someone else already pointed out the director and star of the film seems fiercely determined not to tell that story instead focusing on a plethora of naked babes and dialogue that s supposed to be badass but grows tired surprisingly quick did they have an contest to see how many times they could cram the words pussy and f ck and its derivatives in an minute film this movie was absolutely horrible 
ever since i ve been allowed to play goldeneye once again it s been impossible to get my mind off it i m surprised i could have gone without it it is without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time i have never played any other shooting games but i know that this one rules above all most people blame it for too much violence but i find that ridiculous there may be a few graphic antics but there s far worse out there most importantly it s fun with an awesome arsenal of weapons such as the rc p and the classic golden gun you ll go through several challenging levels from the movie completing crucial objectives and fending off swarms of guards there are tons of awesome cheats to get and even two secret levels that you will only earn if you have the true skill goldeneye is also one of the greatest multiplayer games ever as well you can choose several characters from the movie classic villains from old movies baron samedi oddjob may day and jaws and guards in the game chances are you and your partner s will be laughing so hard as you blow each other away that you ll look like bart and lisa simpson watching an episode of the itchy and scratchy show so if you don t have the game don t rent it just buy it it s too good to be true for cool goldeneye stuff check out detstar com s goldeneye website every james bond lover will dig this game big time 
this could have been good but sadly its too inplausible anthony sabato jr has a grudge please i wanted to like it love shark movies someone should have asked my opinion before they wrote this ha ha the shark is cool but the story lacks alot 
the best thing about the prey is the tag line it s not human and it s got an axe the movie itself is a padded stinkaroo endless insect and wildlife shots make the viewer wanna die no slasher fan will like this garbage watch friday the th again and burn any copy of this film you find it also rates as one of the worst films ever made 
john cassavette s decided as his first film obviously as one shot on a shoestring in new york to not even have a script with dialog and delivers a feature equivalent of larry david s curb your enthusiasm all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk in other words it s one of the most realistic looks at the beat generation jazzed sweetly in it s score and telling a tale of racial tensions a group of black siblings are the center point with one trying to get better gigs than the average strip club and has a sister much more light skinned than him who gets entwined with a white man in a relationship which shatters both sides the film however isn t exclusively about that cassavettes likes to have his characters wander around new york city which not many films did in and his style of storytelling is like that of the improvisational jazz artists of the day dated to be sure but worth a glance for film buffs martin scorsese named this as one of his heaviest influences 
now this is a bad movie if i ve ever seen one in one of film s greatest years detroit rock city contends with runaway bride and wild wild west for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies the plot is masterful four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of kiss for the third year in a row so when their tickets are toiled by an ultra religious chain smoking mom the pals scramble themselves in getting to detroit and i m sure you can figure out the rest well not exactly the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members no not gene paul ace and peter go about getting these tickets losing your virginity in a confessional saving a smoked out bimbo and your mom s volvo from the soprano s steve schirripa nonetheless preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a year old s debt and of course stripping down to your bare essentials for mc ron jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon leftovers sounds funny doesn t it perhaps detroit rock city does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go and we do understand this movie is a comedy it is supposed to be filled with slapstick but does detroit rock city aim to the proper audience it is rated r meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents the audience as i see it to which many will eventually hail this one a classic will voyeur is through illegal terms detroit rock city also fails at giving itself the late s touch the camera s texture quality is way too clear and way too bright missing the necessary flair from films like this is spinal tap and sid nancy this would ve allowed audiences to feel `more at home with the times simply costuming kids into pre s grunge wear and settling others into `disco infernos does not do the trick environment does mean something you know i doubt detroit looked this glamorous in if there s anything positive coming from this movie it s the kick ass soundtrack of hard late to early s rock van halen ac dc you name it it s all here of course we can t forget kiss the band aptly subjected throughout what the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the knights of satin s service it s really just kiss were so frowned upon by moms around the nation sure the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that encouragements for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well but what is kiss saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group what separates these anthems of `rock[ing] and roll[ing] all night and partying everyday from the rest of the music most likely these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them simply because it is kiss and they rock and we must do everything in our god forgiven power to see them stars
this film had everything i need in a film women skateboarding violence music by h i m and tony hawk the artwork and camera effects in this film is amazing the music in this film is the best i ve heard in any other film each track goes so well with its scene i thought the acting was really good considering none of bams crew have been in scripted films before although the whole concept of the film is the story of ryan dunn and his girlfriend glauren who is sleeping with hellboy behind his back is a predictable and age old story they way its acted out is very unpredictable for example falcone and the gas tank raab himself dunn breaking bottles behind the wawa and all the don vito scenes this films is a must see 
in watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind one wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition no other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for tyra banks to do so but as the series goes on and on i ve come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill women shouldn t watch this teens should stay clear of it unless they re doing book reports on the subject many women try out for slots to compete for americas next top model they live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim you will see me again heck i m trying to see what happened to the ones that did win actually this is the dream of some girls and good for them in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like hades the other way like to college i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks the full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose so of course that would make them look even fatter a ploy fashionatas use all the time bad bad tyra and crew but to be fair americas next top model is not about full figured models it s about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix hence the name of the show hence the sorry lot of judges photographers associations hence tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get but then again that is the one thing i like about this show the ex model giving others who wouldn t have the chance a chance to enter the doors but after that everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program 
i saw this television version of a christie mystery story when it was shown back on channel in new york city in at the time i was surprised it was not shown on channel the public television station that showed most of the masterpiece theater programs but aside from some dorothy sayers lord peter wimsey stores and the moonstone the bbc productions rarely dealt with british detective stories another series the rivals of sherlock holmes had dealt with stories set in the victorian and edwardian period so a period charm was involved in getting those stories onto channel the plot of why didn t they ask evans dealt with a young couple stumbling upon a dying man who s only last words are the question of the title of the story the novel was originally called why didn t they ask evans but subsequently was retitled the boomerang clue the young couple start investigating the murder and trace the crime to a set of people who surround a questionable doctor eric porter despite the warnings of the father of the hero john gielgud the hero james warwick and the heroine francesca annis pursue their investigation even as it gets murkier and more dangerous the death of another suspect by suicide increases the apparent dangers as the killer starts looking into silencing the two amateur detectives it s not a bad film although i agree it was a bit too long for a single night s entertainment if it had been done like later miss marple episodes with joan hickson or the hercule poirot episodes in two parts it would have been better but it has it s strengths one is the proper use of porter as chief suspect and a clever scene later in the film where he appears to be spying on the young couple who are investigating the mystery if you stick to the film you will be in for a fair surprise later on but it has one failing when dealing with a christie novel the figures in the story have to be in a rigid schedule of movements so that the reader might be able to figure out what the secret of the plot is i will only add that if you hear the dialog at one point and how a little boy was almost killed but wasn t then you will find all the parts of the story coming together and what the villain s motivations were except for that and the lengthy time the telefilm takes to tell it s story it is quite a good film and worthy as one of the best programs based on a christie story in the period when their was a sudden renaissance in films based on her novels 
this is a family movie that was broadcast on my local itv station at am a couple of nights ago this might be a strange decision on the part of the schedulers but the real howard spitz is a rather strange film strange in the way it doesn t want to upset its audience come on there s nothing kids like more than sadism and that s why roald dahl was such a popular author for children it also explains why doctor who was such a successful show across the world in this screenplay you re just dying for pulp fiction author to do something nasty to the kids but this doesn t happen i m not advocating child abuse but to see howard spitz lose his rag at the little ones would have made the movie rather better can you imagine how much worse kindergarten cop would have been if the producers had gone all pc i mean if you re making a movie centered around a children s author who hates children shouldn t the story show and not tell much of the problem lies with director vadim jean and you do get the feeling he doesn t know how to handle the material which is bad news for the movie as someone previously noted the soundtrack is haphazard and kelsey grammar is very wooden i guess he was trying to play it dead pan just like in that show he s famous for but it fails to work here and there s many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles which seem unintentional but which are very distracting but at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the audiences sensibilities
i just watched this film this morning and i found it to be a great showing of the richness of faith babette gave them another way to look at life not a replacement but an enhancement she shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her i see the story of god in here he sent his only son to man man could not possibly give anything that would equal that so for our small sacrifice we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it in this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of god babette showed them that life and god can indeed be beautiful in it s fullest sense the love that god s son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it even the film is a metaphor it seems slow in the beginning but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end it was truly a feast 
while escaping from a heist of a bank the outlaw vance shaw randolph scott helps edward creighton dean jagger the chief engineer of the western union that is surveying the wild west and had had an accident with a horse in vance regenerates and is hired to work for the western union with the team that is installing the poles and cable from omaha to salt lake city vance and the engineer from harvard richard blake robert young flirt with the gorgeous edward s sister sue creighton virginia gilmore and she chooses vance however his past haunts him when the outlaw jack slade barton maclane steals the western union cattle disguised of indians western union is a good but predictable western directed by fritz lang the story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the west facing thieves and indians the entertaining story has action drama romance and funny situations but with the exception of the identity of jack slade there is no surprise in the story randolph scott gives another magnificent performance with a great cast my vote is seven title brazil os conquistadores the conquerors 
i think andrew davies did an admirable job of taking a magnificent book which emulated the pace and styling of a victorian novel and turning it into a moving and entertaining film i m glad i read twice the book first which is usually the case for me i know that one must view a novel and a film as different media and judge them accordingly but still it s often hard to read the original material after a film gives away the best parts i realize that davies is a very good adapter but i wish the producers had chosen a woman to write the screenplay davies as he admits in the commentary that accompanies the film on dvd wanted particularly to emphasis the more scatological bits in the book i certainly enjoyed those on film as in the book but davies missed a half dozen moments that are so excruciatingly painfully tender which he could have incorporated if his sensibility were more feminine i also would take issue with his use of the book s primary symbol the rose as the screenplay was plotted by davies the denouement was inevitable and appropriate but i really think that author waters final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting and i preferred way the novel let nan come of age than the way davies chose one quick comment about the four actors who essay the primary roles they are all wonderfully talented well except for the singing and dancing perhaps and moreover their physical presences are so much what the mind s eye sees when reading the novel before seeing the film i thought they were all terrific i recommend that any lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction add both the book and the dvd of tipping the velvet to their bookshelves 
ed harris and cuba gooding jr where cast perfectly in this film it s a heart warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care i think there was a lot of realism with the characters the screenwriter didn t incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do which i thought created a more realistic story line writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously ed harris should have been nominated for an academy award because he was great as a leader and coach realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping radio 
the man who knew too much is a remake of a film that alfred hitchcock made in england in with the same name in my opinion his later effort is far superior many critics and fans of alfred hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesn t have the spine tingling suspense of the original with peter lorre in both films the plot is essentially the same except the original is set in switzerland and the remake in marrakech it tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day vacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man that is very curious about their past it just so happens he s an agent that s looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader then he gets stabbed in a marrakeck market because of it being found out that he s a spy and proceeds to fall into stewart s arms dying he tells him the whole story of the assassination plot stewart and day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their son the film contains excellent performances by stewart and day in a straight dramatic role as worried and frightened parents this film proved that doris day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicals the direction by alfred hitchcock is top notch the film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute the scene in albert hall is a classic the original is so slow paced and drab i don t know how people can compare the two just watch the remake and you ll enjoy it i give the movie a out of 
i love this movie i watched it over and over when i rented it from netflix it had a lot of substance and meaning for me i think many people will enjoy it i have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say they are getting better and better in how they are presented they tend to have a more positive feel for the life style and feeling s of gay women its nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this society i think it is apparent that more and more movies with this theme will grace our theaters and tv screens many producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without hesitation 
i love the way he experiments ab tak chappan was a thrill to watch just as much satya and company was jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and nana patekar was at his best suchak was really irritating but i think he fit the character he was playing he had really ugly teeth the story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better i only wish he signs up urmila for his other up coming movies i think they are the best director and actress combination i have seen i have not seen naach as yet but i am looking forward for it i for some reason don t find antra maali that exciting to watch on the screen unlike urmila 
before i really slag this film off i just want to say i absolutely loved it firstly how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase you re right i m sure i was counting in the hundreds before i gave up and started watching the film again secondly what the hell is with those blue monkey things ok so the dansen family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie creatures and finally old faithful here will protect me hahaha 
so keira knightly is in it so automatically we compare this film to attonement aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning these films are totally different the actors work well i think one good thing is there is no memorable person they are a team if you want a film where things happen then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche s damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined this film have genuine interaction perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath no its not exciting but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in move you allow yourself to forget these stars and not to judge them as actors but let them become people you will truly ind yourself moved go on give it a go 
ok we were going along with the stereotypical bad orphanage experience and explaining to our son adopted from russia that this was over the top acting and dramatization so we could get to the dog playing soccer since he plays soccer but the last scene in which the dog goes back to his original owner put my son over the edge and he cried for minutes he s been replaced this from an elementary child i do not recommend this movie to any family that has an adopted child it displays adoption orphanages and adults badly and in the end even though they win the game the dog that the boy bonded with has to leave and this is too much please be wary if you have any adopted children and beware families with biological children because the impression of children who are adopted is not positive and paints a stereotype that is unhealthy and nasty the dog is cute but not enough to save our family s reaction to this movie 
i only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish my aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time and money wisely i also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage and want to publicize the fact that the director producer of these garbage films can t get away with it for very long we will find out who you are and will vote with out feet and wallets this film clearly falls into the garbage category the director and writer is john shiban it s always a bad sign when the writer is also the director maybe he wants two pay cheques he shouldn t get any so remember the name john shiban and if you see anything else by him forget it i won t say anything about the plot others have already i am a little worried by how much the director likes to zoom in to the poor girl s face when she is crying and screaming these long duration shots are a little worrying and may say something about the state of mind of mr shiban maybe he should get psychiatric help enough already it s crap don t waste your time on it 
i ve watched many short films in my day often i find them either too compressed throwing too much information at the viewer in the short amount of time they have to run too artsy or lacking a clear cut vision i can say none of these things about starcrossed in this review i ll do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers but i ll also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is brotherly incest as with any short film the story is fairly simple straightforward and easy to digest it s clear that the film attempts to shine a light one one of modern society s most deeply held taboos this film succeeds in every respect in the fifteen minutes of running time i found myself feeling a gamut of emotions with only a little dialog the viewer is rapidly pulled into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star crossed brothers from the opening scene set in their early childhood one can see the very close relationship the brothers have when the film progresses to the present day in the next scene the excellent acting and honest heartfelt performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and harsh way as the relationship progresses any disgust the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible resolution and the aftermath of that resolution is heart rending anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this film and absorb its message if nothing else it boldly and honestly challenges the viewer to reexamine some of our deepest beliefs on the shame filled and secretive taboo of incest though the film is only fifteen minutes long it resonates in the viewer long after the credits roll this is perhaps my favorite short film i ve ever seen i can t recommend it highly enough 
there s some nice scenery to look at here if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see any of it i m a big fan of slice of life movies but these people are just plain bland although there s nothing political here the entire film can be looked at as a political statement in that it shows how communism destroys the individual making everyone the same bland animal that just spends its life sleeping eating and occasionally making love 
this hokey movie left me groaning after just about any exchange of dialogue or plot complication patricia arquette though pleasing to look at gives a below par performance from her usual mediocrity my friends and i have coined the phrase beyond rangoon to mean anything really bad a lowpoint for boorman 
the original australian kath kim is brilliant why do american producers need to remake ruin yet another classic show remember the original version of the office with ricky gervais it was an absolute masterpiece and there was no need to remake it the producers said that the british humour from the office and the australian humour from kath kim would not translate to an american audience what so basically they are saying that americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes so they need to remake the shows with over the top childish gags so that the americans can understand the humour the original australian version of kath kim is fantastic and very funny avoid the american version like the plague 
i can t help but forget that incredible scene in alien when the extra terrestrial burst out of one of the men s chest or even in predator when the invisible monster snuck upon the bewildered soldiers and cut them to pieces both these movies expressed fascinating ideas on the run of the mill creature feature back track to the era of cheesy b movies and watch big men in phony suits parading around killing people in small towns now recognize that the two movies above revolutionized this genre the cave does nothing to improve on it it tries nothing new and worst of all the cave doesn t even have good gore shame on them shame on them all parading around in sexy spandex are the one dimensional characters of the cave all of which seem to not care when they witness the death of their colleagues they just stroll along unbeknownst to the evil creature lurking in the darkness the plot is very easy to understand so you got the two brothers the black guy and the sexy female scientist the rest by the rest i mean all of those meet grisly demises are even more unexciting then the others we have the korean assistant the risky outdoor chick a russian scientist and two divers both lacking a sense of emotion and are stupid enough to wander off by themselves this movie exceeds to be extremely clich d since everybody but the black guy one of the brothers and the female scientist meet an end it also seems only americans can survive the terror since the russian and the korean die don t be offended if i give away details there s no real surprise anyway to be straight forward they find this cave they go in the cave they get stuck in the cave they start dying in the cave one of them gets infected in the cave more die in the cave they get out of the cave only to discover that one of them has a parasite that will turn them into a ghastly monster which really doesn t seem to bother them that s the simplicity of the lackluster plot it doesn t even try to be original it even has the part where they decide their leader isn t capable and split up we have just seen this way to many times before i know in a movie like this people don t care about the performances but it s worth mentioning how bad they were everyone is just so dreary cole hauser was especially unsophisticated and don t get me started on eddie cibrian who is frequently a lot better morris chestnut is hands down the best thing in the movie his performance is actually decent he portrays the guy who calms everybody down all the other actors are average at best in a show like this that s really not a bad thing now to the reason we go to this genre of film the action of course well to my regret the action was dull the death scenes are all boring hell the whole movie was there is barely any blood at all it s either they disappear and found later or they are attack and die without a bruise seeing the koreans man s death was the only exciting action i could find it s pretty amazing the bad things over shadow most of the things that are good a good example is to say the special effects were well done which they were the only thing wrong is that since everything takes place in a cave it s going to be dark i found it extremely hard to distinguish between the cave walls and the monsters so it was pretty hard to even see the creatures although i liked the special effects there was nothing original about the monsters they all resembled each other and they weren t frightening at all the cave marks the directorial debut for bruce hunt i don t see what he was trying to accomplish by making this film he obviously made a huge mistake almost everything about this movie stunk like a stink bomb a stink bomb is probably even more pleasurable than watching this mess again only the most forgiving moviegoer will find this forgivable i gave up all hope in the middle of the film when i heard the phrase what the hell was that for the third time 
it s not really about wine no nossiter s real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local wine production for business purposes to this end he has made an excellent objective film spirited bumptious emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media finessed anodynesprech amercians and auld europeans the art of wine making against market driven laboratorised product manufacture it s an open show that doesn t lead conclusion nossiter s film is occasionally infuriating to watch cameras are neither concealed nor steadicam by any means there are also plenty of captions as well as subtitles to wade through often too short a time on screen however it does outdo michael moore at the game moore can t play anyway the characters speak for and therefore condemn themselves well worth a viewing 
this movie was an excellent acted excellent directed and overall had an excellent story ive had real life experiance with a boy like radio at the football program in my town weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice travel and have fun with the football team this movie is really true and i can identify with it a boy like radio just needs to feel like they belong to something they need to feel like their life is worth living thats how radio feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school this is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen my dad and i loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man 
screened this morning for the press at roma film festival n io e napoleone is easy to love first of all it can count on great production values as very few italian films nowadays can with wonderful settings and costumes the cast is great too director virz constantly speaks of the young lead elio germano as a young de niro now of course he is going a way too far but sure the boy can act i loved his performance and he did a great job with the tuscan accent daniel auteuil is a great actor and did very well as bonaparte it s really great to see him acting in italian i hope to see him working in italy again very soon the supporting cast worked well too people like valerio mastrandrea or sabrina impacciatore may seem unlikely choices but they all gave fine performances even massimo ceccherini best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy tv reality shows fitted in well and was actually funny the low point of the cast was the diva monica bellucci sure she was slightly better than usual but she managed to look and sound utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa emilia in which with a good dose of self irony she used her own umbro accent the script by veteran furio scarpelli and virz himself is clever with lots of laugh out loud lines and a few very emotional moments too sure the ending left me puzzled the message is kind of ambiguous the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else sometimes funny sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that suddenly it s difficult to hate him then in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning personally i dislike very much this notion io e napoleone is still a pleasant film the best presented at the festival so far the other being fur and the hoax my rating is 
i ve always been fascinated by ninjistsu who would know that it will go further than beyond in ninja iii it s fun creepy and intriguing a ninja gets shot up by the police and uses his spirit for revenge the victim a lovely young woman named christie lucinda dickey she falls for the cop who was involved in the shooting the love scene where she pours the v on her body knocked me out the ninja s death gets the attention of another in japan named yamada sho kosugi he comes to america not only to save christie but to put the ninja back to the grave simply because he put out yamada s left eye with a shuriken throwing star the fight scenes were excellent i liked the part when the plywood falls on yamada and he splits it with his foot and when he was caught he tells the officer christie was involved with that everything will be fine rule of thumb never under estimate a ninja he took out the other cops without killing them and he did his thing without worry of course chirstie did her best trying to put the ninja in his place for using her a tool for revenge it was a good movie great for martial arts buffs out of stars 
maybe it s just that it was made in or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a has a soft spot for kids with aids but really people the maniacal laughter mayhem during the withdrawal scene did you not see that coming i m surprised there was no baby crawling across the ceiling and sickboy addressing the camera the acting was fine sure but to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language things happen but that s it there s no glue or motive that can be detected on screen allowing the subject matter to use pre existing emotional connections to furthur the plot without the script doing it like it s supposed to 
this p of s was highly recommended to me by two friends that have great similar to mine taste in films and have seen more than anyone i know i have no idea what they saw in this movie sadistic cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie but this is a windbag effort trying to pass itself off as highbrow lowbrow movie making or is it lowbrow highbrow the ancient generation gap clich no redeeming social value comes to mind bill pullman is trying maybe a little to hard and except for the kid the rest of the acting seems self conscious and kinda lame save yourself from this and watch a double feature of in cold blood and the hitcher as somebody said this would never have been made if jennifer lynch was not the overrated david lynch s daughter 
we ve all played halo and socom and gta and resi etc but none of them can stand up to ge the game itself is great i have literally burned out my n playing this great game along with zelda oot this game along alone built the mold that is essential for all modern shooters on top of that the multi player is great the story mode itself is worth playing a hundred times over and more its a great game for when your board and you want to just shoot up some people and there are endless unlock ables cheats aztec egyptian god knows how many multiplayer charries and the three difficulties as well as the famous difficulty our modern games are great but when you sit down and play this game you get a certain feeling that few other games can give you and with the online capabilities of newer shooting games we rarely see this old two on two death match style and when we do its no where near as good as this games and when you get bored of the story there are endless mysteries glitches and easter eggs to be found and taken advantage of this is definitely one of the greatest shooting games of all time 
in out is a comedy with a simple premise it admirably succeeds in the mission of being funny and entertaining the comedy in this film ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime physical comedy exists alongside dry humor with a nice veteran turn by bob newhart kevin kline is predictably in excellent form in this film alongside tom selleck not playing to his expected square jawed leading man type mr selleck plays his humor well and displays a nice sense of comedic timing the cast makes this film successful not all films with homosexual themes are made to advance some sort of sinister hidden hollywood liberal agenda in point of fact this film was simply made to entertain and if any part of this films makes the viewer think then it was a byproduct of the well acted work by a terrific cast of professionals frequently tongue in cheek i found myself laughing at the right moments a solid b 
horrible acting with the worst special f x i ve ever bore witness too it s bad enough i wasted to watch this crummy pile of crap but it s the hour and a half time i lost that i could ve been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty getting drunk couldn t even help this video to put it bluntly i sincerely believe i actually lost a few iq points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind numbing work perhaps i should have followed my own advice this time never expect a decent film if it s written directed and produced by the same person and never ever expect anything of value from jeff fahey 
fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a mess plot wise and the acting of those who dubbed the voices is almost universally bad but the premise is engaging the fight scenes are fast and flashy and the movie is often quite amusing it s a shame the story is such a wreck there are a couple of places where i had no idea what just happened it was almost as though five minutes had just been cut out and you were suddenly at the next scene without knowing how you d got there the movie is poor at explaining things and some things don t make a lot of sense but the movie moves along breezily so its flaws barely register not a great movie by any means but definitely a fun one 
like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick we plundered the asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on leaving no dark haired ghost lady unturned we had good reason to do so the asian market had spawned such terrifying wonders as ringu dark waters juon the grudge and a tale of two sisters by the time takashi miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with one missed call in the market seemed to be drying up leaving it open for mockery and derision despite the continued hollywood remake machine working full steam ahead now don t get me wrong there were still plenty of good asian horrors being made the likes of marebito and shutter to mention but two will stand as minor genre classics some day but the lank haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party and was time to take that success drunk tramp home to bed then along comes a film like noroi the curse a film that is smart enough to pay subtle homage to it s roots yet throws the rulebook out the window whilst doing it what i m about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all the film is a documentary about one of japan s top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on he starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door yet there is no baby there apart from a middle aged woman and her son these two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around but strange other coincidences start popping up a psychic young girl a mentally ill clairvoyant a pretty young actress who had a strange vision a lot of dead pigeons and a very sinister demon by the name of kagutaba leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town to say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit the film is shot in faux documentary fashion and incorporates footage from tv shows and news reports and the labels via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line the film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the blair witch project but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night the comparison ends there really what is refreshing about noroi is how it doesn t pander to modern horror audiences if you are expecting croaky ghost ladies to pop out of the attic look elsewhere the film s strength lies in it s slow gradual build up of terror a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it the climax is pretty damned freaky but just when you think the film is over you get treated to the real ending when the credits start to roll and sweet holy f ck is it a killer in terms of acting it is mostly convincing you get some comedy relief from the crazy tin foil covered clairvoyant but that soon dries up half way through the film the film also has a slightly nastier feel than a lot of asian ghost horror as there is a violent streak to some of the events too overall noroi is one to watch on your own late at night not since my first viewing of ringu ten years ago have i been so delightfully creeped out watching a horror film it is one that will itch away at you until it is too late then it is under your skin just let yourself go to this one completely and not a lank haired ghost lady in sight no wonder it has barely been released outside of japan let alone had an american remake lined up yet check this one out if you can essential viewing in my books 
bone eater is set in a small desert town in alabama where property developer dick krantz jim storm is financing the building of a huge resort late one night three of his workers riley timothy starks hansen adrian alvarado miller paul rae are digging foundations in the desert when they unearth what looks like a tomahawk axe unfortunately for them an ancient native american demon called the bone eater comes along kills them local sheriff steve evans bruce boxleitner soon has krantz breathing down his neck as the construction of his resort grinds to a halt sheriff evans also has to deal with the bone eater demon as it kills anyone it comes across you know i consider myself a fairly big fan of the horror sci fi genre i certainly don t think my opinion is worth more than anyone else s unlike many here on the imdb but please believe me when i say that bone eater is the worst sci fi channel creature feature i have ever seen it s up against some damned strong competition as a horror sci fi fan there are two names that when involved with a film send shudders down my spine in anticipation of how bad it will turn out those names are jesus i have no talent franco who had nothing to do with bone eater jim wynorski who directed the absolute disaster that is bone eater in fact bone eater is so bad wynorski hid under the pseudonym bob robertson when a director as bad as wynorski hides under a pseudonym you know the film must be bad where do i even start bone eater is quite simply the worst film i have seen this year is so bad it s untrue the story is awful the script is sloppy at one point sheriff evans tells kia to meet him at the hospital but when they meet there later he acts surprised says what are you doing here at one point sheriff evans triumphantly claims that we are in the twentieth century that ancient native american demons are nonsense although actually we are in the twenty first century now there s a part when a woman tells in flashback the story where three men awaken the bone eater it kills them but since it killed all three of them how did anyone else know about it for it to be passed down in legend at times it gets more than a little bit embarrassing the character s are horrible clich s the small town sheriff who saves the day his daughter becomes involved which adds some personal motivation as for the native americans there s an old wise man a young hot head who hates white man a young woman who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like storm cloud black hawk the film is as boring as hell nothing happens the story is awful it s full of plot holes lapses in any sort of logic the set pieces are terrible there s no horror or gore or suspense or mystery bone eater is just the sort of film that makes you lose the will to live bone eater has some of the worst cgi computer effects i ve seen in a while from the daft looking stiff moving bone eater creature itself which is just a selection of bones magically held together to a motorbike jumping a large gap to an awful cgi truck crashing over the edge of a cliff to a van being tossed to one side by the bone eater whenever the bone eater needs to get some speed up he causes a large horse to form from the sand dust rides it in principal this is actually quite a neat idea but it looks awful the scenes even have cheesy cowboy music on the soundtrack there is one pointless scene at the end when sheriff evans cuts his own arm why it bleeds but apart from that there isn t a single drop of blood in the thing whenever the bone eater kills someone they usually just disappear in a cloud of dust boring the hilariously goofy climatic showdown between sheriff evans the bone eater has to be seen to be believed sheriff evans goes native on horseback complete with tribal war paint on his face while the bone eater also rides his dust horse they have a sort of jousting contest which is just to bad to describe properly with a supposed budget of about bone eater is filmed in a very bland forgettable flat way there s no sense of style here at all the majority of the film takes place in bright sunlight if you watch it on a decent telly then the desert scenery is quite nice on occasion there are several veteran known actors really slumming it here boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the similarly themed but much better creature feature snakehead terror william katt will obviously put his name to any crap as long as he gets paid while ex star trek man walter koenig must be really desperate to agree to appear in this bone eater is a truly atrocious creature feature there s really not much more you can say about it other than to steer well clear of it the worst film ever to appear on the sci fi channel that s saying something isn t it 
as with footprints i became aware of this one purely by accident it was mentioned in a review of the libertine which i researched when that film turned up on late night italian tv as being in a similar vein incidentally i missed out on that screening of the libertine though i acquired it via the same channel later on but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the english dubbed r dvd during my sojourn in hollywood in late early actually in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it i was let down by the libertine being too light hearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme the sado masochistic relationship between a young couple to be honest for much of the time i was afraid that the frightened woman would go the exact same route but was subsequently amply redeemed by a wicked if not exactly unpredictable final twist the film concerns the freethinking social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era an eminent philanthropist philippe leroy invites a female journalist dagmar lassander at his fashionable home for the week end however it transpires that he s a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate or even kill them therefore for the first half of the narrative we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at leroy s hands including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own image until the tables are subtly but unsurprisingly turned she not only emancipates herself from his control but teaches him that man and woman can co exist harmoniously except that lassander s following her own personal agenda as well the leads are perfectly cast and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood furthermore it s greatly abetted by a typically effervescent euro cult score from the ever reliable stelvio cipriani and the imaginative even outr look the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form with a steel trap where its sexual organ should be seems to emanate from freud incidentally this prop figured prominently in stills i d seen previously from the frightened woman but it barely registers in the film proper other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program sexual aberrations and the stars and an idyll at a castle belonging to leroy s family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarfish manservant one of the highlights then is easily lassander s erotic dance virtually in the nude an episode which actually spearheads the humanization of leroy eventually the two characters have a showdown in the latter s pool amusingly set to a spaghetti western type theme in the long run for all its stylishness the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporaneous japanese masterpiece by yasuzo masumura blind beast finally it s worth noting that the frightened woman was distributed in the u s by film maker radley metzger s company audubon films he would even employ its production designer enrico sabbatini for his own camille to get to the edition i watched apart from the usual shortcomings in the english dubbing department the presentation here was further marred by a rather washed out appearance and brief instances of distracting extraneous noise on the soundtrack by the way there seems to be some confusion with respect to the film s running time its length given on various sources ranges anywhere from to minutes all i can say however is that the copy i own ran for minutes 
this is an adaptation of a dirk wittenborn book which i did not read young finn earl lives with his mom liz diane lane in a cramped lower east side new york apartment he dreams of joining his anthropologist father studying a fierce tribe in south america liz has boyfriends and does coke when he is caught scoring coke for her one of her customers liz is a legitimate masseuse a rich mr osborne bails her out in return for being his full time personal masseuse in his huge estate in new jersey they are driven there in a limo with her strung out lying in the back seat with her dress hitched way up and panties showing this and a few low cut dress scenes is the only exploitation of ms lane some may be disappointed but i m sorry she had to do all that stuff in unfaithful to make the a list that lady has more talent in her little finger than streep roberts and sally field do in their entire bodies and its time she was given her due when they arrive finn makes friends with osbornes grandson bryce and has a coming of age with his new girlfriend granddaughter maya liz meanwhile joins aa and dates an aa doctor she miraculously cleans up instantly finn however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends bryce seems like an ok guy but gets jealous when osborne takes finn on a hot air balloon race instead of him and this leads to tragedy the genius of the story and movie is that they cut from the violent acts of the fierce filthy rich blysdale tribe to the yanomano warriors it s a little implausible though that when liz finds out what happens to her son she merely demands action from osborne and does not either contact the authorities or settle it thelma and louise style there are elements of a gothic romance with a revelation by the village idiot also they do almost no plot or character development prior to the move to blysdale liz for instance like lane s pearl kantrowitz in walk on the moon had an unwanted pregnancy with finn at and felt trapped this is in the book but not the movie still these are minor shortcomings the movie will be in full release over a year after the original release date and i just couldn t wait there were lots of red carpet moments in the theater i saw the movie at with almost the whole cast except diane lane q director dunne said she was off filming a movie i know she didn t promise to be there but i came from way out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her in person the movie is a definite best picture contender as for acting sutherland was quite good and so was the boy who played finn lane was magnificent as always but i only recall one or two emotional scenes when she catches finn with drugs lets get f d up together mother and son and with osborne your twisted grandson she would fare better with a supporting actress nod but it wont work that way unless they give it to her for a body of work 
as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time second only to the breakfast club the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time it s underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people it comes on tbs maybe once a year but sometimes longer the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious with only a few comic scenes in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time i ve never heard this many great songs in one movie before there are love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin hes in high school who has a couple of best friends his two friends are sex sarved teens the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures that are very funny gary is major in love with the new girl in school he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her he also cheats on the side you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much you can feel it even more in the second half gary s friend turns out to be a creep but his other friend is pretty cool the movie shows how mean people can be you can relate to a lot of this movie the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy but it s so much more than that it s a very honest movie it s also very ish which i love if you love the s or grew up in the s rent this movie but there may be some people that don t like the s but still may like this movie i first saw this movie back in i think it s very entertaining and very funny it combines very touching moments with very funny moments it s an underrated gem i have the movie i love it i give the last american virgin out of 
ben rupert grint is a deeply unhappy adolescent the son of his unhappily married parents his father nicholas farrell is a vicar and his mother laura linney is well let s just say she s a somewhat hypocritical soldier in jesus army it s only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul mouthed eccentric once famous and now forgotten actress evie walton julie walters that he finally finds himself in true harold and maude fashion of course evie is deeply unhappy herself and it s only when these two sad sacks find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness of course it s corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it too and walters who could sleep walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted is excellent it s when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink that she s at her best the problem is she s the only interesting character in the film and it s not because of the script which doesn t do anybody any favours grint on the other hand isn t just unhappy he s a bit of a bore as well while linney s starched bitch is completely one dimensional still she s got the english accent off pat the best that can be said for it is that it s mildly enjoyable with the emphasis on the mildly 
this outstanding film has about the best acting that you ll ever see and that alone makes this a must see the entire cast is excellent but then again it had to be in order to keep up with dustin hoffman and meryl streep it didn t take me long to get hooked on this film and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good this is top notch entertainment this is a rare film that actually deserved all the oscar recognition that it received see it for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed 
not to be confused with michael ritchie s nasty beauty pageant spoof this smile is a down turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell the film parallels two stories an impoverished chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially deformed orphan named ling yi ding and a tv spawned malibu family act out gidget get birth control katie mika booram the third olsen twin plays a spoiled self absorbed high schooler distanced from reality her teacher sean astin paves the way for a school trip to china aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children the film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating ling like the frankenstein monster kramer continually masks her deformity through hats hoods and camera placement this approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material she may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and kramer s answer is to cover her up until the big reveal why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness we see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the harelip it is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live what is imperative is ling being equally as hot and popular as katie funding for the film came from a trust established by the late roy rogers and dale evans they envisioned a heritage of quality family films give me son of paleface any day 
i of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other lion s gate extravaganza so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing and it is to a point a young college student sarah is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them and in doing so she s unwittingly becoming involved in some game now that s fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer like myself will most likely become frustrated characters appear with little introduction and you re not really sure who they are or why sarah knows them or is hanging out with them all of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that it s all part of the design in reality it s all part of the very sketchy script and when the film is over you ll find yourself feeling that you ve lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time like cleaning the bathroom for instance out of 
was in the mood for a french film and saw this at blockbuster what a little gem it turned out to be not sure how i missed gregori derangere all these years but he is fantastic such innocence and grace i love his face and the way he moves isabelle adjani was hilarious reminded me of nicole kidman s over the top performance in moulin rouge she looks the same as years ago truly remarkable gerard depardieu has not held up nearly as well but his acting continues to amaze he s perfect in this film will probably buy this one i enjoyed it so much if you want to see another great french movie rent joyeux noel stunning 
i attended a screening of this movie it was wrought with clich s and very unfunny jokes and set ups i think the other comments were by people who must ve worked on the movie or been family members of the cast i m amazed this movie cost million without any real stars where did the budget go it obviously didn t go to writers for re writes nice thought to bank on the success of big fat greek wedding but a major miss there was little or any spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best the direction was uninspired and looked like a student film i don t even know what it means everybody wants to italian is that a real saying i ve never heard it 
am i the only person who believes this american version is far better than the english film the english version has no suspense looks antique and very low budget and has unexceptional acting except for peter lorre the version besides having top production values shows james stewart as the perfect innocent american abroad and gives doris day her best role ever of particular note is the music the music of the american film is almost classic compare the albert hall sequences of both and you will agree that the bernard herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version even though it s basically the same music the only flaw in the film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop i would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the english version is better 
the three part series ended last night on pbs which i believe was its first wide exposure to an american audience the richness of its text and the unique quality of its filming are high points it seems very novel to view and hear an action play employing the vernacular of georgian england jane austen s filmed drawing rooms being the primary example of that form of speech yet it is the scope of drama overwhelming the senses that makes quaint language fit perfectly into each and every scene such bold exposure to an old reality is evocative of literary giants like tolstoy or shakespeare while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a c s forester or patrick o brian sea saga the universality of basic human condition lies at its center narrator talbot as played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of benedict cumberbatch surely not even dickens could beat that one alternates between stodgy jingoism and extreme vulnerability an acting tour de force indeed i cannot recall among this very fine cast any misstep of interpretation that is a tribute not only to the actors themselves but to the director as well the most impressive element however is how perfectly life aboard a man of war en route to australia in the early s is presented that is especially true of how the motion of the ship becomes almost a character itself something sea stories rarely take into account except as backdrop anyone who has ever experienced mal de mer in person will recognize it instantly and appreciate all the more how difficult it must have been to recreate within the context of filming this is no fanciful pirates of the caribbean some effort must be expended in attaining an understanding of its nuances 
see dick work see jane work dick and jane are married they are successful they have a son they have a nice house they have a latino housekeeper the housekeeper teaches spanish to the son the son speaks spanish ha ha see dick get promoted the pompous ceo is a crook see dick take the fall for the pompous ceo jane quits her job oops see dick and jane out of work dick jane turn to crime as a plot device they decide to rob the ceo see the robbery get botched see dick jane fund the company s pension plan with the money from the robbery yay see the end credits okay so you ve got the plot beyond that dick and jane careens from one scene to the next one barely connecting with the last one or the next one the whole thing is terribly episodic in nature jim carrey didn t bother to bring his a material he just seems bored and slightly ashamed of the whole thing but heck when you re getting paid million plus why bother tea leoni is frantic i guess i would be frantic not to get blamed for this flop there s just something sort of off about dick jane carrey and leoni aren t funny and have little chemistry the script isn t funny and it s not well plotted but it may be bigger than that the reality of dick and jane is perhaps a little too real maybe it s just not funny for people to lose their jobs in an enron like situation when real life still lacks a happy ending 
many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare however every so often a movie might come along thats honest funny entertaining and memorable the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients this film follows three friends gary rick and david the big apple misadventures into the world of first time sex and true love along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship we follow hopeless romantic gary the main character on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it s ending if you haven t been lucky enough to see this movie yet by all means take a look sprinkled with many memorable s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace l a v truly is an original film a rarity among films of it s genre 
can you capture the moment when first you hear rain on a roof some things are beyond the sum of their parts expressing the poetry of life the things that matter poet dylan thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible a good poem helps to extend everyone s knowledge of himself and the world around him bob dylan named himself after him so why has it taken so long to make a film of the great dylan thomas a simple biopic could have missed the point writer sharman macdonald has taken a different better approach in the edge of love she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them the lives of four friends dylan who lusts and loves to the full wife caitlin sienna miller his feisty support war hero william cillian murphy who saves him from a street brawl and then there s his childhood sweetheart vera dear vera take your breath away vera she s caitlin s closest friend william s wife and like a muse the star in dylan s dark sky it all kicks off in the london blitz with bomb shelters in the underground enter vera an impressive keira knightley under makeshift stage spotlights she meets dylan for the first time again in years her heart is flushed their eyes shine through the smoke of the room the purity of their former passion dylan native welsh speaker matthew rhys is no sanctified sanitised poet master of his vices he must experience them all fully he introduces his beloved wife then continues to woo vera the edge of love is a visual treat the soundtrack leaves you wanting for more performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers as a lush love story it s pretty good as an insight into dylan thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives not bad at all and as a tribute to a great man inspiring the production has been at pains to project the spirit of dylan thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed and it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of albert square sharman macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer rebekah gilbertson granddaughter of the real william and vera think of all the things that you don t want me to write about she said because i have to have carte blanche for macdonald the limits were if she should cause offence to dylan s memory but for many artists especially men the limits are those which wife and family could set on them a woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues and will even put her children s interests before her own this occasionally happens the other way round as when towering genius virginia woolf refused to let loving leonard bring her down to earth in the hours in spite of the tension between caitlin and vera these two women become closest buddies it is one of the main and very beautiful themes of the film the film s colours tell a story in themselves in a drab wartime britain caitlin and vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey shortly after meeting vera s lit up in lights stage persona we encounter caitlin through her searing blue eyes sparkling in a darkened railway carriage her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless homogeneity triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with dylan but vera s lipstick red brightness is less enduring for her marriage is second best even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images in a manner similar to poetry s juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning horrific war scenes in thessaly are intercut with screams of vera in pregnancy giving birth or is it abortion we are not told immediately pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day constant echoes of dylan s poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites it reminds me of marlon brando reading ts eliot in apocalypse now a light beyond the horrors of the world a different way of seeing things i ll take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no one died ever says dylan to vera as they walk along the beach elsewhere caitlin recalls childhood with vera we re still innocent in dylan she says there s a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette not literally perhaps a time to be inspired enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year 
warning this could spoil your movie watch it see if you agree to think that we as humans can not learn from the past the futuristic society portrayed glamorized what hitler believed obliterate a race of people in this case men for the benefit of society it made me sick to my stomach also the plausibility of a y bomb is insane even in war our instinct for self preservation will prevent the extinction of humanity we made mistakes in the past ie japan hiroshima and nagasaki in but because of that we avoided a bigger mistake in during the cuban missile crisis
great movie good acting a wonderful script it s exciting to find out what the people are thinking and how they react on the situation they are in a pity about the ending a page of text of how nynke s life went on instead of moving images was a poor choice i hope this movie attracts a lot of people it s worth it 
this is awesome there is no partnership quite like errol and olivia there love is genuine i m yet this flick is as captivating now as i m sure it was years ago raoul walsh is an under rated genius his direction is so sweeping so broad yet so intimate the last scene between colonel custer flynn and his wife de havilland almost brought me to tears not easy for a yr old guy its so heart wrenching there is also a deep christian message implicit here the faith custer has in taking your glory with you and the trust and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go in order that he fulfils his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this a must see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in american and military history from the inside patriotic for all the right reasons i knew errol flynn was a star and de havilland was a screen legend this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest 
the time i wasted seeing this movie i demand back i felt sick afterward but not because it touched me in any way it s pretentious trying to get the audience to feel bad for the people involved but i couldn t care less the characters are soulless and stupid you don t get an explanation for some of the scenes and it doesn t leave any thoughts afterward to come up with your own explanation all of the students in the movie has issues but since you don t feel for them you don t believe their problems if i could write better in english i d never stop but i can t so i ll stop now don t watch this 
don t get me wrong i love stephen king and this is a pretty good movie over all the rabid cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful but after the first few minutes that poor donna and her little son tad were held captive in their pinto by the rabid st bernard i began to wonder why she didn t do something to help herself she could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards i mean it was a pinto for pete s sake and they were on a downhill incline and rolled to safety but then it would have been a very short movie when she got the car started did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway no she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad alternator she did manage to get out of the car and look around for seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby what a waste of time i mean if you re going to make a run for the bat do it and at least you ll have something to hit the dog with but forget the bat were there no tools in the car like a tire iron or something i didn t see her looking in the spare tire well of the car really why wait until you re bitten and weak from dehydration and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal at the end of the movie she was battered and torn but by god she was still wearing high heels 
when i borrowed this movie i wasn t expecting a high quality performance but this was just sad most of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldn t easily get into this movie if you tried there s nothing quite like seeing a kid announce things like oh no my dad is invisible or i wonder what this does in the same monotone that one might announce traffic advisories over the radio with there are some good actors but they are wasted on smaller parts the story is decent though it would be fairly easy to guess considering that there aren t too many real plot changes lots of holes too for example the dad is invisible and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again so the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store couldn t he just ask his dad for the cash this shows up in the comedy category but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb like the invisible dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting or walking around with his head covered at all times funny at first but it gets old because it is watchable and it s one of those movies that are funny in their own way like the monotone recitation of lines 
cooley high is considered one of my best all time movies it certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of cleveland and chicago during the early mid and late s what ever happened to brenda and pooter some one need s to track those two down brenda for her beauty and pooter for his innocent wit they both deserve to be recognized even years after this film was debuted i think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie i certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of movie hall of fame all of the cast of this movie was great my opinion is of cooley high is turn back the hands of time those were the fun years 
over the weekend i watched the movie tipping the velvet and if i was to have to score this movie out of i would have to give it no question asked i am a true believer in true love and this movie moved me in alot of different ways and the actors fit the parts without a doult but i have to say that the ending was not so great for i did not see that spark in nancys eyes when ever she looked into flo s eyes as her eyes sparked each time she looked at kitty kitty only had to be in the room or in nancy s thought and nancy would just glow fron that spark kitty told nancy that she could not find her and that she looked for her but could not find her kitty was ready to give it all up to get nancy back in kitty s eyes you could see kitty s pain i believe that nancy should have let kitty see that thier love is true and strong and that she would not let her go that easy you need to make a part two and have the two make it together but you must not let anyone else play the roles it has to be the real kitty nancy or it ll never work my mother once told me that true love is just not real i am no fool i know that we all have a true love out someplace just waiting for each of us and i believe with my life that nancy s true love really is only kitty and kitty s true love is only nancy come on lets play the game the right way the only way let nancy s eyes shine again kitty lost her everything by losing nancy and kitty is not to be the only one to blame i am gay myself and being gay is not easy wake up in i d not want to be gay kitty was lost deep inside herself and in maybe the right thing to do was to be married to a man even though you love a woman kitty needed nancy to stand up to her needed nancy to fight for her myself i remember how deeply i loved this girl and i let her get away because i thought i was doing something wrong and i went back to my ex boyfriend i thought i was doing the right thing but i know i was wrong to let go of her and i will pay for the rest of my days for like kitty i could not find her anyplace i heard that she is married to a man in the u s a someplace i even heard that he beats her i guess in the end we both lose give the two girls one more chance life can be very lonely if you are not true to you and your loved one thank you kristen ann
i caught this one on cable and i was very surprised steady direction and some good performances accent a twisty and very engaging story this one will keep you up all night thinking about what was real and what wasn t check out jason scott lee in the lou diamond phillips role 
i was not old enough to really appreciate the original mod squad but i knew everyone thought it was cool i have some of the books that were written based on the series in my screen to print collection and they re pretty light duty so i didn t expect much from the movie that s a good thing because this movie was bad on a long leash i admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the s hit the movie audience though has gained sophistication in years at least i think so i certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original mod squad concept with now old car chases now considered poor camera work tinny sounding soundtrack and poor script and all on the big screen in the s we didn t care as much because we had minimal expectations an integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough it was that another thrilling episode of ironsides or password rating this episode against usual theatre releases the story was well i m not sure i should even say because i m not sure there was one drugs are bad whatever the script was silly when the characters are exchanging dialog and advancing the plot with lines like i overheard him say so on the phone and i think i got a plan we really are in trouble no wonder the acting was dreadful no one knew how to say such idiotic lines if i were claire danes i d be going after my agent with a flame thrower right now actually i think everyone in and watching the film has a right to seek retribution and where was the mod in that squad i realize these kids just got out of juvenile hall but no one had a velvet suit mod only meant young and integrated what happened to white go go boots perhaps the costume department was going for gritty but all they got was dirty and dingy since the movie was completely true to the original series and required special behavior from the actors cameramen stunt men etc we should appreciate it more unfortunately i still don t like it if i wanted to watch s crime drama i d buy dvds no thanks 
 kramer vs kramer is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son the husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy as he does they get to know each other better but then the mother and wife returns and she wants custody of the boy kramer vs kramer has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure dustin hoffman won his first best actor oscar for his brilliant performance here most people say his performance in rainman which won him his second oscar is his best he was great in that film but i disagree that its his best in my opinion the best performance of hoffman s career is in this movie scene after scene shows us why hoffman is one of the best american actors working today he s also funny at times also giving a terrific performance is meryl streep who wasn t as well known when she made this film like she is today streep like hoffman also won her first oscar for best supporting actress for her work in kramer vs kramer as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family justin henry who was only years old when the film came out is wonderful as hoffman and streep s son he won an oscar nomination for his role here and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an oscar nomination in a competitive category best supporting actor jane alexander is also fine as a conserned family friend she too got an oscar nomination for supporting actress where she lost to co star streep kramer vs kramer is a great film from start to finish writer director robert benton has made a film that s absolutely unforgettable out of four 
this bbc version of an agatha christie book shows the pitfalls of following a book too closely christie s books tend to move at a gentle sometimes even sedate pace and evans is one that certainly does it also has a solid school of red herrings to confuse the plot this version is extremely faithful to the book which results in a very slow involved story as a christie fan i gave it stars but it takes hours to make its way through a relatively action free story i appreciate some of the tightening of plots that the bbc did for its later christie productions much more in the end this movie is a leisurely pleasure highlighted by the breathy waif francesca annis who brings considerable charisma to her role and plays off james warwick very well 
i just got home from seeing radio i ve not seen such an inspiring story in a long time my kids are ages and and i would like to take them so that they may feel the message as i did you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are not judge them for their differences cuba gooding jr and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie i don t know why we can t have more movies like this rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis 
i found the first bit of stop motion animation intriguing and the mostly live action short with the girl going about in whatever country it was kept my interest but the other odd shorts really didn t pique my interest or make me think of anything at all the music and mm footage all seemed to be so random that it all just seemed random i would not recommend this to any one unless you get to see it free as for the music being so in step that didn t come across either i rented the dvd because i thought it was all stop motion animation or sma mixed with live action and only the first short was sma the second had a little stop motion mixed with mostly live action there was paper cut out stuff in one and the rest was outdoor shots from an mm camera with the music bed just didn t have any meaning to it i could see 
no this has nothing to do with the sitcom seinfeld or its eccentric and hilarious character cosmo kramer in reality kramer vs kramer is a fine drama movie without a doubt one of the finest of its kind and one of the greatest movies ever i m glad that it won more oscars than apocalypse now because it really deserved such glory kramer vs kramer is an excellent film so well made and so perfectly balanced that i wouldn t change anything about it in any way there is nothing wrong with the film it s film making of the highest quality and it stands the test of time too not only it doesn t look any dated but also its cultural impact is long lasting and its realistic story remains just as significant as it was when it came out in a timeless classic they don t make movies like this today this movie is dramatic realistic simple but brilliant intense powerful sweet and even tragic and depressing sometimes yet it has fine humor as well it has no special effects but who cares this is not the movie or place to discuss such thing for a movie like this such thing would be pointless and absolutely unnecessary the story is very interesting the actors s chemistry is just perfect all of the actors are great but the main ones are the very best dustin hoffman a brilliant actor has his greatest performance ever here as the lovable but distant workaholic ted kramer meryl streep is great as ted s wife joanna and cute little justin henry is terrific as the loving but sometimes stubborn billy son of ted and joanna the soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful the opening song by the guitarist frederic hand is brilliant the rest of the soundtrack is mostly antonio vivaldi s classical music and is simply dazzling this motion picture has also an incredible development of the characters see the character ted kramer a workaholic who becomes an amazing father after being left with no choice but to take care of his son trying to adjust these new responsibilities with his job after being left by his wife joanna with this ted learns about the most beautiful things in life but also realizes how though life is with the problems in his job and the return of joanna who wants the custody of their son but even joanna changes for better and the ending is an unexpected surprise when one sees this for the first time this movie has also some though things such as courtroom scenes where both ted and joanna face brutal character assassinations unleashed by the lawyers another though thing to see is when poor billy falls off a jungle gym with his toy a plane and gets seriously injured on his face but then again the scene is very well made and what comes next is very intense his father runs quickly and crosses numerous blocks ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital overall this is a movie which is a good lesson of life this should definitely be on top 
i absolutely loved this show never understood why it was called bug juice though i must have been about when it came out i remember they ran it over the summer holidays on channel between re runs of pugwalls summer and saved by the bell or something like that i remember sitting there and wishing i was at summer camp too ha ha all the kids in it looked to be having so much fun it was all about discovering who you are and growing up first kisses and all that stuff i remember there was this really cute guy in it i think he was the main reason i got up in the mornings that particular summer they should have more teen docu soaps like this i thought it was great 
veteran tv director ted post treats us to a plodding confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from column b of the harold robbins big book of plots set against a smoggy phoenix skyline post charlies angles jaclyn smith takes a star turn as the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times while jfk impersonator james franciscus lounges around the fringes mannix goes western monkeys are abused models lean against classic cars and smith is constantly upstaged by sybil danning until a giallo style wrap up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end oh yeah and bob mitchum is in there too somewhere 
i m not sure what version of the film i saw but it was very entertaining i did not know who the twins were gillian chung and charlene choi before seeing this movie and i think the english translation of the title is somewhat misleading the martial arts are very nicely done i especially liked them because there was a lot of judo grappling that was filmed very nicely donnie yen see him in hero great performance as a director is great as he knows how to shoot these scenes everything seemed to flow for me except there is one scene where the girls are on the rooftop fighting with bamboo poles it has really nothing to do with the plot but it s still entertaining overall this is one of the better modern hk action flicks i ve seen in a while although cheesy in some respects it still pulls it off definitely a 
i love this film it is excellent and so funny ben is fit and i wouldn t mind meeting him on holiday i rate this film a because its gr and i hope they never re make it because it would never be the same funny bit is wen andre is looking at the moon and he shouts at nicole to come outside and look at the moon that bit always makes me laugh and never gets old another thing is nicole looks a lot older then but shes a gr actress but i need help with something does n e no the name of the song played at the end wen nicole and andre are dancing its really bugging me because i want no what it is because its a nice song 
cuba gooding jr will win the oscar for best actor in and ed harris will win for best supporting actor what a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesn t get to you then you have ice water in your veins it was the setting was in south carolina and the civil rights act was about ten years old we have a white high school football coach and teacher ed harris then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow cuba gooding whose greatest possessions including a radio are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle ed harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film he gives cuba the nickname radio and what follows is an absoutely riveting engrossing poignant exploration of the human soul the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece 
in the first twenty minutes we are swept away by several powerfully portrayed emotions a suffocating and overbearing mother has a violent argument with her live in yr old daughter a piano teacher and professor of music s love for her pupils expressed in unswerving critical appraisal the joy that music can inspire both in the listener and the performer within this short space of time our senses have been assaulted convincingly with very real characters we are also swept away by powerfully performed music and shown the difference between great and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuance such material alone would have been the basis for an outstanding film of widespread appeal but the trend in french cinema being what it is it goes deeper exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent breakdown within a context of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle of real abuse we are drawn to her suffering and at least initially wonder how much suffering may be related to the accomplishment of genius particularly in the composers she admires the piano teacher contains graphic dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people might rather not watch the scenes are essential to the dilemmas which the film seeks to raise and so can hardly be called gratuitous a great film it may be but mainstream viewing it is not 
there are few movies that have the massive amount of non stop ninja action as ninja iii the domination this is a story of love redemption and revenge however this is mainly a story about flipping out and killing people for no reason at all if you ve been searching for a movie where a ninja goes absolutely nuts and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because he s a ninja and he can do it this is the movie for you i can t think of any movies to compare this to because no movie is this awesome wait oh have you ever seen the thing with two heads there is a part in that where the titular thing is riding around on a motorcycle and about a million cop cars are chasing it them around but they keep crashing and what not because you can t catch the thing with two heads well that is kind of what ninja iii is like i highly recommend this film especially if you like the following things ninjas swords lucinda dickie from breakin and breakin electric boogaloo video games about being a bouncer in a bar ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or good ninjas 
this movie is somehow showing stars it seems inconceivable that the director has that many relations i am at a loss to explain this avoid this movie at all costs you have only a certain number of hours on the earth don t waste of them on this retarded steaming heap of guano there is no story as apparently the director wrote and i m guessing with a blunt orange crayon the next day s script at the completion of the day s shooting the story has been called whimsical no it is aimless there is maybe enough story to fill a commercial don t you hate ads now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here and similarly the writer director can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work toy love so to recap even if you get this movie for free even if you re paid to watch it avoid it to paraphrase monty python s search for the holy grail run flee 
i just finished watching this film for me the most outstanding work in this film was the music score while many silent film scores work very well with their scenes i feel that this is the best score i ve come across the mutiny scenes in particular worked extremely well 
fans of gerry anderson s productions will recognise several actors and vehicles from ufo which was made after doppelg nger as well as sound effects from various anderson series barry gray s excellent music mostly unique to this film adds to the feeling of familiarity for these reasons alone i think any gerry anderson fan would find doppelg nger worth getting judged simply as a film it has to be said that doppelg nger is flawed it is known that there were major problems during production and i suspect this is why there is a time consuming plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story presumably time budget constraints prevented the relevance from emerging distractingly the special effects range from outstandingly good better than any s film that i know of to disappointingly bad nevertheless even with these flaws doppelg nger s main story is well told and keeps the viewer or at least this viewer engaged throughout the ending is perhaps not what one might expect from anderson yet at the same time it is typical of anderson and it is certainly appropriate to find out what i mean you ll have to watch it for yourself 
when a loser teen is bitten by an insect he becomes the superhero dragonfly superhero movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens sadly however despite the presence of david zucker who was involved with airplane top secret and the naked gun movies it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have mainly it s more dumb than fun the fault mainly lies with the gags it s simply not funny enough some of the jokes do work such as the nail gun scene but other parts simply fall flat the x men spoof for example or the whole farting sequence blazing saddles this isn t one of the key things about the best spoof movies like airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny the cast for the most part play is completely straight this makes it even funnier even when there is simple dialog in the foreground there may well be funny things happening behind the cast again funny the other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts to hang the gags on the recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies then try and spoof them as a result the so called plot of these movies very rarely exist another flaw these movies have is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene the cast try to get into the spirit required but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes it s hard to get worked up about it as recent spoof movies go it s not as bad as epic movie date movie or the awful meet the spartans but considering that some people involved here have made good funny movies in the past it s nowhere near good enough 
i was really disappointed by this movie great actors in it and potentially a great plot but it just seemed to limp along charlize theron was masterful in her role and beautiful but it seemed like of her on screen work was in car chases done with austin minis product placement gone wrong so very wrong the direction seemed off too edward norton is the bad guy and it was so obvious right from the start every time the camera would pass over him it would linger too long and norton would grimace or something c mon hollywood give us a little credit it s okay to surprise us with a plot twist without having to telegraph it sorry but this movie was just below average i have always been one to appreciate the work and talent that goes into a movie but this one just didn t have it 
i thought the movie was sub par the acting was good but not great the story was funny but did not come out that way the director dropped the ball on this movie it was not james jim or tea imho it was the music that killed it there is a scene where things go down hill and jonny cash music is playing man was that depressing not funny killed my mood after that the movie could not recover the deportation scene had potential funny situation good acting good set up i even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene the music kept me from being pulled in to the movie i say it had potential but was poorly done i would even say rushed into final production kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist the beginning the theater release was good i though so after watching it but the movie release exorcist dominion was a helluva lot better same story just different director same should be done here 
in the end credits of shadows after we read directed by john cassavetes some white letters on the screen can be seen the film you have just seen is improvised they say i am always pursuing the fact that words are so important in movies since filmmakers started using them because basically there s no film without a screenplay and many other reasons cassavetes pursued the same goal and he believed in the freedom of words shadows is the perfect example it s a film with no real main characters with no real main plot lines it s mostly people in different situations talking yes some of the situations are connected but cassavetes apparently always in a rush to get to the talking uses a fast forward technique when the characters are going somewhere or escaping from someone and are not speaking appearances are everything in this movie for example there s a brilliant score full of jazz influences and a lot of fantastic solos and there s one character that says he s a jazz musician and plays the trumpet ben all the characters names are the same names the actors however we never see him play the trumpet or jam with a band he doesn t even talk about music and just wanders with his friends around the city they do talk a lot and about anything that s in their minds going from how intelligent each of them are to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture shadows is funny in its intellectual references in parts like the one above because these friends are not cultured the only important female character in the film lelia though wants to be an intellectual but again she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party about a book she s trying to write and about how to confront reality but nothing to do with being intellectual at that same party a woman is actually making an intellectual statement full of complexity and asks a guy beside her do you agree yes he says but you can tell he doesn t know what she s talking about another character a singer hugh talks about his glory days in occasions and we see him perform only once but no references to the musical industry there the focus of cassavetes is the singer s relationship with his manager rupert which most of the time involves chats about trivial stuff and not real musical talks so the trumpet player s important deal in shadows is the time he spends with his friends the intellectual wannabe girl s is her way of handling romantic relationships one of the movie s strong points and the singer s is the bond with his manager appearances the reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation without mattering if they were actually good i believe some of them aren t but they surely know how to improvise in a scene and you can notice how well they do it shadows is not about performers it s about a way of making cinema based on the magic of conversation and there you could say that performances mean something that s why in every conversation the camera is like a stalker constantly on the eyes of every character constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech there s a scene where the trumpet player and his friends are trying to pick up some girls they are three so each of them sits beside one girl the girls are three two in three different tables they all talk at the same time and the camera shoots through the table and sometimes the friends look at each other while they say whatever they are saying it s natural 
corniness warning as many fellow imdb users already know i m not a corny cheesy person if you don t want to read this kind of review then go to tell you the truth you re hearing this from a man who laughed through titanic and almost broke his parents tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene spoilers one day i went off to the theatres with two friends to see dickie roberts former child star last year in august the boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly it was for radio the moment i saw the trailer i just had to see this movie on opening weekend when that weekend rolled along scary movie was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that friday night it turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie they went and also sold out good boy and radio i couldn t get a ticket and the following weeks i was busy with more important things about months later my friend rented radio he let me borrow it and i watched it in my room i ll tell you this now this is the only movie i have ever seen that got me crying ever when radio s mother died it just came out automatically the next day i went off to blockbuster and bought the dvd well enough of my stupid personal story let me tell you about the movie cuba gooding jr stars as a mentally challenged man nick named radio ed harris co stars and this movie is directed by mike tollin based on a true story radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone he goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around he s got his own collection at the end of every day he goes home to his mother he never went to school until later in the film one day radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing a football flies over the fence and radio picks it up and continues on ed harris plays mr jones the football coach they meet and this is the life of radio throughout the whole movie radio and coach jones spend quality time together both teaching each other things it is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys the lowest lows and just seeing radio live his life you will laugh cry and live the life of radio with him this movie holds a special place in my heart along with toy story and others this is a must see for the whole family by yourself or if you re someone who just wants a great drama radio is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen radio will never be forgotten by me never as ed harris character said greatly near the end of the movie we re not teaching radio radio is teaching us my rating eliason a 
i have never ever seen such a bad movie before the scene where they shoot some guy the pistol don`t even shoot damn that is baad the scene with the boy is even not that good no script not any good sound not anything good to say about this movie 
this show has to be my favorite out of all the s horror tv shows like tales from the darkside also from the same creators this show is a rare gem if you agree with me please sign this petition i started to get the word out for monsters and get it out on dvd here is the petition address www petitiononline com petition html some of my favorite episodes would have to be glim glim and rain dance i also loved the opening intro with the monster family that used to creep me out one of the things i would have to ask the dvd creators to include would be the organ sound heard right before where the commercial break would be i don t know if any of you remember that part but that s one of the main things that brings back memories to me i mean come on war of the worlds the tv series already has been released on dvd so i say monsters and also tales from the darkside and friday the th the series should be released too we the fans need to speak our minds we need this awesome show on dvd so please spread the word 
this movie was extremely disappointing i thought it would be another marijuana comedy but don t be mislead it s not at all there are barely any weed related jokes that come to mind i don t even think they smoke any weed in this movie the marijuana field is merely a plot device my impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of their idea of witty dialog and make a movie the product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting to say this movie has no hook is a huge understatement don t waste your time or money 
pure crap decent cinematography i liked some of colors other than that this was one of the worst movies i ever saw boring lifeless not once did i find myself interested in any of the characters i kept waiting for a real plot to form and the movie to pick up the pace nothing ever happened i think they spent too much time working on hair and wardrobe that they forgot there was a movie being made at the time 
young writers young auteur young cast busload of producers what could go wrong everything even lame is too good a description that suggests that three of four legs were functioning when actually none of them were barely enough recycled plotline for a and a half minute television hour gratingly stretched to ninety minutes the audience was talking back to the screen so bad was the story dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker how many thousands of times has this been done on television bad cops frame good cops again how many times there was not an original shred in this entire concoction giovanni ribisi made a valiant effort to prop up the lack of script drawing the only laughs of the entire movie and the thought of he and claire danes working from a real script with a grown up director and photographed by an actual cinematographer intrigues me note to screenwriters buy one of those story generators it can t possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television note to auteur there are shots available to you other than closeups even the lovely and interesting face of claire danes eventually grows tiresome in closeup note to cinematographer apprentice yourself to a professional for a few years you have much to learn note to color timer at the lab at least try to persuade the auteur and the cinematographer that they don t know what they re talking about note to claire i hope this paid for your new condo it s time to get some professional management and start actually reading the scripts before signing on 
this cheap and rubbish film is about a nasa test rocket that is sent into space with a cargo of animals it vanishes for a while then unexpectedly returns crash landing in a forest unleashing a vicious mutant creature like many films of this type night fright features dumb teenagers boogieing on down to s surf music before being killed none of the murders however are even remotely memorable as we don t really see anything one thing we do see however is that one of the teenagers appears to be about years old and sports a quite impressively silly haircut for a creature feature to work it really has to present its monster to the viewer properly in this film however we only get the briefest glimpses of the monster it seems to sort of resemble the alien from robot monster but i m not sure as the photography was so dark i simply couldn t make out what the hell was going on a lot of the time although my gut feeling was that i probably wasn t missing very much 
is this a bad movie of course what were you expecting from a movie called beach babes from beyond it is a babes in bikini movie and has no pretensions of being otherwise given this is not a room with a view or schindler s list if you wanted a film like a room with a view then you would not be looking at beach babes from beyond but if you are looking for a good babes in bikini movie with almost no plot this is the one for you this flick delivers on what it promises and then some it is pure adolescent fun there were lots of babes in and out of bikinis the movie was quite funny and great to watch these were some of the most beautiful women i have ever seen on home video every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this this is actually one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen so unashamedly i say again if you are going to watch only one babes in bikini movie this is it 
not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is paula sage s touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline this gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you ve seen something special 
this movie travels farther on gunshots kisses and clich s than should be possible yet it still works brilliant as i was driving home from the theater i tried to figure out how it got away with movie staples like the pages of a novel manuscript blowing across a beach or the impossible series of fortuitous coincidences without the entire audience standing up and screaming i ve seen that a million times before and you ve pushed beyond the edge of believability but the actors were so enchanting and the screen so filled with believable extras that i forgot to care a friend who saw it with me said it transported him to paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized we were still in indiana overall a romantic comedy thriller with subtlety wit and elan 
this this coming of age dramedy set in chicago in the early s we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives the two central characters are leroy preach jackson turman and his best friend richard cochise morris hilton jacobs both of these boys have promising futures preach is a great writer but a lazy student and cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball when they re not hanging out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends or hanging out at a friends house or chasing girls they re skipping school riding the trains through chicago or going to quarter parties on the weekends things go wrong when preach and cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car the police pursue them and they are arrested but thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher snl s garrett morris they are released but the two hoods are not and vow to get revenge on preach and cochise thinking they blamed the whole thing on them this movie is very episodic but it still works because thats what life is a series of episodes some funny some sad some romantic some bizarre the film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic and the situations are all believable and relatable like preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl or a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight or dealing with a bratty younger sibling but even when a situation isn t personally relatable like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to con a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie the sequence is still hilarious cooley high was the basis for the classic s sitcom what s happenin which aired on abc from even though the show is most famous for the character rerun he is not in this film nor is there any character remotely like him the humor of that show was very broad but still funny the humor of cooley high is truer to life and thus more entertaining additionally the soundtrack is wonderful classic songs from that period by diana ross the supremes the temptations martha the vandellas and smokey robinson play throughout the film adding to the fun youthful exuberant tone of the film 
this film is absolutely appalling and awful it s not low budget it s a no budget film that makes ed wood s movies look like art the acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything i have ever seen an ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants woddy strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit there is sadism as you would expect from an s italian video nasty no talent was used to make this film and the female love interest has a huge bhind italian taste maybe even for s italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but i guess it came out at a time when there weren t so many films available on video or viewers weren t really discerning this piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and it s not even funny just boring and extremely cheap it s actually and insult to the most stupid audience i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like this 
oh well its funny should have been a sadistic comedy a lot of horror movies lack common sense but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation don t really expect hitchcock or anything close to this this is a good one for friends but i wouldn t recommend it for anything else this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie the suspense the shock and good characters the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be and he seemed to be the average angry d student able to outsmart only stupid people and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so called victims just expect this one in the daily funnies 
this is an oft used line but it really sums up this movie if this is the current state of gay cinema then we re in real trouble i saw this film at siff because of the high imdb rating and if there was ever a case of vote stacking on imdb then this is it just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the film easy plot boy finds out his high school ex boyfriend is getting married to a female friend of theirs so he goes back to his old hometown still carrying a year old torch to see what happened first off i liked latter days the director s last feature despite its cookie cutter characters and plot contrivances but you re supposed to become a better director with each subsequent release i don t know how you get horrible supporting performances out of so many tv veterans robert foxworth joanna cassidy tori spelling but somehow he managed to the writing was lifetime network quality way back when they were really bad and the situations were unbelievable and uncomfortably hard to watch i kept reaching for a non existent remote control to fast forward but ultimately made myself stay to the end hoping for a decent ending ugh no even the gratuitous male nudity that popped up during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats to be fair the leads especially in the gratuitous nude scenes were gorgeous there was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling friendship as they uncovered how they went separate ways and the film looked great good quality and color saturation for an independent film how is it that network tv can give week after week of great entertaining weekly episodes like ugly betty desp housewives etc but so many feature releases in similar genres can be as bad as this 
a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on dante s inferno there is nothing especially clever dante s divine comedy was a brilliant piece of social commentary this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high art i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and or religious right and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked be that as it may few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire the high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of schoolhouse rock on the subject of lobbying and the revolving door it s really a shame that the entire film couldn t have been a musical that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun 
inspired casting charming and witty throughout much like the currency in the opening moments of the film the story floats along magically until you are emotionally invested in its outcome the city of buffalo has never looked better kudos to the burton sisters and the entire cast for a job well done 
it should be noted that this movie was not improvised as you re probably thinking of it despite what the title at the end suggests the movie was heavily scripted and rehearsed cassavetes didn t have enough money to support the inevitably high production costs of an improvisational sort of movie even if he had wanted to produce such a thing the improvisation of the movie is contained in the actors performances and the emotions that they draw out of the lines that said allow me to say that this is a stunning work that i m sure i ll come back to again and again the depths of emotion that cassavetes is able to draw out of the smallest gestures and interactions is incredible i have no idea how he was able to direct such amazing performances out of the actors especially under the conditions he worked this is truly a magnificent landmark of film that i would recommend to anyone interested in exploring beyond the hollywood mold 
george armstrong custer is known through history as an inept general who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of little big horn they died with their boots on paints a different picture of general custer in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure errol flynn plays george armstrong custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at west point custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble somehow this never appears to bother custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments in spite of his poor standing he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the united states army through an error custer receives a promotion in rank before this can be corrected he leads a union regiment into battle against the confederates his campaign is successful and custer becomes an unlikely national hero custer returns to his hometown marries his sweetheart libby who is played by olivia de havilland libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the seventh regiment of the cavalry custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the native americans to prove his intentions he enters into a treaty with crazy horse the leader of the sioux when that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the black hills custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers errol flynn dominates each scene in which he appears he successfully portrays custer as being flamboyant arrogant romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene olivia de havilland s depiction of libby bacon custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender more gentle side the chemistry between dehavilland and flynn who had acted together in several other movies is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of custer and his wife the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de havilland anthony quinn as crazy horse sidney greenstreet as general winfield scott arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining the reviewer would rate this a star movie while it is not historically accurate it is very entertaining the movie has a little bit of everything it has adventure comedy and romance so it appeals to a large variety of audiences the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land 
i m no director or writer or anything related to a movie but watching more than movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not so here it is the quick and the undead is a rip off of the quick and the dead i was thinking that it could be a little bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it but oh no i was really in for an very big disappointment to put it simply the movie sucks i m a big fan of gore movies but this one just gives you gore here and there but they are not that consistent but i have to give them credit in creating gruesome characters which has given me a little bit of squirm if you re a big fan of zombies watch this if you re not better look for other rob zombie films 
i am not quite sure i agree with the director of this version of the scarlet pimpernel i imagined sir percy blakeney a very calm seemingly lazy aristocrat this particular sir percy blakeney appears to be teeming with overwhelming energy and volatility i did not appreciate the houdini james bond mission impossible style escapes that sir percy engineered either in the previous versions wit was the tool for escape not technology neither were the characters of marguerite and chauvelin adequately portrayed there seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters i do not wish to assign any blame for perhaps the reason for my dislike of this movie might simply be a matter of difference in interpretation had the director s interpretation coincided with mine perhaps i might not have been irritated by what seemed to me bad character portrayals i much preferred the version from anthony andrews was quite efficient as the imperturbable calm fop so were jane seymour and ian mckellen in my opinion the style of this period piece seems to have been lost with this latest adaption i recommend sticking with the previous versions either the one from or the one from 
this movie is a gem an undiscovered gerry anderson classic the origins of both ufo and space are obvious from this movie including the cast list which includes the late ed bishop and george sewell who both went onto ufo it is unfortunate that anderson despite his many tv successes did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen just think what he could have done with the movie version of thunderbirds which he quite rightly disowned himself from i m sure if you give jttfsots doppleganger a fair chance you ll appreciate it s good qualities 
i don t really know why so many persons love this movie maybe it s funny ok but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written as the author himself said this movie has betrayed the book not only the story is violently cut to about but all the symbols all the complexity everything is lost in a very s fashioned fantasy adventure film for kids today we have effects directors a new attention to books i hope that someone tim burton peter jackson hayao miyazaki someday will direct the real neverending story a great dead writer a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it 
there are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making bronenosets potyomkin is one of these movies and it should be on anyone s list looking to learn more about the history of cinema grigori aleksandrov sergei m eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a russian battleship when the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors the locals embrace the them and support them things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business what follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema anyone who has seen the untouchables and bronenosets potyomkin knows exactly what i mean overall i think this movie raised the bar for film making just as intolerance did a few years earlier if you do not mind silent films do yourself a favor and see bronenosets potyomkin if you don t like silent films watch bronenosets potyomkin anyway 
i ve read the positive comments on this movie i assume people who were in this movie must ve come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why i watched this whole movie but i don t think i laughed even once during the duration of this film the jokes were mostly very bad but when the jokes had some promise the delivery was off if you liked it maybe you should lay off the buds because you need to preserve the or brain cells you have left this movie had a poor script bad acting poor directing weak plot nothing of virtue and was not entertaining if you haven t seen this movie don t 
i saw this movie over years ago and the subject still infuriates me as it should her anger and initiative were inspiring not that i would takeover an army and kill people but the scene at the well and at the rebel strong hold will never leave my mind this is a great film but be prepared for the strong subject matter 
i expected this movie to be absolutely god awful like what dreams may come or the truman show or something well they were selling it off for in my local hmv and it had giovanni ribisi on the cover you know you cant help but love him and so my friends dared me to buy it and i was sure it was going to be trash maybe thats the only reason i could sit through this movie because my standards were never that high 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made i ll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting post production editing directing or any other aspect of film making it s practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute quite literally ji woon kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels a seemingly insignificant object may be shown a rack of dresses two diaries a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack a bottle of pills etc but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene or perhaps the movie in total which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer s intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie but in a tale of two sisters such events occur in such a rapid fire relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness lest they miss something important in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this it s quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable the most commonly cited criticism of a tale of two sisters is nicely summarized by zaphod b goode who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions he posits that ji woon kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that in reality however nothing could be further from the truth a tale of two sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the exact occurrences of each and every scene of the film if our good friend zaphod had been paying attention he would have noticed for example the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film these flashbacks convincingly contradict zaphod s assertion of complete subjectivity the objective elements of a tale of two sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them can ji woon kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film i think not please note that i will not insult the intelligence of critics such as zaphod that cannot get a tale of two sisters because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence the movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle solving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture you need only put them together remember the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that when completed bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe don t misunderstand me there are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design spider forest perfect blue and donnie darko are perfect examples of this a tale of two sisters is not it s ironic that zaphod claims darko to be more masterfully constructed than a tale of two sisters especially considering that darko not only provides almost no objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina clich that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence i m ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence but the contrast is an important one although it does perplex me that zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort he apparently likes his intelligent films in the most superficial form possible this is evident when he makes consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself just read the threads by opiemar within the imdb a tale of two sisters discussion forum anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned obvious i d like to say more but i ve come to my word limit all that has been said here needed to be said so be it now said 
now before i tell you the synopsis this is a non spoiler review bone eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year i don t know how these movies even get onto dvd if i saw this in theaters i would get extremely upset bone eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find some bones it s the bone eater and the more bones he eats the more powerful he gets first of all i thought okay well the dvd artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy when i rented it and looked at the dvd label it looked scary but then when i played it in i could agree on one thing the title bone eater is better than the movie itself tell me what s more stupid a bone eater that just attacks by throwing a bone ate you and you disappear don t worry that s not a spoiler you see that happen in the first minutes or is it more stupid that bone eater has a horse you know what i think is the stupidest the whole movie the cgi is awful yeah i thought the idea of bone eater was creepy but once you see the actual thing you think this is some kind of action movie or just a cruel mean joke the film felt longer than titanic and this was half an hour once the film actually has its moments of suspense it just stops i admit the acting was not the best but actually decent and that the violence wasn t over the top but everything else is a stinker overall bone eater is a film you can skip if you like interesting movies with great creatures great cgi and suspense bone eater is a film to skip if you like bad movies no matter how cheesy they are then bone eater will satisfy 
i went into this movie with low expectations knowing uwe boll s legacy as a film director and screenplay writer and i was still disappointed uwe boll finds a way to make each and every movie he is involved in worse and worse the overall concept wasn t a bad one a man bored with his life as a stock broker becomes a serial killer but the problem with the movie is there is no in between he goes straight from stock broker to serial killer the film has no name actors and i can see why after watching the movie i can t see why any actor with a career would want to even be involved in this movie anyone who turned it down did their careers a favor and if you haven t seen it do yourself a favor and don t i give sanctimony a out of 
i must admit when i first began watching this film i had no clue what was going on so the beginning was a bit confusing for me however that did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie the characters reveal themselves to be more complex than they may first appear and that is what makes this a memorable film at first i heard this was a real hollywood movie although it obviously lacks the stereotypical guns and fists element the convincing performances of talented actors such as martin sheen and sam neill more than make up for it i d rather see a film with more substance than shooting any day 
witticisms colorful characters family relationships coping with hardships living with fun and humor this film has it all and more what a great every man and woman story with a top notch plot and script it offers just clean fun lots of laughter many smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family other reviewers describe the story some i ll just offer this comparison teaser it s part best of show grumpy old men millions and some other comedy and life flicks rolled into one this gem of a film most likely had limited release and is probably not very available to rent but it s now out on dvd and i highly recommend it for purchase if you like good old fashioned fun and entertaining films for the family you can t miss with manna from heaven this film is a sure fire cure for the blues or to chase the gloom away on nasty weather days or rough times 
absolutely nothing the movies that are great in this world are not recognized unless they are filled with gunshots explosions and death this movie is filled with a man talking about showing you a more complex character than has been seen in many movies when a movie is incredibly fast paced but stays mostly in one location it has to be the work of a genius surprisingly enough it is this movie is directed by oliver stone and therefore is one of the best directed films of our time this movie s screenplay was co written by oliver stone and eric bogosian barry champlain main character with oliver stone s help the screenplay was created as a seamless rolling script which keeps you interested the entire time if you have any amount of intelligence if you have an open mind about any subjects and the wit to comprehend others then this movie is something which you should find some way to watch immediately 
i actually flipped to lifetime channel by mistake just as this movie was beginning and ended up watching it it certainly deals with a serious issue probably more prevalent than we realize in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by an ego maniacal fellow student who feels he s above the system and unfortunately often is the cast here was believable and the performances credible a lot of these canadian lifetime flicks are decidedly over the top however this is one i might label as under the top while appreciating the fact that it wasn t presented in an overblown fashion this film somehow seemed like a record being played at a slower speed than proper the minutes seemed like many more and it had the effect of looking like a shorter film looped over and over seemingly going on and on and on and on before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion yet the engaging characters and performances made it better than the average film of this type despite these criticisms and while these pictures often milk the climax this one could have given it a bit more detail and length 
what can i say after i say the one line summary sandra does a credible job but what with the bad direction and story line it can t save it way too much pre occupation with guns how can the hollywood types rant about the need for gun control in our society and spend so much time and film footage focused on guns it s just worse than expected 
for a moment let s put aside the cultural aspects of this movie even if it is a very important side of it and let s look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two selfish husbands they have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope if each one of these two women had been alone imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept they found each other and they fell in love that this love was against all the social religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant they loved each other found relief in each other that was sufficient the reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept suffer even and then they can go on with their lives their life very nice 
fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick obsessives who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still to come greatness kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video he considered it embarrassing and amateurish and he was correct in his evaluation this is a weak and tedious film at minutes it still seems longer than barry lyndon it nevertheless is of historical interest and has its genuine absorbing moments it s a difficult film to find only unofficial copies are in circulation though perhaps this may change if kubrick s estate relents and has it released on video recommended only for kubrick enthusiasts 
this is a superb tv series it s sympathetic and for once realistic portrayal of lesbian women is delicately handled and well done on top of that the directing is wonderful and the settings sumptuous and rich a real treat if you missed the first one i advise you watch next weeks pm bbc 
my wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end i am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks but this movie is unbelievable if you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles this is the movie for you as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him spoiler plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real a must see for someone in the mental health profession 
 five characters in search of an exit has to be one of the most boring zones ever made it was on sci fi this morning and as usual i changed the channel i put it in my top five list of the worst zones ever produced dull and predictable and not worth watching serling worked this theme to death earthlings in the hands of aliens who often were giants and in this particular version it just doesn t work anyone who hasn t seen it before will quickly figure it out this is another serling philosophical mood piece perhaps paralleling the plight of those in prisoner of war or concentration camps where the imprisoned may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their captors william windom as the soldier who is the last to drop in is the only one curious to make the effort and it doesn t take long to figure the outcome 
dick and jane harper jim carrey t a leoni wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty i ve always been a fan of jim carrey it s been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy the last one was bruce almighty which was pretty good he has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element fun with dick and jane proves that he still has it even though the film was funny it was still kind of disappointing it wasn t as funny as i thought it would be it s worth watching once though unlike most of carrey s movies it doesn t have a good repeat value part of the problem is the script i was surprised the script was weak since this is the same guy that made the forty year old virgin some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard if jim carrey wasn t in it than the film would have been a lot worse next to jim carrey is t a leoni she s an okay actress but she just isn t very funny she doesn t match up well with carrey and she seemed to be phoning in her performance they should have gone with someone else the supporting cast includes alec baldwin richard jenkins and aaron michael jenkins the latter plays billy harper and he actually gives a decent performance he wasn t as annoying as most child stars are alec baldwin was okay and richard jenkins tried too hard to be funny to be honest i m a little bias here the film altogether was pretty average but i liked it more because of jim carrey s performance fans of jim carrey should enjoy it but that s about it in the end fun with dick and jane is a fun way to spend minutes but its not very memorable rating 
this movie has got to be the biggest disappointment i ve ever experienced with a film the acting is horrific the suspense build up minimal and the plot overall is ridiculous i found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps we re asked to make in logic and the so called suspenseful buildup would be lucky to get a year old to be mildly worried i m dismayed that a sequel is planned because it means they ll be asking us to once again swallow a sub par plot line if this is an example of raw feed s work i think i ll be avoiding any and all future films by them 
i don t really know where to start here just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from the acting to the props to the story that it makes you angry this is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and that is saying a lot because i have seen some bad ones when i saw this movie i knew it was a blade knock off but i thought that hey its got kung fu and vampires a combination that i thought could not fail that is until i popped this into my dvd player how ron hall managed to mess up something as cool as vampires and martial arts is beyond me first the acting i didn t expect to much here to begin with because its an action movie and a b one at that but the acting here is so bad i couldn t help but be bothered by it expressions and vocal tones were way out of place there was absolutely no emotion in almost the entire film and when there was it was so laughable it thought i was watching mad tv for example that girly man scream derek lets out when he has to kill master kao who should have never been born in the first place all in all i ve seen better acting at elementary school plays then there is the action not even sub par compared to the things that have been done in action cinema as of late but still the action was not a total let down as ron hall does seem to posses some martial arts skills but even the skill he does have is over shadowed by the stupid things he does for instance the part of the movie where he starts spinning and then the camera changes i almost ripped a pillow in half and the fight scene where his prison buddy fights off vampires by swinging his arms at them wow or how about the part in the jail where derek all of a sudden knows magic and can preform chants that make tap water holy water and as far as the props go the guns look like walmart toys the teeth were stolen from halloween costumes and words cant describe how bad the cg graphics are i could go on for hours about all the things wrong with this movie and trust me this is just the tip of the iceberg its only getting a because it made me laugh even though i was laughing at how badly the movie was done a laugh is a laugh i would say steer clear of vampire assassin unless you want to laugh at a horrible movie or are planning on getting tortured for long periods of time and want to practice
this would probably be a good film to see provided you ve already seen every other film in existence and thoroughly explored the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you god this movie was unbelievably insipid with some of the worst or is it nonexistent writing ever captured on film there is no saving grace to this film even the animatronics are kind of lame and it s just a complete waste of time and money run fast it s beyond horrible 
not a bad movie but could have been done without the full frontal nudity of a year old boy in one of the opening scenes this movie has excellent dialog which is certainly common among foreign films foreign actors still know how to act as opposed to american actors who let the cgi stunts and special effects do all the work for them this film is just good old fashion acting gerarde depardieux did an excellent job as always the costumes and scenery are accurate with the time my only complaint is that they should have dubbed the english words over the french instead of using subtitles this could just be because i hate reading subtitles 
it looks like people involved with this movie are stuffing the ballot box to boost its ratings the good news that apparently only people have seen it i suppose that makes me the th i have no involvement with the flick and don t know anyone who did and i m a long time imdb user check my vote record and reviews over the past seven years so i promise i m giving an honest and unbiased opinion it s coming to you from a year horror fan who has also appeared in a couple of low budget flicks himself aside from a couple of interesting video effects frankensteins bloody nightmare is incoherent boring and technically flawed beyond all reason it was apparently shot on silent stock and the audio then dubbed in most of it sounds like it was recorded with a tin can and a piece of string anyhow more than three quarters of the dialog is inaudible i watched this from beginning to end and have no idea of what the story was or even if there was one it seems like the director is mostly impressing himself with long panning shots of the corners of table and dead black spaces that do nothing but pad the film out that would be a problem if one were actually developing a plot and making a film that had some sense of pacing in this case though the rule doesn t apply it doesn t matter how scenes are shot because they don t add up to a story watching this video is an exercise in futility at every level whatever people who worked on it are writing and however they re trying to influence the ratings here on imdb this is just bad tedious stuff that s the honest truth if you re thinking of spending your money or time on this one think again it s easy to find something better because you won t find much worse and that s the unbiased unvarnished truth 
this movie is masterly directed by clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i think there is a sequel missing for this one barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions that is one i think was a real garbage but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films 
louis gossett jr returns to the well one more time as chappy sinclair who goes to doug masters played by jason cadieux who is in for jason gedrick who wisely declined to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste this is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry this one however doesn t have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable iron eagle iv is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation game played by two lobotomized teenagers it is horrendous to watch and gossett jr who has made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here and i saw cover up firewalker aces iron eagle iii toy soldiers and jaws d what is mysterious about louis gossett jr is that he seems to be like christopher walken in his quest to do anything as long as he s working as i look at his post oscar win some of his better movies include iron eagle the punisher and the principal considering that the latter two movies have him co starring with dolph lundgren and james belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work of course enemy mine and diggstown remain his best post oscar win work out of bad 
i heard what people were saying but i ignored them being rushed at blockbuster i grabbed copy of this movie and ran out minutes into i was fighting to stay awake there is some attempt to keep the film interesting but it was just bad a chase of some sort takes place but it was long and drawn out the perfect time to make a snack by the time this movie was over i didn t care how ended i just wanted it to end walking in and out of my room checking to see if it was over the entire movie is a cliche the characters and their relationships the plot twists are predictable as well as the ending the actors made the best out of really terrible roles all can say is their clothes were nice but the movie it was just bad 
 l appartement has to be among the best french films i have ever seen along with hatred also starring vincent cassel and those great gerard d pardieu pierre richard movies cassel and bellucci are amazing in the leading roles aside from brotherhood of the wolves and dobermann i have not yet seen a bad movie with this couple l appartement sucks you in from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you thrilled until the very end fragment storytelling really hasn t worked this well since pulp fiction let s just hope there won t be a godawful american remake of this unique romance mystery thriller edit guess what a godawful american remake has been made 
this is a phenomenal movie truly one of the best movies i have ever watched i am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me but this movie had all the right combinations for stirring the passion of the actors without the overacting the aching for all the characters involved the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce all make this a must see movie despite the fact that it is s this is definitely not an old movie but a classic vintage movie i hope you engage with it as i did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful but once they are made the pain will subside but only gradually this movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost lack of love the crafting of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone s heart and mind 
there s not much anyone can say about this flick the plot is quite simple two police officers who also happen to be lovers are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal with the help of the lady of the house played by hardcore pornstar chloe as anyone can guess there s a few plot twists and some blurred alliances but the writing was just horrible even for a softcore movie i ve read some previous posts about nicole hilbig s accent she plays the female cop yes it s hard to understand what she s saying at times but i think i ve placed it i did some sniffing around i think she s from germany hence her odd sounding accent she makes an impression even without speaking however she s got a great looking body there were a couple of from behind sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore film excellent work there the three way scene toward the end wasn t bad either spoiler alert i kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a part time call girl at the end she enjoyed her three way way too much end spoiler i m not gonna nitpick about the story too much seeing as this is a low budget direct to video softcore flick however it just seems like i ve seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storyline women b chloe and hilbig were okay as the eye candy sex b scenes were kinda short but good story c a recycled plot but whatever works eh overall b 
this interesting lost film written by terence malick stars stacy keach and frederic forrest as two wacky southern brothers on a quest to open a seafood restaurant margot kidder was never prettier and forrest should have been nominated originally titled the dion brothers this light hearted flick with a violent ending is a pure joy where is this film i ve been searching for it for years keach was still great back then and i m surprised it doesn t have more of a cult following maybe it does these guys are a crack up with more ambition than brains but totally lovable dudes a out of if you can dig it up somewhere you ll have fun 
this is the worst movie i have seen to date minutes of utterly bad acting half the cast seem to be suffering from asperger s syndrome ghastly wigs strange make up including tide lines around wig areas and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke one comical aspect of this film if you have the patience to watch it is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear were the cast paid in clothes for their efforts they certainly did not deserve paying with anything else this appalling effort of a film delivers a rambling plot in the first half blending into an equally confused arch christian biblefest in the latter the entire cast and production team should be burnt at the stake or at the very least crucified 
recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual but the entire family without resorting to preaching or hollywood sappy endings tony marchant s drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way highest praise goes david tennant and sarah parish for their incredible performances i had presumed before watching the drama that i would see some of their previous on screen relationship in blackpool bleed through but it never does neither actor is recognizable from any previous work and i didn t see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire minutes in addition harry treadaway s performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic throughout the piece he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house at times nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic as the viewer i wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality stop moping and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives but under the same circumstances i see myself acting like any of them switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything including behavior that is completely unlike myself it s the show s greatest strength truth without sugar coating to force us all to think what we d be able to do under the same circumstances this is a difficult but must watch show i hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the u s 
there is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around that years later it wont hold the same magic as it did before i must admit i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was pleasently suprised p tang yang kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a year old this film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess it is engrossing it is briliantly acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that john albasiny and abigail cruttenden s rolls in this film are st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now i urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me p tang yang kipperbang eehhh out of 
the battleship potemkin is now the oldest film i ve seen and it is also the first silent film i ve seen i heard a lot of good things about this movie so i got the tape out at home and i watched it when it ended i just thought that this was a classic masterpiece the story is based on the real life russian battleship potemkin you wouldn t think it but some of it was sad and disgusting sad being that the mother dies and the pram rolls down the stairway and disgusting being they have to eat rotten meat with maggots in it today it is still considered to be one of the best silent and russian films ever made i think that everyone should see it if they can find it you will be presently surprised at how good it is it s a must see classic 
yeah a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction now it s a prison again kind of well it s more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits so i guess in that way it s like a prison not really though when sasha steven seagal s character is being admitted into prison he s standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend like he s in line for the security check at the airport then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches smacking around a couple of security guards let me tell you something you assault a corrections officer in a federal prison they ll shoot you on the spot ja rule would have been shot about times before he threw his second punch oh and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot in prison federal prison you can t dress like that at most high schools in america speaking of ja rule i have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth including ja rule himself had to have been cent just before i watched this movie i saw one of those shows on tv about the greatest celebrity feuds ever and like number or was this rivalry between cent who had lived the thug life for real and ja rule who had not every time i saw ja rule on screen the only thing i could picture was cent laughing his ass off ja rule looks like a rowdy year old every time he appears on screen anyway getting back to the plot it s funny sasha is an fbi agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization he s sentenced to five years and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes nothing else in the movie matters after that it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences most of which aren t even well choreographed oh how about this a helicopter crashes through the roof of new alcatraz at one point accidentally freeing all of the inmates and what do they do they all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block without so much as a basket they had a ball but it doesn t matter the scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch so some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in alcatraz s state of the art execution chamber evidently not for stealing million dollars in gold but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught hey good thinking people if you can t get information out of someone kill them that s a great way to learn the truth so some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the million for themselves oh and the million is in gold bricks i doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency there s also the issue of the warden at the prison he s some tough talking vato who thinks he s a hardcore chollo from the barrio which reminds me of a joke i saw this comedian once talking about people in california who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense these people go to mexico the comedian says and they re like oh my god people live there that s like a total shack the best is when the united states supreme court justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can t carry their guns inside his prison i don t care if she is a united states supreme court justice this woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he s in charge ha and by the way the supreme court justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is that s a year younger than steven seagal i just thought that was funny the only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where ja rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little asian woman that was the funniest thing i ve seen in a movie in a long long time you know i work for the company that produced this film which i why i watched it and i still don t have a single positive thing to say about it except of course for that one scene with ja rule getting spanked by that asian woman so read my review of malena and you will see how strongly i sometimes disagree with professional film critics like roger ebert but in his review of this movie ebert wrote something that i agreed with as much as anything else he s ever written i imagine the flywheels at the mpaa congratulating each other on a good day s work as they rated half past dead pg after giving the anti gun movie bowling for columbine an r way to go guys 
even by the lowered standards of s slasher movies this one stinks the usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a forbidden part of forest which burned in the s and apparently left a sole angry survivor fast forward actually you ll want to fast forward through much of this mess to the present day where a couple of campers are butchered the teens follow in their wake while a semi concerned park ranger a sleepwalking jackie coogan and his healthier cohort who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run of the mill nature footage padding finally more killings but nothing you haven t seen a zillion times before if you want to see the kids butchered opt for sleepaway camp or the first friday the th over this
everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to the prey endless nature footage bad acting aside from these elements this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases is considered a cult classic jackson bostwick and jackie coogan play pretty well off each other there s also a three minute banjo solo that shows off bostwick s skill behind the instrument not too bad if i do say so myself the last ten minutes of the film are its saving grace the ending still haunts me to this day this can also sport a short lived plus in that an early john carl bucheler does the special effects some may know him from films like troll and friday the th part he directed both these films all in all this isn t a movie everyone will find something redeeming in in fact on a hollywood level this can rank right up there with one of the businesses most amateurish efforts but for that handful yet very loyal of slasher movie fans in the world even the bad acting and atrocious nature footage can be forgiven 
after a very scary crude opening which gives you that creepy chainsaw massacre feeling everything falls apart spoiler alert as soon as the two fbi officers start jabbing you know they are the real killers anyone who have seen enough of these fooled ya movies can figure this out this movie is mader with one thing in mind to depict brutal murders why then is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well will this be next for us movie goers the torture and abuse of children whats wrong with you people lynch is truly has a disgusting ugly mind 
i thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking but was i wrong this film was boring especially in the beginning and the middle parts i cannot comment on the ending because i just couldn t stand watching the whole film the premise of signing a student researcher just because he walks into your lab makes no sense this student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and sadly enough this non living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film so if you are having trouble with sleep then i recommend that you rent this film 
if you like really shocking movies this is for you the acting is the worst i ve ever seen and the story line goes no where if you come across this film in your video shop don t even consider borrowing it the chick on the front cover isn t even the one in the movie i gave this movie only because i couldn t vote avoid it at all costs 
okay now i know where all those boring cop homicide tv shows came from i do believe they can be traced back to this movie scene of the crime feels more like a tv episode or an episode of a serial complete with stock characters and situations the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors the aging cop who doesn t want a desk job despite failing eyesight the reckless rookie the double crossing dame etc i like many of the actors here and they do a good job but overall i found this movie dull as i m not a fan of the genre i kept tuning out when they were discussing the case something about bookies and informers and oh yeah there was a stripper played by the previously wholesome gloria dehaven what i want to know is why did she keep calling van johnson uncle wiggly wasn t uncle wiggly a rabbit a character from a children s book what the heck does that have to do with anything i guess i just don t get tough guy film noir ish kinda jargon in fact much of the dialogue made me mutter nobody talks like that however i could relate to one scene where the cop s wife arlene dahl who worries every time he goes to work realizes that maybe she shouldn t have made her husband the center of her life yeah i know that feeling of loving someone so much being so dependent on them that there s a constant fear for their safety so there are moments of truth in this film underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self consciously to be gritty and real that it actually seems unreal to me a little background this movie was made when dore schary took over mgm from louis b mayer and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made mgm so great dore schary was determined to bring more realism to movies i kinda hate dore schary maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious bleak movies being made today wallowing in the ugly truths about life focusing on and in my opinion helping to perpetuate the worst of humanity rather than the best no longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do providing a necessary distraction during the great depression and world war ii well damn it we still need that kind of distraction today there s still plenty of depression and plenty of war and what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape trashy brain deadening reality tv thanks a lot dore 
i m not really sure where to begin from start to finish bad stinky bad like stepping into a port a john on a degree day if you force yourself to watch this as i did keep some vicodin handy for the pain i will never understand how flicks this bad make it past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor the movie is a cross between gumby rides pokey meets the terminator meets wally beaver playing cowboys and indians without the cowboys i ve seen better animation in the original cut of the blob you will get more entertainment from watching gone with the wind while suffering from the puke and poops bad acting and hokey lines will have you squirming and wishing you had rented peewee s big top or watched every episode of gilligan s island back to back ugh i m going to go slit my wrist now 
this is the kind of film one initially selects to make up the numbers from video rental only to discover an under rated entertaining and enjoyable movie the opening sequence of the police arriving at a dark and rainy house wherein the wife has committed murder or is it and the remainder of the film seeks to unravel what really happened ok the film is a bit campy but has good editing and dialogue professional acting often humorous and the very last scene with the facial expression is one of the best of its kind definitely worth watching deserving at least a or an 
there are a lot of bad films out there tune in to channel every night of the week and you might just be treated to a daily shocking effort from one filmmaker or another there are possibly films that have caused me more pain were harder to sit through than this but in terms of writing acting direction cinematography and the bare basics of cinema inbetweeners is a truly truly appalling effort and should be avoided at all costs the only laugh it gave me was in the behind the scenes documentary on the dvd in which the film s geeky director darren fisher explains how it was his script that attracted the talent to the project never underestimate the power of self delusion darren fisher britain s answer to edward d wood jr 
i think not i mean yeah if you compare this film to the godfather or maybe a little older film like casablanca or maybe even a little newer film like the english patient it doesn t have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films but that doesn t mean that this is a bad movie or does it i think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great oscar winning films you should never do that which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie in the categories best picture best actor in a leading role and best actress in a supporting role this film really deserved all of them the magnificent dustin hoffman gives us once again one of his best performances a couple of times in this movie i forgot that it wasn t his son because it was just so real i have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful so dustin hoffman passes the test with flying colors in my opinion there are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best katherine hepburn meryl streep jane fonda and ingrid bergman i can t help it i think she s great meryl streep even though she s in a supporting role is amazing and real and you just can t help but being drawn ed to her talent and the way she makes it hers and real wow that s all i can say justin henry was great considering his age his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful so i say good job to cute little justin henry while i was watching this film for like the third time alone i couldn t stop crying i tried but i couldn t thank god i was alone this is probably the purest film i have ever seen other films that were nominated for best picture was apocalypse now norma rae breaking away and all that jazz i m ashamed cause i haven t seen any of them but from what i ve heard apocalypse now is great but when i heard about norma rae i only thought of sally field i think that considering the other nominees this film deserved it s five oscars and that it ll continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future just like it has for the past years good job all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us great performances and memories from watching this film that we won t ever forget thanks for your time 
it was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch the economy with which it has been edited and the films structure itself are the main elements that contribute to this the film really captures the spirit of the revolution that it is dealing with you really sympathise with the sailors and citizens of course this film has it s own agenda but as it is a practically redundant cause it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sense the tension created on the screen is excellent starting with the battleship itself and then moving onto the mainland things escalate believably and for a film of it s era it really is quite unflinching in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film this really is worth sitting through that is if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for mins 
fox is pretty lame they cancel the wrong shows it s bizarre that they would cancel a well written program like arrested development and yet they keep this show and war at home i feel that fox loved that they broke barriers with the then edgy married with children but now it s just getting ridiculous the loop is a pointless and boring watch and their edgy jokes just fall flat in order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming family guy and the simpons work because there is a constant flow of jokes fox needs to pull their heads out of their rectal cavities and quit letting their relatives write this mediocre tripe i mean if you re going to invest money into making something entertaining make it entertaining also stop using no named actors it s great to have up and comers but you need to anchor a show with a noted celebrity duh fox 
this movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `oh i want to learn more about custer s life and his last stand do not rent `they died with their boots on but if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film with a little bit of romance and just for a good story this is a fun movie to watch the story starts out with custer s errol flynn first day at west point everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles including his battle in the civil war the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn in between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with libby olivia de havilland errol flynn portrays the arrogant but suave george armstrong custer well olivia de havilland plays the cute sweet libby very well especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance the acting in general was impressive especially the comedic role although stereotypical of callie played by hattie mcdaniel her character will definitely make you laugh the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era the script at times was corny although the movie was still enjoyable to watch the director s portrayal of custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable some will watch this movie and see custer as a hero others will watch this movie and learn hate him i give it a thumbs up for this western film 
this is truly without exaggerating one of the worst slasher movies ever made i know it came out in the s following a tendency started by friday the th the prey copies the fore mentioned movie in many aspects the woods setting the killer the dumb teens the gore etc but the prey is as bad as you might expect i didn t even remember about it if it wasn t for coincidence well the killer is in fact human so don t expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason the situations rather boring and lack of tension gore violence etc it just does not works for a slasher flick the acting is simply horrid the score is horrible a combination of boring instruments with cheesy s tunes i won t even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me it seems that it cost only dollars please avoid this one like the plague it s one of the worst movies i ve ever seen and that s something to say thank god it seems to have vanished from earth 
i have seen a lot of movies in fact i love b horror movies they are one of my favorite genres however this garbage i refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of film was the worst piece of crap i have ever had the torture of watching i actually signed up on imdb purely for the fact that i needed a way to at least voice how awful this garbage was i have watched films they at least deserve the honor done in basements by high school students that were better written and directed i have nothing but pity for the poor actors in this garbage because they were just trying to earn a pay check they will now and forever have this stain on their records like a virgin who was raped and given herpes if writer director john shiban has any dignity left at all after obviously fellating countless people to get this made he should never allow himself near a camera again and try applying his so called gifts to something more suited for him like mopping the floor of a peep show 
i first saw the movie a couple of years ago and was totally and utterly impressed but its sensuality it is one of the most touching films i have ever seen though it might appear a little bit pretentious and artificial too much beautiful if you will anyway one thing is for sure the camera man has done a great job each picture deserves to be cut off the film and displayed as a separate peace of art comparable to the chirico s or bernard buffet s paintings the music forms a perfect background for the story especially u s one played between the first and the second novels at the beach scene as for the casting i cannot be objective since i like sophie marceau and jean renaue very much and cannot add more to the praising comments of others however the very fact that many people critics and those sophisticated in cinema criticized the movie made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time no doubt the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous but this is somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and cohesive film the second novel when sophie marceau tells her story to malcovic is somehow superficial and does not tell much about the motivations of the people involved was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked marceau or what apparently it does not add anything to the idea of the movie and even the husky voice of malcovic is being unable to link it to the main plot other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot which indulges many of the logic fallacies within them the scene when jean reneau is overlooking the city through the huge window of his apartment on the top of the high building is absolutely incredible the feeling of moist air and fine haze which is being spread by the first ferrera scene can literally be sensed through the screen no doubt antonioni is a great master of shades and semi shades my favorite novel is the last one the most romantic deep and meaningful i guess that it the most antonioni like one in the whole movie almost a parable probably the overall positive impression from the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small ghotic italian town with its winding narrow streets and crooked pavements fountains with the l eau potable and monumental cathedrals it was laconic but really touching i hope that my impressions and comments on the movie however chaotic they are would motivate somebody to spend an evening watching it it works better with the home theater having somebody caring by your side than in the movie theater enjoy i beg your pardon for the imperfect english and any possible misspellings
 a true geek girl s dream high tech high drama smart guys steamy sex and large explosions very large explosions sam waterston is so natural in the role of oppenheimer that tapes of the real oppenheimer sound odd apparently he had a voice similar to ronald reagan the triumph and tragedy of oppenheimer is one of the th century s most stirring dramas and this movie stands as a model of what docu drama ought to be the facts are allowed to speak for themselves while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record not to call attention to themselves an interesting fact some of the technical details used had only recently been declassified and so are of special interest a must see 
i hate to say it but i really do think this one s overrated and i love jackie s films it s got more plot behind it than usual but unfortunately though it has some great stuff i find it to be a bit slow all in all i say it s entertaining but not great 
made it through the first half an hour and deserved a medal for getting that far lots of excuses for scantily clad women but no real plot to speak of emerged in that time what sounded like a good idea for a movie was badly executed 
i have to hold my hand up and say that i was one of the first and probably the last to see this film where do i start it s a complete mess the main attraction of course was the soundtrack which goes without saying is brilliant it s what himesh does best but as they say don t give up your day job hr definitely shouldn t hr s acting is plain and simply awful even if the film had a plot the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there two words of advice to hr give up acting and secondly use chapstick hr has no screen presence no acting skills and the female lead looks just a little too young for him as for malika sherawat just the same old bollywood vamp crap you can package the product as much as you want but if there s no substance it won t hold don t waste your money 
for three quarters of an hour the story gradually develops towards a pivotal point of some sort although it is overburdened with scenes that just seem to be intended to dull the viewer and lure him away from the actual plot there is something happening it is not much and it certainly is not obvious the combination of palace impressions and story driving scenes do not add any depth or insight to the whole cast of characters in fact they keep them sterile as there is no character development at all everybody just remains spinning and centered around their own clich and role the cute kinda headstrong girl the fighting berwoman the snobby aristocrat the male lead does not seem to have any distinction at all he is a shallow presence which actually doesn t even matter as he is only there because the storyboard required him to it seemed like he was on vacation and got caught up when the point comes of turning the corner in terms of what happening the movie first snaps completely blank for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous it solves or better dissolves itself with a by the book deus ex machina more clich s and some of the most crude plot devices and choices i have ever seen it s history alright first the movie s a drama though it s supposed to be comedic and then it turns into a farce the protagonists do what they are expected to do and there are no surprises the first set of somewhat serious antagonists however gets replaced by a couple that literally was just bored maybe that was some kind of nod towards the audience this movie does not get any bonus from me for underlying philosophical meaning since there is none nor for its technical realization the animation and editing is fair and so s the sound mixing but it is by no means outstanding or even above the average japanese productions of the late s in fact the visual treats seem static un inspired and un original worst of all it totally fails to entertain even if you don t bother with characters and all that stuff there s too little going on here and the rest is corny at best get a real ghibli instead have a feast with it and keep your fingers off this one 
in my personal opinion i think this is the greatest video game ever created i first played this game at my friends house years ago the very next day i went out and got my own since that day close to seven years ago i have not stopped playing it i can t help it i just can t get bored of it i ve been addicted to other games on other much newer systems but i keep coming back for more goldeneye every mission is amazingly fun and challenging the multi player mode was like none other i hope you can be as fortunate as i was to have played four player multi player mode because i had brothers and friends who would get together and play this game all the time 
detective sergent vince de carlo james luisi and company are on the case of a vicious serial killer rapist can psychologist carol susan sullivan help or will she become the killer s next victim and what is with the killer s hilarious white dude afro inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy killer s delight aka the dark ride is a rather dull serial killer tale from that doesn t offer much if anything it s more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie as much of the violence occurs off camera sure we get mutilated bodies but we don t get a whole lot in the exploitation department especially considering that they are from the aftermath and not during the crime those hoping for the likes of the toolbox murders or maniac will be very disappointed fortunately there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that get s the tone right and is quite suspenseful to boot also john karlen is quite effective as the killer though his hilarious hairstyle white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle is more than a bit distracting the dark ride is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation as it lacks the proper exploitation elements and is dated even by the standards of the time those looking for a better example should probably turn to don t go in the house and a few others instead as this just doesn t cut it

the bridge at remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay i ve ever seen aside from the acting which is wooden no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows up the middle of roads and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready the constant suicidal behavior set off my tilt switch so often i found it impossible to enjoy the movie apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had this movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in saving private ryan unless you are under years old i recommend watching something else gb
i checked this out for free at the library and i still feel ripped off yes sandra bullock is actually in it but only in five scenes totaling up to barely minutes and even those are fairly painful to watch the rest of the movie is so bad that you ll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon but only if you re one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it everyone else will just turn it off don t worry you aren t going to miss anything bullock s lines assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is plastered on the case are essentially just parroting of other characters lines like this dialog lisa bullock danny please tell me what is going on danny i don t know lisa whaddaya mean you don t know danny i don t know it s something to do with my dad lisa whaddaya mean your dad danny i don t know he ed up or something lisa why am i here danny i m sorry lisa i don t know moments later danny some army buddies of my dad lisa whaddaya mean army buddies see what i mean bottom line just say no 
the screen writers for this mini series should have been sentenced to the guillotine themselves they butchered a very fun story and squandered the talents of richard e grant the only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name all of the characters were totally altered and the story was not the same i strongly suggest watching another version of the scarlet pimpernel any other version is better than this one 
brass pictures movies is not a fitting word for them really are somewhat brassy their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class tv commercials but unfortunately brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours in this they fail miserably their undeniable but rather soft and flabby than steamy erotic qualities non withstanding senso is a remake of a film by luchino visconti with the same title and alida valli and farley granger in the lead the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around venice during the italian wars of independence brass moved the action from the th into the th century to be exact so there are mussolini murals men in black shirts german uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans but it is just window dressing the historic context is completely negligible anna galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral ss guy who always puts on too much lipstick she is an attractive versatile well trained italian actress and clearly above the material her wide range of facial expressions signalling boredom loathing delight fear hate and ecstasy are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars she endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity i wish some really good parts come along for her she really deserves it 
i was so looking forward to watching the documentary self immolation of the mastermind behind boondock saints one of the most aggravating and pointless movies i ve ever seen but the makers of overnight buddies ex of the mastermind in question also need to learn how to make a movie various unsavoury remarks yelling obscenities into the phone and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make mr duffy look like a putz but it doesn t shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place what his creative process or vision is what s boondock saints even about how hard is it to meet patrick swayze what are these strange institutional machinations in which our disgusting heroes are caught because the film doesn t try to answer these questions in any coherent way it doesn t end up having dippity doo to say about hollywood either so who cares 
this show is made for persons with iq lower than the jokes in the show are so lame if you are on a deserted island and you do not have anything to do you will be better than to watch this garbage you will hate their accent their behavior and all the stupid jokes and pranks they try to perform it really pisses me of that viewers gave reba on their voting sure i knew there are some people with iq lower than but what i did not know that there are so many of them so people if you got to read this i hope that you will never ever download or buy this peace of garbage i know it is not the place for his but i wish to recommend one much better mini series scrubs 
 while sporadically engrossing including a few effectively tender moments and humorous the sledgehammer obvious satire homecoming hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling with material like this timing is everything michael moore knew to release fahrenheit before the elections and the real tragedy of dante s film is that it didn t come out years ago when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further in mockery of the well settled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling or imperiled as it did then frankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence and if you didn t notice michael moore didn t exactly help to defeat bush there was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was painful to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect as they say with friends like these who needs enemies 
noroi follows a documentary filmmaker masafumi kobayashi as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that s leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake after interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby s cries coming from the house next door where there is no baby kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor he s greeted with hostility by the unhinged disheveled woman maria takagi who answers the door and promptly slams it in his face and gets a peek at her year old son through a window strangely both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch and the woman who first complained about the noises as well as her daughter are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that this piques kobayashi s interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what s going on he soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic well known year old clairvoyant and tv celebrity kana rio kanno seems to think we may all be doomed but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help another female psychic actress marika matsumoto becomes involved as does mr nori a mentally unstable kook psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to ectoplasmic worms clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that s now covered by a lake and the legend of an ancient demon known as kagutaba unlike many other hand held horror flicks this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first person scares thankfully there s something of a storyline here a very interesting and intricate one at that so it doesn t rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera work every once in awhile to keep your interest the way masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth with well placed jolts along the way reminded me somewhat of the omen in its pacing the film also doesn t entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we re watching is an already completed documentary that helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style the performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the actual footage either overall it s a well made horror film with lots of plot shifts some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments that s well worth checking out my only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long otherwise pretty good stuff 
this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see it started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches then they made a movie out of it the leads are not pros and you can see that but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away norway is known for making crappy movies no offense but i had a good feeling about this one even thou i m not interested in football i wanted see it the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them if you re ever gonna see a norwegian movie let it be this one 
by the time the hellraiser franchise was reaching it s forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin dr paul merchant bruce ramsey is a scientist in the future whom while prisoner regales his captor of the story of how his ancestors all played by ramsey had first built the evil lament configuration puzzle box that sets evil upon the world and how his bloodline had subsequent dealing with said box the film is a awash with lack of continuity in regards to the other films and lack of coherency in this one yes this could be due to a combination of rewrites massive cuts in the original version of the film or what have you but i m reviewing the film as is and not what it was or could have been and as it is now it s a mess sure the franchise will go on indefinitely with direct to dvd sequels but this one was pretty much a death nail to it s chances of getting a new one released theatrically ever again my grade d 
one should not be too critical about the director s second feature i really like the camera work of madiba as mr shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at things however howcome a year old boy shoot such beautiful images remember he has not got any education of any sort i don t think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos worse still madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of any way if you overcome above mentioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work 
i was actually satisfied when i played this game the graphics were something new the missions were great but yet i felt i wanted more out of this game for a james bond game its pretty good but not as good as his other games it would be great if they could make a remake for it it would be much better then this may just be cuz i m into games as resident evil dead rising and those kind of games so it could be better but it was ok to play one thing i absolutely hated about this game was natalya she was irritating dying all the time and she couldn t run either i recommend this game for those who like fps games more than i do stars
as main character lillith silver likes to point out you know f k all about vampires it is evident that this statement was aimed at the cast and crew who create an exceedingly bad image of everyone s favourite bloodsucking undead according to the misguided director vampires are all caked in white foundation and crammed into latex similar to a piece of meat in shrink wrap with fangs resembling bannana s and a bad case of asthma our main character lillith creates a slapstick caricature of the modern day vampire the plot consists of a year old boys playstation collection jotted down on a piece of paper then blended together to concoct this horrible tale lillith our pale protagonist is a vampire bounty hunter who makes a living from snubbing out members of everyone s favourite cult the illuminati rather than incorporate the classic assassin methodology of stealth and precision however lillith waltzes in through an open window and then proceeds to chomp her targets necks before shooting them point blank with a handgun that apparently doesn t leave bullet holes thanks to the shoddy continuity pc plod is then assigned to solve the murders he comes to the grizzly yet strikingly obvious conclusion that lillith is actually a vampire and proceeds to hunt her down armed with the usual vampire dispatching tools including a cross garlic and a sharpened piece of wood meanwhile lillith who has gotten into the habit of bonking her boss is distraught when an old nemesis kidknaps him and demands a ransom to be delivered personally as you may imagine this doesn t go according to plan i m not going to put myself through the pain of the following scenes however so i ll skip to the end lillith and her nemesis have a showdown and after lillith obtains victory it is then revealed with all the extravagance of someone being told they have cancer that the two are century old lovers and the whole plot was some kind of twisted game yes that kick in the balls was the actual ending of the film in my eyes this joke of a conclusion is the icing on the latex clad cake and seals this film in the never ever watch this vault as far as cinematic techniques go the film merely doesn t bother creating any style the director tries to rescue his disasterpiece from the brink by throwing in some close ups and a few multi angular shots this however is not the saving grace the film needed you may be screaming but this is a b movie its meant to be crap i however do not take pity i have seen some cracking b movies such as evil dead and jesus christ vampire hunter and therefore this disgrace cannot hide behind excuses the budget was low this is obvious by the lack of location and good actors maybe however if the director was more creative and spent less money on paying for makeup and fake blood he could have done something decent with this sickening attempt the seedy sex scenes are not beneficial in any way and merely served to give me a few chuckles at the obscene acting skills throughout half the budget must have been paid to the female cast merely for getting their tops off for lesbian romps if i wanted to watch a vampire porno i would have bought muffy the vampire layer the cast are bad the story is worse and the effects are cripplingly fake this film had some potential however its seedy undertone and embarrassing portrayal of a classic horror character merely served to be its downfall if you want a laugh with a few friends i recommend you watch this mockery if you are looking for a more serious vampire action flick try blade or underworld to sooth your raging bloodlust 
if you came here it s because you ve already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it i feel for you i really do and i profusely apologize as a canadian because that s what we do that this film ever had to cross your eyes if only for a moment i hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases i like everyone else rented this movie believing it to be some stupid b movie ripoff of blade i thought sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie i ll give the creators of this film one positive comment about their creation thanks for removing the rec xx xx xx from the bottom right hand corner of the screen i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie and for the record i saw the movie but did not watch it the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother s trailer i swear to god you know what i m not writing anymore about this it s just too painful 
the movie touches the soul of the audience very much some scene in the movie is ultimate and tears comes out automatically i m surprised by seeing this movie that any director can direct this type of movie in the year as a student of cinema i can say this movie helps a lot to understand use of montage first time when our teacher told us about this movie means genre of this movie we thought nothing could be there in this movie to understand but finally when sir explained it then we came to know how great this movie is lastly i can say it helps a lot understanding films and being a cinema student i can the viewers that they can see this movie 
i am not understanding why people are praising this movie i didn t like it at all i watch it with several people none of them cared for it either first of all it is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story the actual filming looks like a live tv interview the makeup is bad when you watch the movie along with the dvd extras you will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it there is no talent there are facts that do appear in the book the facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and skits added to it i have read several books and have watched several shows on this story what i have always caught from all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story i really wish someone could really do a good film on this one it has always fascinated me the bad acting really ruined the story the little boys situation really hammed it up even more when you watch this movie the little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh about it didn t make any sense why his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him it was like the witch was supposed to be so threatening but it was ok to throw baby brother to her it is a whopping tale with him and his little problem i can t still get over the little girl saying mom said tobacco will rot your teeth frank fox s statement and facial expression is so bad the scene out in the yard with him getting food is pretty stupid to the sound from parts of it seems to be from the movie psycho also the girl hovering over the bed and her little bladder control problem are from the exorcist this movie is lacking from the talent of creativity we put the movie in for a couple of minutes and knew right away it was a bummer i also noticed that their was defects in the film quality parts of it looked like what a person might film on a home video camera i noticed a lot of the people in the credits had many multiple jobs this is probably how this movie was put together someone said i like this story i will get all my friends and make a movie about with a video camera and a computer doesn t matter if we don t know how to act as long as we get it on film and say it is good we got the family together and prepared food then sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie 
one comment said it wasn t a comedy mistake it was a delightful comedy of a period of history that doesn t lend itself easily to that genre very busy and active film from beginning to end often the shots out the window of the train or car were just beautiful an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours in a theater all the french historical figures like charles de gaulle and petain and the some of the people involved in the french resistance were included in the script which might send those who are unfamiliar with the collapse of france under the german invasion might want to research the characters were engaging and the actors portraying them were excellent recommend it out of 
years ago when darling lili played on tv it was always the pan and scan version which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all boy what a terrible film it s so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now it s obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn t sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesn t work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing mind you the version on the dvd is the director s cut or in this case let s salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut scenes from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are minutes into it and we still don t know what s going on or why we re watching what s going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someone s death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things aren t helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings there s no catalyst in this story one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music it s no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment i ll give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julie s mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending bird s eye view of julie running towards hudson s plane is another wink at sound of music the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence i m like what happened here the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where s peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudson s squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant what s also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that s one slow moving train there the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film stars but it s effect is diminished considerably because it s repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no man s land is ok even if it s bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn t make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like she s on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie she s no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as cloying and cute how bad is darling lili even after years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release 
eisenstien s potempkin bronenosets potyomkin is among the finest films ever made and possibly the best of the silent era eisenstien was a pioneer of film form and his use of montage editing has influenced films to this day the odessa steps massacre footage is as powerful today as it was when first seen over years ago do not pass up the chance to see this film 
walt was particularly fond of quality so how come the producers at disney would release such a terribly edited roughly acted even for family fare mess of a movie the big green had a good concept and since it is disney you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously but the big green is horrible the jokes are lame and steve guttenburg still alive pulls in another terrible performance on his resume kids with too much time on their hands in small town elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer the kids don t know a thing though and gracious for us we get to see steve guttenburg try to hit on the teacher from beginning to end the speed up camera work does not work the big green is full of speeding the pace of characters to move the movie along kids are not idiots they will catch on if you give them enough of a hint without showing all that garbage guttenburg for once in his life should have turned down an offer to join this movie also the pretty olivia d abo should have called this one off too the big green can be known as the big bomb 
produced by nott entertainment this movie is nott very good at all i sat through the first minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad the casting is bad and camera work is bad as i hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet it is nott even worth the bandwidth up until the time i wrote this review the average vote for this movie was an which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of s for it obviously voted on by liars and shills this movie is nott for everyone or parents if you want to punish your kids with this awful film have them sit through this one for halloween 
i do not know what today s movie goers expect but after years of movie watching well maybe i didn t watch many movies in the first years so make that years of movie watching i expect to be entertained not bored to tears assaulted by continuous profanity every other word and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood splattering and body parts being mangled surveillance is one of those movies that was made by people who have no imagination little if any talent a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on long after the purpose for it has elapsed that anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie when it is nothing more that hollywood garbage is beyond me as a combat veteran i have seen violence blood and gore in many forms and movies like we were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get but it has redeeming value surveillance must have been dreamed up by persons in a drug induced stupor with no writing ability no directorial training no experience in film editing and a total lack of contact with reality just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as fbi agents setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops etc a high priced piece of garbage that only an idiot could like 
not even the beatles could write songs everyone liked and although walter hill is no mop top he s second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies the nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film the emergence of the rapper turned movie star was in full swing the acting took a back seat to each man s overpowering regional accent and transparent acting this was one of the many ice t movies i saw as a kid and loved only to watch them later and cringe bill paxton and william sadler are firemen with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold implications i hand it to walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location but i fault everyone involved for turning out lame o performances ice t and cube must have been red hot at this time and while i ve enjoyed both their careers as rappers in my opinion they fell flat in this movie it s about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief now this is a movie its not a documentary so i wont waste my time recounting all the stupid plot twists in this movie but there were many and they led nowhere i got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was sord of confused and just playing things off the cuff there are two things i still enjoy about it one involves a scene with a needle and the other is sadler s huge pistol bottom line this movie is like domino s pizza yeah ill eat it if i m hungry and i don t feel like cooking but i m well aware it tastes like crap stars meh 
lame rip off of the quatermass xperiment the first half is deadly dull even dreary but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging monster in the accompanying featurette a rather dry affair at a mere minutes when compared to the ones created for the other titles in criterion s monsters madmen set director day who admits to not being a fan of the sci fi genre tries to justify the film s shortcomings by saying that he had a zero budget to work with where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage and i d have been inclined to be more lenient with the film had i not recently watched caltiki the immortal monster a similar and similarly threadbare but far more stylish venture from italy bill edwards as the cocky but unlucky astronaut obsessed with achieving the titular feat is positively boring at first but he eventually manages to garner audience sympathy when his physical features are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood marshall thompson as his commanding officer and elder brother is o k as a leaner glenn ford type he had previously starred in fiend without a face another and more successful richard gordon produced sci fi which incidentally is also available on dvd through criterion italian starlet marla landi struggling with the english language makes for an inadequate female lead even her input in the featurette proves to be of little lasting value the audio commentary is yet another enjoyable tom weaver richard gordon track where among many things the fact that first man into space was intended as a double feature with corridors of blood is brought up but it was eventually put out as a standalone release so as to exploit the topical news value of the current space race it s also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by bonar colleano who tragically died in a traffic accident prior to the film s release weaver even recalls a couple of anecdotes from the time when he was involved in the production of the dvd featurette shot by of all people ex cult ish film maker norman j warren landi who by then had become a lady of title was still ready to help out in carrying the equipment necessary to film the interview down several flights of stairs edwards was supposed to have contributed to the featurette but once in london he proved reluctant to co operate with weaver eventually the latter learned that the actor had been recently diagnosed with cancer and in fact he died in 
similar story line done many times before and this was no improvement minutes into this and you should pretty much be able to turn it off the ending was deja vu all over again the only morals i could see out of this are stupidity criminals do not equal success if he screwed you before he s gonna do it again
the movie which was directed by alfred hitchcock was brilliantly made it starts with a family of three a doctor james stewart his wife doris day who is a former stage singer and their young son my guess is about years old who are traveling through morroco for leisure on the bus the bump into a french government agent and they are a little too nice to him he is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought he wants to carry this information out to someone so he goes to the only person he even slightly knows james stewart the antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him his son would be killed stewart has to travel to london because that is where his son is and where the assasination that the agent told him about would be the movie is very suspenseful there are many twists and turns typical hitchcock movie also it has just the right amount of comic relief in addition to all of that it won an oscar for doris day s performance of que sara sara this movie is very good it is hard to find a problem about it i would certainly reccomend it to all hitchcock fans and all suspense fans i give this movie an a only because it is a little bit predictable 
like an earlier commentor i saw it in and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story splendid acting and dramatic musical score it certainly contains some of sam waterston s finest work he and the writers depict oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero which he was but also as naive fond of alcohol and snobbish a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype 
i m doing a thesis on blurring the boundaries the female cross dresser and am using tipping the velvet the book as my main text any comments on gender and sexual identity gender and sexual confusion gender as a performance gender as a fiction gender imagery cross dressing as an erotic fantasy and as revolution the effect of the male costume etc etc would be much appreciated but a bit off the point has anyone seen sergio toledo s film vera its about a young lesbian possibly transsexual cross dresser i m dying to see it because i think it d be really helpful does anyone know where i might get a copy of it i ve tried amazon and a few other sites but no luck 
i saw this one remastered on dvd it had a big picture of sandra on it and said starring sandra and made it seem like she had a big part in it not so she s barely in it she does what she can with the script but that s not much the sound was awful by that i mean things didn t go together shots would be fired and the number of shots didn t correspond to the sound people talking in a car while it s moving and the shot is from outside the windshield but there s no motor noise road noise or any other sound kind of weird score was awful it sounded like the same few notes over and over dialog really awful acting was awful i couldn t believe any of it fight scenes were like a batman comic without the biff and bam they were really lame the shooting scenes i mean with firearms were laughable literally i fast forwarded through a lot of this movie even then it was too long 
can t liberals like alec baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of and the ridiculous lame swipes at walmart non union workers george w bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional gwb accent that balwin s character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen as the credits roll the sour grapes continue as special thanks are given to ken lay and other ceos from enron tyco worldcom and imclone let me clue you in to something if you put all your money into one company s stock you re an idiot we don t need this excuse for a movie to tell us that what a waste of jim carrey s talent from the trailer i expected a completely different movie what i got was a minute dnc commercial on how to scare people into not investing for their own future keep them stupid and keep them dependent on government no wonder hollywood is in trouble and can t make a decent movie anymore maybe you guys could get an original idea and put it on screen for once although i shouldn t be surprised since jane fonda was cast in the original 
i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill maher wasn t involved with this movie an american leftist laundry list of axes to grind with a distinct sparseness of democrats in hell mao zedong and karl marx didn t make an appearance in hell but ronald reagan is in the same room with hitler perhaps we ll have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures cheap shots at religion right wing politicians corporations and their lobbyists fox news even suvs all the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the other side of the aisle to not have been a conscious effort the singular exception i noticed in the hour and a half is jfk has to have sex with marilyn monroe for eternity the token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing non partisan 
i have noticed that people have asked if anyone has this show i have all episodes that aired in the u s and will be willing to share these with anyone interested all i require is that you supply the vhs tapes or blank dvd s i have them on both formats and pay for shipping my email is creator pipinternet net just send me an email and your request and i will notify you and we can make the arrangements the quality is very good and they are very enjoyable to watch especially if you have not been able to see them since they aired in the s it was one of my favorite shows as a child and hold a very special place in my heart because it brings back a lot of memories of my childhood as well as other shows like ultraman and astroboy peter
a really realistic sensible movie by ramgopal verma no stupidity like songs as in other hindi movies class acting by nana patekar much similarities to real encounters 
this is probably the best cinematic depiction of life in a manhattan ad agency the pressure to perform client and agency demands the parties the creativity the money the cool surface with powerful corporate undercurrents toss in parenthood for dustin hoffman the movie is textured and deep it follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what s going on his relationship with meryl streep and her friend who becomes his friend and his the relationship with his son while meryl streep was great did she set the record for least screen time to win an oscar she sure can deliver when she is on though 
ok when i say wow i mean jesus please help me i have an old vhs copy that was printed before troma got a copy of the title the movie is about an alien crash landing on earth to terrorize us with a gun that blasts people into oblivion watch out and by that i mean watch out for those special effects there is an amazing number of mistakes the acting is terrible but i d say the only one putting forth any effort would be the sheriff the film itself is really grainy and poorly lighted in one particular scene it is day outside and then the shot shows the night beast shooting his gun with night behind him then it shows day again shakes head i usually like low budget horror films but i had to force myself to finish it because i never watch a movie without finishing it the only accomplishment this film achieved was an alien that wasn t stereotypical so for that and only for that i give it a out of don t watch this movie if you ve had a bad day you ll be even more depressed at the failed attempt this movie makes 
from the dire special effects onwards i was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film lets put it this way i have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film i thought i can do better than that whilst sat watching this pap the acting in this film was terrible i suppose the best actor was the guy from lawnmower man but the french guy from aliens was so wooden i wondered how he got the former job in the first place the storyline was mediocre and i suppose like most films if the rest had been done well it would have stood up i don t usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating must be cast crew i felt i had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack 
part of the movie s low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure while this is good for drama in comedy we know the pains it need not be emphasized as a result fun with dick and jane is not an appropriate title and i was just plain disappointed failing to see any fun with dick and jane it is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name but it fails on the execution and the title was not appropriate for the story line however if the movie was retitled to be the art of the steal and the emphasis on bungling slapstick comedy more takes on the robbery and the plans to steal stupidly of course would have given the movie a major boost while at the same time the movie should show the ceo at least in the beginning to be a crook so it will be easier to project the pains to someone responsible early on and just leave it at that the movie suffers a viewpoint issue and with that in mind a comedy cannot work if the viewpoint is not done properly a scheming husband character who is that of a wile e coyote on the road runner would be more funny including the slapstick comedy but in this case a steal instead of the capture of the bird with complicate contraptions would be extremely funny here i mean you can make many of these and put them in the movie but since the viewpoint was done wrongly the robbery part had to be limited you will enjoy the movie the first minutes during jim carrey s great rise but to make the problems they had to faced to be more comical since it is a comedy that is the part that needs a major overhaul it can be funnier if problems were faced more like john travolta s civil action during the downfall that movie was a serious one but the problems they faced were somewhat comical 
almost certainly the best three stooges short with shemp brideless groom is as good as any of the trio s best shorts featuring curly memorable stooge moments abound the opening with professor shemp giving voice lessons to homely untalented and lascivious miss dinkelmeyer dee green wincing at her horrendous singing notes and fighting off her advances is an excellent example of shemp howard at his best many considered him the most naturally funny of the stooges later when moe and larry try to help him get spiffed up to find a wife and claim shemp thinks he has cut off his head when his mirror gets flipped backward fixing the mirror he cries with relief there i am and pretty as a picture yea moe quickly replies trying to hem his slacks of an ape the best scene and maybe shemp s best with the trio comes when he pays a call on attractive young miss hopkins christine mcintyre mistaking him for long lost cousin basil she smothers him with hugs and kisses also leading to a hilarious bit between moe and larry in the hall not giving him a chance to explain his true identity suddenly the real cousin basil calls and she goes berserk slapping him repeatedly and accusing him of taking advantage of a poor helpless defenseless woman that final line is delivered as she socks him in the jaw with a real punch according to shemp and crew members knocking him through the door and into the hall in a perfectly executed gag what happened kid moe asks can i help it if i ain t cousin basil shemp asks before passing out other classic bits include moe and shemp getting tangled in a phone booth trying to find a lost coin larry getting slapped because of shemp s bad looks his face pressed against the phone booth glass and the great girl fight in the justice of the peace s apartment the great emil sitka delivers his classic line inscribed on his tombstone hold hands you love birds over and over as his apartment is trashed i prescribe brideless groom as medicine for anyone who thinks the stooges glory years ended when curly left true shemp didn t have as many great shorts with the group as curly but that was due to an increasing lack of support from columbia and his and the others advancing ages when shemp was healthy and the trio was given decent material to work with they were still on the top of their game 
ben affleck about to be married is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers sandra bullock forcing herself to act insane who is to blame for this inept ugly morass it is so badly edited when i looked in the credits it wasn t to read the editor s name it was to see if the person actually took the credit rife with clich s contrivances and sandra bullock in raccoon eye makeup the movie doesn t even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters laughs are non existent the scene in the gay bar with affleck might have gotten a big laugh if it weren t so stupid the bar patrons a big rowdy bunch of them shout for affleck to strip and start digging out their cash it s not supposed to have any significance other than getting ben to loosen up a little but the direction of the whole scene is wrong headed and the outcome is unseen because the idiot editor cuts away or was that all the film he had it s a small moment but it s typical of this film an amateurish piece of pop goods that wants to be an edgy modern comedy but doesn t have any guts it is tailor made for the bottom shelf at your video store from 
a really awful movie about a meters long shark bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a confusing ending a complete a waist of time in my point of view i thought it was a tv movie but then i saw it was not i cant imagine having paid to see this load of crap please avoid this movie at any cost even if u liked jaws which i averagely did don t see it even if you have interests in paleontology don t see it even if you like corny movies with corny actors corny plots during corny tv time do humanity a favor and do not i repeat do not pollute your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a sci fi animal thriller still some people gave it a ten ranting don t know if they were serious or not but sincerely expect they weren t 
spoiler wolfcreek meets texas chainsaw massacre if you ve seen those don t waste your time with this one typical slasher movie nothing new here except for the spoiler visions which just add fluff to an already weak plot i would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and it s either see this movie or stare at a bare wall for hrs the only semi interesting part spoiler is when the chick starts drinking in the empty sheriff s office i say it s interesting because at least she made good use of that liquor instead of stereotypically using it to start a fire to kill the bad guy although she did go that route towards the end all in all lame bad and not worth effort 
everyone knows that late night movies aren t oscar contenders fine i mean i ll admit that i was a bit tipsy and bored and figured i d get to some skin a max it s pretty bad when the info on the tv guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description it even gave it half a star to be fair i did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was soooooooooo bad i couldn t stop laughing i mean the words coming out of these people mouth and how they were trying to be serious most of the time i think the people on the screen were trying their hardest to not to laugh in fact i think in one scene they did laugh anyways the movie didn t make sense it was like that one sopranos episode with the fat gay guy only the sopranos is great show but it was terrible i mean no nudity just sex scenes out of the s you know the kind that use shadows and silhouettes instead of flesh i gave it a two cause this flick makes for a good drinking game movie i mean with all the cheese it helps to get the wine out if its late at night and all that is on tv is this and that tony little guy and his exercise bike then i suggest tony little 
this movie is soo bad that i ve wasted way to much time already talking about it soo bad really bad and i m not even that critical i m almost ashamed to admit to having seen it sandra s few minutes show you how far she s really made it i mean really anything next to this is really oscar worthy for her i suppose the only way for her to look at it is there s no way but up after this one i suppose she had to start somewhere but really soo bad awful really bad is too good a word for this s t but i don t want to get mean now but really how can u not after wasting minutes minutes of my life that i ll never get back minutes i could have spent doing something better like sitting on my butt and staring into space that would have been time better spent walks away shaking head 
i have seen this movie just once and i m looking forward to see it again and again dear david from beligium why did you bother to write a comment on this movie i only think we can think about you after reading you comment is that you re provably a non sexual person like erika in the movie and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up i guess you are a bit old and sexual expression is not part of your visage the cannes film festival is by far the best movie festival and i m is my pleasure to say that this film was awarded with best actress best actor and grand prix isabelle huppert is magnificent as always who would do this movie like her one of her best performances ever the music is fantastic and once more michael haneke puts reality in the big screen it s like a dogma kind of movie because of the topic try to see it 
this is a gripping story that borrows elements from the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western tale the movie has a good music score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much giuliano gemma and the rest of the cast are superb this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action and it succeeds because the story is excellent this is not to say that there is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right away and keeps you absorbed til the end you ll always be wondering what s in those documents everyone s after it also has some biting commentary on american politics this movie shows why valerii in my opinion is in a three way tie with sollima and corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors 
quite simply goldeneye is the single greatest n game to date the learning curve is just about perfect and you ll still be playing it with your friends months on as the multiplayer mode is nothing short of exceptional the system for acquiring cheats for once requires some degree of skill rather than simply knowing which buttons to press and the challenge of aztec on agent level is astonishing all in all it s the best game i ve ever played on the n 
for the most part i considered this movie unworthy of a comment but the last minutes prompted me to write one you see right then we learn spoilers if they can be called that that the devil s emissary has no chance of properly preparing the domination of the world by his master because he is not skilled at martial arts prosatanos has been lying in a hole for centuries waiting for human greed to release him only to be defeated in a simple one on one match against year old former karate champion chuck norris imagine what would have happened to him if he had taken on jackie chan 
publicity for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational well we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses so we are not shocked by the duke of mantua urinating during his reprise of la donna mobile nor is it sensational to see gilda sing caro nome in the bath it is just crass and boring what stands out about this film is its lack of imagination director corina van eijk sets the duke s palace in a seedy swimming pool in fact he is not the duke he is just a character named duka so it s difficult to see why he has lots of hangers on and his own jester rigoletto rigoletto lives in a council flat that is furnished with the orange sofa and decorated in the spotted wallpaper that is de rigeur among avant garde directors the duke s sorry duka s heavies ride around on motor scooters yawn concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected and unintentional humour what can we make of the fact that gilda has a maid even though she lives in a council flat when the call goes out that monterone is being taken to prison we see him being marched out of the swimming pool by two attendants in pink shorts one imagines that he is going to be charged with urinating in a public swimming pool it was common for opera films to be lip synced years ago but there is just no excuse for it today a dubbed opera is like soft porn you don t believe in what is happening because the performers are not making enough effort the actress in gilda s role does not seem to have learned her lines properly she barely moves her lips when she is supposed to be singing when she sings caro nome in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly parted it is difficult to tell which orifice the sound is supposed to be emanating from the duke later caps this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with maddalena giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon the ambiance of the sound never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as though it is being played through a transistor radio fairly slow rumpity tumpity tempi are preferred so that the overall effect is of a karaoke in your local pub this is a film of a production by opera spanga spanga is a village in friesland in the netherlands they normally perform in a tent in a field if i had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in friesland i would have been fairly indulgent by filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience the villagers also hold themselves open to worldwide ridicule 
as i said sometimes low budget is good you get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra bs that can hide an otherwise piece of crap well this was that piece of crap if anything i thought it had humor unfortunately the humor was unintentional the only half witted acting came from bill smith and his part was cut out that s a joke there was never a bill smith nor was there anyone cast who could act even gerald okamura sucked and he s been cast in nearly movies the fight scenes were comical and made me feel like i could kick all their the sound was horrible as if all sound was recorded on the set my year old could have written a better script btw my year old fell asleep no kidding i give a b to editing for cutting the movie to only minutes minutes would have been an a 
whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in himesh s head which is always hidden under a cap covering almost half of his face all the time only hope this is first and the last as well for god s sake from assalam valekum to gayatri mantra himesh has tried every thing to create an aura of his so called singing talent which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like tanhaiyya which completely kill the beauty of the terms so commonly used for love songs why does himesh not smile simple because he does not use close up toothpaste now there this friend of his tailing him around every where and this number one lawyer in the town who has to herself sexily wiggle and try to seduce himesh of all the handsome german people she might have met earlier perhaps the male lawyers on this part of the world might be cursing their fate for destined to deal with the stiff unattractive lot every day the action scenes are so funnily shot like the event planner attacked by the thief autos riding over the cars so on and so forth the father of the bride seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her off that he flies to and fro around most hypocrite he praises hr for distributing love among people of the world as if they were sweets and on his back coolly gives a lecture to his daughter on these show business men when himesh is proved innocent he again unceremoniously dumps the other guy as if it s a game of musical chair i didn t get to se the poor guy s face even did you hansika in the role of ria looks as if she is in need of an eye check up for strain in her eyes the fellow in the role of a friend is good who has acted quite naturally and should be in better movies like sharman joshi for example child artist in trishu s brief appearance is sweet but wasted it seems today s young generation has gone nuts since they prefer this kind of mockery of lyrics and musical scores and associate gossip with it for example if you sing ek bar aaja the ghost would come this is a weird taste in music and rather funny i am surprised how such classic lyricists like gulzar have opted for himesh of all the people to give music there is story in panchtantra that a crow attach s so many feathers of a peacock to look beautiful and appeal to the birds but the feathers fall off ultimately and the real dark crow is revealed hope himesh takes a hint and refrains from manufacturing such meaningless stuff and wasting precious money which he has earned by taxing his short nose so much his friend does tell him if your nose is cut how will you sing thanks for showing us germany himesh at a reasonable cost of renting the dvd and correct those spelling mistakes will you an extra e in movie and no e in love there is also a famous number from the old film sholey mehbooba on which mallika sherawat wiggles once again but this time with himesh winking at her and conveniently ria his so called real love and his new bride is not around now that was very clever himesh at least one thing in this movie which you have done smartly to justify sherawat s presence but doesn t she look a bit washed down 
this is a movie you ll either love or hate i loved it if you are looking for suspense great special effects action sophistication cynicism etc you won t find it in this movie it is a feel good movie sentimental positive uplifting the heroes of the movie are coach jones played by ed harris a man of strength and integrity and radio cuba gooding jr a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world i guess i didn t find this movie to be sentimental hogwash as so many did because it felt very real to me i know people like these i ve seen jocks who think it s fun to pick on the vulnerable i ve seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable i ve seen people who think high school football is serious business i ve seen people who know what really is important in life any of these people could have been people i knew i did laugh i did cry i left the movie feeling good remembering that there are people like coach jones and radio in my world if there aren t people like them in yours you might not like the movie if you don t like a movie that shows the better side of human nature you ll hate it 
i would not recommend it whatsoever it was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater so i couldn t leave and watching a part porn movie except they didn t take their clothes off it was the body language and definitely the language i have to say i was embarrassed filming was very low budget no good dialogue yuck actors stunk except the two best characters who got killed off and they were david carradine and dennis hopper it did smack of kill bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers you know what i mean blablabla the filming was grainy and just a very low quality there was nobody in that theater that liked this movie and the people around me were younger and tattooed 
pure schlock from beginning to end the average year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination otherwise it s a pure camp fest endurance test like one of those so so episodes of star trek the next generation that thinks it has something important to say you ll see every plot twist a mile off in this by the numbers romp however it s worth seeing for its portrayal of drag king prostitutes a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them how s that for role reversal and lesbian soap operas the ghost of valerie solanis lives 
this movie is in the list of worst movies i have ever seen with lessons for an assassin on the spot the acting is lousy sorry sandra bullock but even your performance was horrible the music score could have come from a bad x rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous it had this in common with a typical action movie the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one syllable words but contrary to the average action movie there was no real action in this one boring the only reason i continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie thumbs down on this one 
firstly i am a huge fan of crap films b grade is always good for a laugh unfortunately this film is just plain bad i dressed up as a zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film especially the big guy at the beginning it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with crayons the acting is so bad i need not comment on why the effect are also extremely amateurish with obvious blood tubes firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot it also seems many people commenting on this movie are trying to boost the rating nobody without their finger in the pie would rate this film above a frankly it is disgraceful that people who worked on this film are boosting their own ratings i suggest everyone avoid this movie it isn t worth wasting the minutes of your life absolutely awful 
this is probably the worst film i have ever seen it makes plan from outer space look wonderful the acting is wooden the plot silly and the sfx non existent the only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long film the scenery is sometimes quite pretty assuming you like trees if that helps any 
one reasons why they call the s the awesome s is quality television shows like the wonder years war of the worlds the series v amazing stories and many more have always left an impression to each fortunate one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself to top that here comes monsters a series quite unique of its own and a theme fully dedicate to monsters may it be the good the bad and the morbid if you re a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you provided you can find this rare gem even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness it s indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity i guarantee because i m be sure not to miss this although it s a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world it will always be with those who can always remember 
the entire civilized world by now knows that this is where emil sitka says his immortal hold hands you lovebirds but shemp howard professor of music steals the show watch him tutoring dee green as she fractures the voices of spring watch shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string watch him as he gets walloped by christine mcintyre watch him and you will laugh and learn moe is no slouch either watch him as he attempts to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap larry as usual is the zen master of reaction all in all one of the very best stooge shorts you won t find one weak moment 
i wasn t able to last ten minutes on the this terrible film in and age of dv cameras it looks to have been shot on vhs without aid of any color correction or microphone as a filmmaker myself i know the constraints of indy film making and even keeping those things in mind i m amazed films can be made this poorly the only praise i can offer is that this film got distribution as i ve seen considerably better films still seeking modest domestic or international release i m guessing the box is what sold it it does have good box art but it all goes downhill from there side note it seems the director has friends since no one on the this planet would give this film a 
millions in gold is traveling by train to the us treasury traveling along is lois lane to report on it along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves they detach the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones this leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves the thieves overpower them but then lois lane jumps in she beats the thieves off the train at one point using a gun but the train starts to careen out of control lois can t stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold good thing superman is on the way fast exciting non stop action probably one of the best of all the cartoons just great 
cinema at its best is entertainment if one is to question every aspect with which one finds room for disagreement and much of recorded history is based on contemporary opinions often biased then one should leave the cinema because their prejudices will always spoil their enjoyment when i spotted an airplane flying overhead in a film dated bc i was amused the background scenery in casablanca is absurdly fake so do i set up a moan say that the film failed to convince fiona relax and enjoy some excellent acting wajda s decision to cast the protagonists as french polish was inspired one was immediately aware of which side each of the main characters was representing no need to dwell on the authenticity of the wigs this is powerful cinema if there is a political message which is still relevant today have a dinner party a ch teau d yquem with the foie gras a puligny montrachet with the entree some polish vodka sorbets and perhaps a ch teau lafite rothschild with the beef and discuss the political aspects of danton until you drop with fatigue danton would surely have agreed 
i was unfamiliar with this film until i saw it included in a list of the top spaghetti westerns i recently came across following the marathon i made these last few weeks of films from the subgenre it was auspicious then that the film had to turn up almost immediately on late night italian tv for the first time i m pretty sure in a good number of years unfortunately the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast hasn t been great lately i recorded the film on vhs but i decided not to keep it due to this factor as it happened the very next day i watched the film i found out that it was available on a region dvd from italy featuring an interview with uncredited scriptwriter ernesto gastaldi and having been sufficiently impressed i decided to order it there and then even if i knew that i wouldn t be getting to the dvd for quite a while as i like to allow some time between one viewing of a film and the next a brief parenthesis here when i recently purchased a spate of spaghetti westerns on italian dvd i opted not to order sergio sollima s face to face since i was under the impression that it was a bare bones affair however i ve just learned that the disc actually contains an interview with the director as had been the case with the big gundown [ ] which i bought it did seem baffling to me that sollima wouldn t offer similar contribution to that film s dvd edition when he actually considered face to face as his favorite work as per the director s talent bio included on the blue underground region disc of yet another sollima spaghetti western run man run [ ] the trouble is that i loved the big gundown so much that i followed it with a viewing of face to face via the recording i owned made off italian tv i did order the dvd of that film now especially since it s still discounted but as i said with respect to a second look at the price of power although i may still check out sollima s interview when the disc arrives o k rant over the film under review is quite an unusual spaghetti western and a very interesting indeed ambitious one at that being a transposition of the jfk assassination case to an old west setting actually it s reminiscent of anthony mann s terse black and white thriller the tall target which dealt with an assassination attempt on the life of then u s president abraham lincoln it features one of the most popular italian stars from this subgenre giuliano gemma in what is perhaps his most impressive western role many of his other films tended to have a light hearted bent the supporting cast includes at least two other notables van johnson in one of his few and mainly unremarkable italian films as the american president killed in post civil war dallas and fernando rey as the head of a conspiracy of southerners who not only plots his assassination but also conveniently maneuvers the new acting u s leader johnson s vice president by means of blackmail benito stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who pursues gemma all through the picture and with whom he s engaged a couple of times in a duel in the dark with the guns resting on the floor rather than in their respective holsters and the only light in the room provided by the end of the cowboys cigars also involved is ray saunders as gemma s black sidekick whom the narrative eventually turns into the doomed lee harvey oswald figure stelvio massi who later cut his teeth as director on a number of poliziotteschi is behind the film s luminous cinematography similarly luis enrique bacalov supplies yet another great euro cult score which is different enough from the style of ennio morricone as to be equally distinguishable valerii s direction here may mot be as imposing as that in other spaghetti westerns but he handles the proceedings efficiently enough the final gunfight is especially nicely done the film is certainly one of the more underrated entries in the subgenre and for those so inclined the novelty of the plot line alone should make it one to look out for 
this movie was incredible i did not know the back story on it so i needed to let it unfold before me on dvd it had many twists and turns but still kept the story fresh and exciting the acting by elaine cassidy was in a word brilliant as well as sally hawkins the storyline is rich with plausible occurrences as well as fresh ideas from the present there is truly something about ms cassidy s eyes that leaves a mark this movie is a refreshing look on the way in which we look at the victorian times and how we view that society a very worthwhile watch 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed but not quite that bad i really lost it with those out of the blue not so special effect guys if you re an insomniac go with your girl to see this movie i give it three sleepies 
a three stooges short this one featuring shemp of all those involving shemp i ve seen this is my favorite performance by him in a stooges short the basic plot is that shemp must get married by o clock that very evening if he s to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will so shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected that is until they learn of his inheritance money best bits here involve shemp shaving shemp and moe in a telephone booth and larry on piano as accompaniment to shemp s voice training session also the sequence where shemp is mistaken as cousin basil and its outcome proves hilarious 
i saw this series on pbs in in college and i still can t get it out of my head although i have never seen it since i remember every cast member the casting was perfect as mentioned in other comments the design the lighting and of course the story which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set probably the best tv series i ever saw next to the original roots 
the marriage of an upscale new york city couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out it took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door a neighbor tells us the busy distracted husband takes on the motherly responsibilities and grows closer to his son but soon the wife returns highly manipulative picture doesn t give us a very realistic familial unit with young justin henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between dustin hoffman and meryl streep but the dynamics are intriguing and involving and director robert benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness marvelous classical music canny editing and surefire bits of humor streep s character is designed to be a cold self centered witch but i was ready to feel a lot more for her than benton probably wanted it all has to be painted in terms of black and white good and bad with hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent the film never falters from its preconceived path and very fine acting nearly saves it but i m not sure where benton was steering the film in the final act and the closing scene is awfully abrupt from 
how did so many talented or at least charismatic actors wind up in this baloney nothing is very good about this movie but the worst things probably are the screenplay and the directing apparently this is director damian niemans heart piece as he s both written and directed it and acted in as well he s a card magician himself and seems to have named characters in homage of other famous magicians this was his first feature film as far as i know and chances are it s his last it s hard to point to exactly what makes it so poor but i d say the story and character s are not believable the screenplay and the directing doesn t give it any boost the director plus the poker scenes are bad in the worst hollywood manner super hands hollywood rules the supposed twists in the movie are either totally predictable or totally unbelievable they just end up tying a knot to a story that at best can be described as a few decent scenes 
although this was a low budget film and clearly last minute it holds a certain charm that is difficult to pinpoint i tend to believe it is the scriptwriter grant morris see dead dog who despite the warped plot line injected a fantastic slice of humour sorely missing in many of today s box office hits definitely a must see for a sunday afternoon laughfest speaking as a true single girl and very sceptical this film did not inspire me particularly but did ignite a small flame of hope for a lovelife not my lovelife so much as my slightly crazy neighbour s lovelife who lets her hamster sleep in her bed with her she may find someone 
i hope the people who made this movies read these comments the choreography was horrid the plot was nill and the actors where so low budget power rangers appears star to this junk the fight scenes where so slow you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next move camera cut aways and poor lighting could not cover up the cheap effects the lightning was just plain stupid the weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game and the dual bow and arrow was just dull as anything i have ever seen next movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics better script and try actually spending some time on your stunts honestly there are shows on t v that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one stick to martial arts unless its as poor as your acting then take up quilting 
my first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for but since it featured sandra bullock who i generally like i bought it my disappointment with the film began almost immediately the dialogues are slow and stiff the color is distorted i kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations the acting is amateurish even the killing scenes are a failure twice dead people moved their legs when my cash deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie i immediately and joyfully complied this is an amazingly bad movie tomorrow i am giving this dvd away at the company white elephant christmas party 
christian propaganda lots of fear mongering this is not scifi this is chrifi christian fiction the movie started out ok but took a sharp christian right turn from then on it was all about god jc the holy bible and the devil the ufo s are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe satan s idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible the abductions could be used to explain away the rapture the people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction instead of god taking all the christians to heaven no reason to repent if its aliens the deeper message in the movie is that if you don t believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose 
aunt cora had always been tactless and her well bred family ignored the remark she made after her brother richard s funeral he was murdered wasn t he they remembered it the next day when cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchet for some reason the poirot movies this year have been far from faithful to the original book i was disappointed about the changes made in cards on the table my favourite poirot book after the funeral is my nd favourite poirot book and i was scared the story would be destroyed it wasn t the movie was nearly page for page faithful throughout right down to the killer s motive all the actors were wonderful but my favourite has got to be monica dolan who gives a great performance as miss gilchrist the companion to the late aunt cora without a doubt the best poirot movie ever 
this is a delightful they don t make em like this anymore kind of film well performed by everyone and peopled with interesting character actors an intelligent witty script acted with the right blend of broad comedy and understated humor holds up for repeated annual viewings warning the re make of this film with the same name directed by arnold whatwashethinking is an unbearable mess painful to watch without a scintilla of the charm and wit of the original 
for every fan of coming of age tales this hour adaptation of the sarah waters novel is pure fun cinematic nods to baz luhrman s kinetic style as well as to all those prim and proper period pieces ever present on the bbc where you re likely to have seen almost every prominent member of this cast it s rather bawdy and over the top in spots but that s just what the novel called for the cast is appealing and in the cases of anna chancellor and hugh bonneville perfect in the case of rachel sterling as our heroine nan you simply must overlook the fact that she s far too pretty to ever be mistaken for a boy and run with it it s a fantasy after all some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes in character particularly that of jodhi may s character florence but the changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay and provide an overall high quality entertainment value 
in case you dear readers never heard this movie was the main inspiration for last year s samuel l jackson eugene levy clunker the man this s drenched buddy action comedy pairs short n stubbly billy crystal and the late ethiopian shim shammer gregory hines together as some witty chi town cops who don t play by the rules that s pretty much the extent of the movie interest is somewhat peaked by hines line delivery that is spookily similar to will smith s and by cameos of now more famous actors like memento s joe pantoliano and nypd blue s jimmy smits my favorite scene is i dunno the car chase on the tracks i guess basically i just view this movie as a major helping hand in the demolition of action buddy flicks well this and lethal weapon and rush hour and the man

take a clich story and insert steve guttenberg need i say anymore this truly is as bad as you would expect sheriff tom palmer guttenberg and anna montgormery attempt to transform a group of useless inept kids into a winning soccer team lacking originality and direction from the offset it s quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film despite my reservations about guttenbergs acting ability i can safely say that the acting of the rival teams coach is actually worse than guttenbergs previously unimaginable i thought this type of story of underdogs battling all the way to the top has been done before and better every time than this so called film 
business vs personal conviction profit vs art as with any documentary that pits the capitalist large corporations against the small producer the viewer will invariably have to take the side of one or the other based on their own believes this is as much a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us against the old traditional ways where character and the art of making things matters almost more than getting the product sold if you have to remember one thing from this movie it is that the masses can no longer decide by themselves they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics that tend to equalize and standardize taste in the same way as macdonalds used to do for the fast bite something parker himself admits to in the film against a backdrop of a burger king sign it is all about image against content as another interviewee says that is the easy way the standardized way easier than taking the time for a nice wine to mature easier than to forge your own taste by trying and trying yet over again controlled branded taste is easier there is a glitter of hope when even some of our cousins across the ocean agree that a few people are levelling the taste of wines to maximize the profits and ensure a maximum of it gets sold to the grey masses individuality and difference is sacrificed for the extra buck it is nice to see that not everything or everyone is giving in to standardization even across the ocean as in many other areas of today s world dominance of a few and reduced freedom of choice impacts us all let everyone make up their mind and decide what to go for too much standardization kills the mind and taste difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice and not just vacuum packed more of the same standardization sells easily and a lot and brings everyone to the same level the lower one on this i am going to open up a nice bottle and wish you a hearthy sante 
 having read the unemployed critic s review i went to a screening of radio not knowing what to expect thankfully the unemployed critic now appears to me anyway a frustrated film director movie critic his review is callous and totally uncalled for this is a movie that will make you laugh it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause to paraphrase a line delivered by actor ed harris in the final barbershop scene and all this time that we thought we were teaching radio truth is he was teaching us he treats us all the time like we wish we treated each other some of the time yes the movie tugs at the heartstrings yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes cuba gooding jr in an oscar worthy performance is a little over the top at times see the christmas day dance scene but you know what so what every once in awhile the community of america needs to be reminded what tolerance can do for our great country we need to be reminded how great we can be this is a solid cast i was particularly pleased to see s epatha merkerson portraying radio s mother do something outside of law and order i always wondered is ms merkerson a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast on law and order after watching this movie it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actor also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is alfre woodard as the principal debra winger in a career resurrecting role of coach jones s wife and chris mulkey as protagonist frank clay we cannot over look ed harris s performance as coach harold jones after reflecting on this movie and having grown up in the deep south my self it is hard to truly appreciate mr harris and his contribution to this film as coach jones ed delivers a quiet rock solid performance that of a man on a mission coach harris will not let the town or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart is the right thing to do if you see this movie make sure you hang around for the end credits you will be in for a treat as the real james robert radio kennedy now in his mid s is shown still leading the t l hanna football team on to the field every friday night one final note if you were a teen in the mid to late s this movie is worth the price of admission for the sound track alone 
the rd in the series finds paul kersey bronson turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy i don t know why this movie shoved me into it but somehow it did i found myself rooting for bronson to wipe the floor with those punks every time he blew one of them away i felt good this movie does not take itself seriously but what if it did there is a good build up to the fireworks finale in which bronson goes on a rampage but as far as acting and plot go it just doesn t measure up if i lived in that neighborhood i would get out as fast as i could but it seems like the people are asking for trouble i know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets but there is a limit here folks i had to give it a sure there are good blow em away scenes but that s about it at that time bronson was i m sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with bronson bronson takes the place of a schwarzanegger or stallone in this movie this movie gives you a sense of rejoice the common man can save the neighborhood save the day to sum it up this is far from being the original death wish but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot em up 
it seems to be a common thing in the s to play with cliches some manage to do so with great talent herv hadmar doesn t on the paper the movie looked interesting though the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy dark humour and a very d cal style director hadmar unfortunately kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater the movie is incredibly slow and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they re doing in this ridiculous mascarade what could have been a stylish funny mindless comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom 
a friend of mine showed me this film yesterday and i was really amazed that someone could make a movie this terrible mix the most awful clich d dialog with the most wooden acting you ve ever seen with the cheesiest special effects know to man and you get this magnificent beast vampire assassins is funnier than most comedies i ve seen it really is awful i was in stitches during the scene where the ex cop vampire assassin character is having coffee with the internet journalist just watch it and you ll see what i mean i honestly can t believe that someone made this with serious intentions tragic but a really good laugh it has to be seen to be believed 
i won t spoil it for you although you probably could care less if it was spoiled you ll know what i mean after you watch it poor story b rated movie quality typical horror stupid situations rare timing i should of known when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add quotes just tells me that the movie bombed big time and they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb i wish i could take back the time i spent watching this i was stupid and thought that there just had to be something great around the corner but i kept getting let down i don t usually waste my time adding comments to any movie in fact this is my second post i just felt maybe i could spare a few of you from wasting money on something that had a bunch of hype on it 
if you wondered whether disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than paris more shallow than britney more vapid than jessica and more narcissistic than the girls next door wonder no more the amazing thing is selena gomez is apparently supposed to be the heroine she s also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled shallow vapid narcissistic popular girls at school which is no more believable here than it was for hilary duff in lizzie mcguire plots range from recycled bewitched i dream of jeannie to parodies of harry potter the older boy alternates between being a magical genius and being unable to master the complexities of his own shoelaces the younger boy is just another of the smart mouth wisecracking brats who have multiplied on tv like cockroaches in new york and with the same appeal the dad is the stereotypical dumb tv dad and the mom well she s not totally awful but all pales beside the hideous loathsome and yet horribly fascinating like a bad car accident spectacle of ms lopez smug self satisfied snotty performance and again she s the heroine 
how many movies are there going to be in which against all odds a ragtag team beats the big guys with all the money there s nothing new in the big green if anything you want them to lose steve guttenberg used to have such a good resume the boys from brazil police academy cocoon why oh why did he have to do these sorts of movies during the s and beyond so just avoid this movie there are plenty of good movies out there so there s no reason to waste your time and money on this junk obviously the green on their minds was money because there s no creativity here at least in recent years disney has produced some clever movies with pixar 
being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary i was eager to see how the subject matter was handled unfortunately the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history this film only concerns itself with the period within new york city ignoring the rest of the country while i spent a fair amount of time in nyc at that time i can assure you that there was a gay life outside manhattan the men interviewed here are the same a list queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the s and here they are again waxing nostalgic and still throwing attitude the film should have at least tried to cover larger topics such as race ageism the burgeoning gay caste system based on wealth body image and the rise of the clones discrimination of sub groups within the community and the ability to grow a decent mustache which was very important in the s alas we have none of this presented and the recollections of those interviewed are no different than my own memories if you were there in that decade you ll enjoy the archival photos and grainy home movies of the bars and discos we haunted if you weren t there this film will undoubtedly seem dull it should have been so much more but sadly it s not two stars for jogging my memory i still miss going to the anvil 
i love horror films but i think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind the devil s backbone the exorcist for example this is that kind of film and it s not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be it is also really beautiful a tale of two sisters starts really slow so if you re in a hurry to see ghosts in the first minutes you will be disappointed actually this is not a ghost story though there are some it s something more complex and it s done in such a way that it beats ringu and the grudge out of the ring no sweat a tale is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits because it really cares for its characters and the direction is flawless every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you re the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie the acting is superb specially from the stepmother and the main girl those two are worth the price of the ticket alone do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film 
alfred hitchcock s remake of the man who who knew too much is usually not considered to be as good as the original but for me it is one of the best films ever i prefer it over vertigo and rear window like north by northwest it is the story of an average man who is unwillingly thrown into the world of international intrigue james stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy he will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family while the original was good for it s time it is hard to watch by today s standards the remake has excellent production quality an endearing doris day and a really creepy villain don t bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and over 
new rule nobody is allowed to make any more zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original idea sadly this movie doesn t they have the premise that bounty hunters go out and kill zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers well problems with that most people have ten fingers why not just collect ten bounties for one zombie why not just kill a regular person and pass that off as a zombie finger not to mention the utter silliness of hunting zombies with a bolt action rifle i sometimes think films like this are resume fillers for makeup and fx guys hey this is what i did with ten dollars and some recylced bottles deposit imagine what i could do if you gave me a budget do you think anyone goes to drama school or cinema school to star in a zombie movie i went to the school of the arts check me out as the tunnel zombie in quick and the undead his mother must be so proud these had to be the wimpiest zombies ever as a whole crowed of them apparently couldn t push down a wooden door or even break a glass window no they had to wait for the bounty hunter to open the door for them 
the core message is strong the cast has given it their best shot the packaging is excellent but the screenplay is seriously over dramatized and every cliche in the book on women s suffering in india has been over used to the max 
hi being able to speak cantonese i found this very funny and was able to all the jokes that one might not get due to language barriers the fight scenes are spectacular and it s a good movie however i have my criticisms first of all i find that it is not as good as the first one project a go and see that now reason is spoilers ahead don t read on if you haven t seen the film because in project a jackie ends by fighting his enemy the man he is sent to kill sanpao that is what he has been striving to do all the film and the showdown is spectacular but in a ii hough he fights chan the showdown scene between jackie and his nemesis is not long enough and the bulk of the action is against the empress s men they are not nearly as bad enough and have only played a minor part in the film in relation to jackie so though their fight sequence is spectacular they are not the ones jackie is hunting throughout the whole of the film so thus leaving the viewer slightly unfulfilled however this is just my humble opinion so don t take it word for word go and see it yourself it is a great film in it s own right take care and hope your admiration for jackie grows yours sincerely ian ps you know the police chief in a ii he s the same guy in first strike nice to know he s still going strong 
i have had more boring stretches of minutes in my life but none are coming to mind right now hell ride is based on the retro cult s theme that tarantino brought back and did right in movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs the problem with hell ride is unlike pf and rd the story is garbage and so is character development how many movies does bishop think he can blatantly steal from the brief case in pulp fiction the air gun in no country etc etc speaking of bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie i couldn t help but laugh at those scenes where he s standing with his pelvis trusted out desperately trying to seem like some hardened biker nothing in this movie is believable and why dennis hopper did they really need the easy rider motif too i blame larry bishop for his horrible plot and dialogue not to mention his failed attempt at the leading role don t bother watching this movie it s a waste of time 
from the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible hercules comes its even more preposterous read goofier sequel right off the bat we get another unwieldy beginning of time prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a superman like scrolling credits sequence narrative wise here we have four rebellious gods who steal zeus seven all important but poorly animated thunderbolts a crime which for one thing sets the moon careening on a collision course with planet earth faster than you can say nepotism zeus once again played as a white haired bearded man by the relatively young claudio cassinelli sends his champion who has now rightfully taken his place among the elite thanks to one presumes the almighty tasks performed in the first film to find his blooming thunderbolts and avert the calamities in store no sooner has hercules lou ferrigno as if you didn t know touched the earthly surface that he comes in contact with two attractive damsels milly carlucci and sonia viviani in need of his getting them out of distress the former who would go on to become an italian tv personality seemingly has the ability to talk with the little people which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from godzilla vs mothra just so they can swindle as much unutilzed footage from the first film as is humanly possible the divine quartet of villains resurrect good ol king minos william berger again from his skeletal slumber and pit him once more against his eternal enemy typically hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly foes including a gorgon an awfully underproduced sequence which ought to have led to a surefire plagiarism suit had the film makers behind the much superior clash of the titans bothered to watch this flick complete with the same reflection in a shield come uppance and preceded by the muscleman letting the audience in on his tactics before executing them as if to show us how clever he is and just to make it crystal clear that he wears his influences on his sleeve cozzi has hercules and minos turn into a cosmic version of king kong vs godzilla for one of their battles and later still king kong gets to grips with a large snake an encounter lifted straight out of the classic original i swear it this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth as had been the case with the first film the cast is full of old reliables like the afore mentioned berger cassinelli and venantino venantini as a sorcerer with a truly bad hair day and up and coming starlets not just carlucci but also maria rosaria omaggio as a younger hera serena grandi pamela prati and once again eva robbins whose costume here easily outcamps her appearance in the first film for what it s worth pino donaggio s score for this one is recycled from musical cues featured in his soundtrack for the previous film if you have stuck with this review so far you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take either dismiss it in one unflattering sentence or spend an undeserving amount of time dissecting its flaws i m sure i ve left out some of its ineptitudes but i wouldn t forgive myself if i failed to mention the single greatest laugh out loud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair yes it even surpassed the afore mentioned animated titanic duel for me namely the d cor of the rebellious gods lair which is in the shape of a giant marble kettle at this stage one might well wonder why i gave this film and its predecessor a rating instead of a not entirely unjustified bomb in the past i ve had various protracted online discussions on whether one s star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality or its sheer entertainment value but these are two instances where i deemed it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in settling on my final rating i don t know maybe it s because i m in a sword and sandal state of mind at the moment with some more respectable examples scheduled for the coming days but after all uncharacteristically for me i decided to add these two films to my dvd collection simply based on the fun i had with them in this recent revisit and that alone must count for something no 
hellraiser bloodline is only a so so film i believe it s the fourth installment in the hellraiser series i missed the beginning and all i remember from there was some topless women and a box shape thing on a computer screen but using my wit and intelligence and the info button i soon found out that the villain pinhead was released from pandora s box which i believe is a gateway straight to hell so anyways pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the toymaker s family and that s about it oh and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path yawn what mainly happens in this film is that pinhead captures the kid and then unleashes the dog on his wife and then kills a random person then he husband comes along blah blah blah who cares why it fails is because hellraiser bloodline is too corny to be scary look at pinhead s minion of creatures a cheesy dog that looks like it s been turned inside out two men whose heads and bodies are connected together siamese twins in a horror film and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort i haven t seen the previous films now look at the main villain his name is pinhead isn t that the name you call somebody when they re stupid he has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers and he has blue skin i suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn t have such a corny name and a corny speech somewhere in the film two cops approach him and say don t make us put some pain on you pinhead replies pain how dare you use that word i am pain blah blah blah blah blah it sounds a bit clich if you ask me don t forget the final half of the movie the characters and audience get to experience more torture when pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum some person who we don t recognize maybe he was in the previous films i don t remember him in the beginning of the movie this scene is basically one thing played over and over again a guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise some other guard oh no he s down i will go check on him by myself after he dies the same thing happens again spoilers here s the thing i didn t get in the film pinhead is supposedly sent to oblivion at the end so how does he come back for another four films are they prequels why hasn t he died in the previous ones geez the makers need to come up with an idea for a different series end of spoilers hellraiser bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes but has little thrill or scare value just forget it bad special effects with bad everything else make this more of a snooze fest than a good horror good well some people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning plus pinhead s voice is pretty cool i suppose if you like ultra violence you might like this too bad none of the reasons above make this a very good film the corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad and who names their villain pinhead feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment 
a killer john karlen with a penchant for really bad disguises afro wig on a white dude cruises around in his van looking for victims detective decarlo james luisi is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird again the afro wig comes into play tracking the killer to his home decarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist inspired by the crimes of ted bundy before he was caught killer s delight is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick director jeremy hoenack has no idea how to pace a film or even make it suspenseful he does know how to show lots of close ups of the killer wringing his hands though the only thing this really has going for it is the captured s atmosphere look out for the bathroom wallpaper well that and a downbeat ending the media blasters shriek show dvd has lots of nice stuff though including an audio commentary by hoenack and karlen plus video interviews trailers and an alternate opening 
documentaries about fans are always mishmashes and never worth seeing through but i found this one made by some of the fans themselves more than usually unenlightening as a veteran of the original tolkien craze forty years ago i d hoped for more than the obvious which doesn t always equate to the true if there s anyone living who doesn t already know the nature of a fandom any fandom from having been or known a fan he won t discover it here between irrelevancies platitudes to which the actors from the films are particularly prone and acting out by fans making the most if not the best of their one shot at fame i could glean little of the special appeal of lotr the special emotional responses it evokes and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take in addition the film is rather lazy it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort e g what the exact legal loophole was the wording of a copyright notice that permitted the books unauthorized publication in the u s speaking of which i take strong exception to the film s dismissal of the covers on that edition as irrelevant and psychedelic which they were not they were the work of jack gaughan a very able sf illustrator of the period and some fans including me found them more apt and more attractive than the covers on the rival set 
i totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who bashed the film having read the book being impressed by it although this is a kind of literature that you cannot really like similar to hubert selby s writing i expected being shocked but the effect was more subtle than this isabelle hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi layered character there are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and i can imagine few actresses who would do so well with so much disregard for their own reputation or image there is this coldness distance cruelty and at the same time there s this helplessness hurt and pain there s a person who s in control and controlled at the same time maybe this is not realistic although when you read the newspaper you ll read about much worse than this but there s a truth to it that is very difficult to bear i think it s an excellent film but i did not enjoy watching it it s not boring but there are times when i wished it would end btw her male counterpart is very well acted as well and i think well chosen too 
it s true no one really expects anything from sequels but even by that low standard this is a terrible film essentially an anthology movie this fourth installment in the hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a wind up to the entire series at the same time an ambitious idea but none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling the result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending unless you re an alan smithee fan avoid this one 
well i ll begin with this i love horror movies not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present second this is the worst movie of all times it even beats mean guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes and for that i pay it homage however the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad to my great surprise the reviews where somewhat divided and you guys who rated this piece of c movie crap from and up i know you re joking good one hahaha because if there is any reason in the world and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is you can t be for real everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up so i ll leave it minor spoiler alert but the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog kennel for ten minutes with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two really does it for me 
an unusual revisionist western well worth watching despite a slow start the film builds with scarcely any dialogue and no subtitles an increasingly involving and intense almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the western desert the growth of the lead characters is worth waiting for and the strong central cast bring a real sense of desperation to the struggle for ownership of the all important horse how interesting that this was made by a british director i hope he s smiling now i get the impression the film was largely ignored by contemporaries but time works its usual alchemy and hidden gold shines out as it inevitably must one note jarred for me the revisionism is only carried so far sam waterston as an indian granted he plays his part with real emotion and intensity but really couldn t one american indian actor be found to do the job but his scenes with caroline langrishe have an intimacy which contrasts nicely with the immense landscape around them forget big bankrupt hollywood versions of the past men with big chins and swirling music this one is all about a primeval struggle between protagonists who stripped of all the trappings of ordinary life come to understand what is worth fighting for impressive 
sergei eisenstein s most famous movie has truly withstood the test of time the story of a mutiny aboard a warship in does have the feeling of soviet propaganda but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt the scene on the odessa steps should remain seared into anyone s mind okay so the battleship potemkin wasn t actually the first movie to use montage but they did a great job with it here certainly any film history class should show this movie it s a great historical drama although i will admit that i don t know how accurate it is a oh and we should have learned by now that potemkin should be transliterated as potyomkin 
bill paxton has taken the true story of the us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra ordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti catholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds the acting is exemplary throughout stephen dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class franco irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slap stick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears a old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie 
my parents may enjoy this show but i fail to find the humor in it what is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team absolutely nothing it s a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays blame that on shows like the dating game and the newlywed game bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid s sure the series has its touching moments still that s no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series this is nothing like the family oriented days of i love lucy some five decades before an answer i would have to why this series plays on the lifetime cable channel is because that channel s brass think women can relate to reba s character i absolutely dislike the character of reba hart s daughter kyra she is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager funny i wonder if the actress who played kyra scarlett pomers is like that in real life away from acting who plays the blockhead ex husband dentist christopher rich is not much better barbara jean played by melissa peterman is ditsy in herself the characters of van and cheyenne are also very annoying something else that baffles me is why the dingbat of a series creator allison m gibson decided to set the series in where i live miles away from houston texas reba mcentire isn t even from this state she s an oklahoman why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting what i mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it but the melodies are basically tuneless 
it s strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best you ve seen this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller guns techno baddies cash etc and yet it stands out from your average hollywood also ran i would credit this to two very charismatic people christopher walken has a cool confidence and lorraine bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women i ve ever seen on screen another major reason why this film stands out is coz the setting shifts to jamaica after the beginning the jamaican resort is so beautiful you ll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night with a run n coke i know i did i m very glad i saw this movie it was just too nice to miss 
the recent release of mad dog morgan on troma dvd is disappointing this appears to be a censored print for television viewing some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic dvd version mad dog morgan deserves to be released on dvd in the original theatrical cut however even as released on dvd the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century australia after having toured the old melbourne gaol with death masks of convicts on display it is mad dog morgan that comes to mind 
i thought this was a really well written film i ve heard of radio the person before this movie was even created and i can t begin to describe how good cuba gooding jr was in it it will make the women cry everyone laugh and most everyone will leave smiling 
i won t go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating plenty of other people have already done that suffice it to say that out of the over movies that i ve owned on dvd this is the only one that i got rid of it was so worthless that i couldn t see ever wanting to watch any of it again however i do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of as of while skimming through the pages of reviews i saw no rating higher than stars looking at the voting history of users rated the movie as stars or less it looks to me like a few people are stuffing the ballot box to keep this movie off of the imdb bottom list it would be interesting to see how many of the users who rated this movie as stars none of who wrote a review of the movie are actual active users don t be fooled this movie isn t worth your time 
i know my summary sounds very harsh but this film has very limited appeal the average joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film the entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs this is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum however unless you really love this sort of art or are a canadian who loves films about your native land then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish i have a rather high tolerance for this sort of thing and even i had to force myself to watch after a couple minutes i can respect the work that went into it but it s just not compelling 
haggard the movie is the real life story of ryan dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend a skate boarder who lives for nothing and a trying to be funny scientist which doesn t really work played by bam margera and brandom dicamillo the film haggard the movie also has a lot of the characters from jackass etc but to say it was written by bam margera and co this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to the films also stars bam s girlfriend jennifer rivell who plays glauren ryan s girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is steve a k a hellboy played by rakeyohn which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring but worst of all is raab s character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also i think he could have been improved overall i think the characters in this film aren t with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character to say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character ryan dunn although a lot of the attention is on bam and brandon in conclusion this film is ok if you laugh at things that aren t very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene also i think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music 
i think is a great and a very funny movie the story is so funny the daughter nicole brings her father andre in some very embarrassing situations in an effort to impress the boy of her dreams the daughter pretends that her father is her lover you just have to see heigl is lovely as nicole perhaps too lovely i m not sure why she d need to lie to hook anyone gerard depardieu acts very great in this comedy film he is so fun to watch if you like comedy and romantic film you just have to see this i think you can see this film many time and you will still have a good laugh in an effort to impress the boy of her dreams the girl pretends that her father is her lover 
kramer vs kramer is a near heartening drama about shocking drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple meryl streep in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity plays an unhappy stay at home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband in a fantastic performance by dustin hoffman to find another role for herself hoffman is dumbstruck having absolutely no idea what to do with himself having taken so much for granted that he doesn t know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks he is restless relentless and impatient but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to he s been focused on his career in advertising and when he is left to raise his son billy all by himself chaos ushers in immediately he s the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity after awhile as he befriends his neighbor and joanna s former friend played by sexy jane alexander hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left in the meantime his boundless energy redirects towards raising billy and he loses his job the custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance even if the ending is a little unmotivated subjectified for the audience the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical s 
i watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick the shonky production values and low rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci fi channel style knock offs the central performance from bill moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act the rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever the cinematography is dull flat and completely uninspired like so many of these kind of films it doesn t even manage a decent bit of convincing gore the zombie make up is literally pathetic apart from one notable exception towards the end of the film the film tries to inject originality and a message into it s concoction of half baked and ripped off ideas by somehow equating this outbreak with intolerance towards islam and the war on terror this is woefully handled with all the intellectual clout of a year old as the characters and seemingly the writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion describing all people of a certain skin colour as muslims most notably one character is revealed to be muslim by skin colour alone at the same time the muslim terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype presumably the far far superior pontypool had a similar budget as dead air yet shines everywhere where this film fails miserably 
the only time i seem to trawl through imdb comments is when i ve seen a duff film i guess i m looking to find reassurance that it s not just me for me then lonesome jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop out hackneyed conclusion so i check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like jim out on a limb alienated as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties yet maybe i should check the settings for the comments presentation since after a while the gushing dies down and i m relieved to see appreciations that mirror my own i feel vindicated it is a rubbish film it doesn t hang together and it does constitute a wasted evening sitting through it praise be to kindred spirits 
no holds barred is that movie that when you were nine or ten was the coolest movie this side of arnold schwarzenegger but then when you grow up and watch it you feel embarrassed that you were so gullible to have liked it you feel cheated embarrassed and stupid if you have a little brother and you show him this and he tells you it s gay give him a high five and take him to the strip bar for his eleventh birthday 
it s a male bashing bonanza i saw this on sci fi a while ago and the idea seemed interesting it could have been a good movie and the plot itself i don t see as male bashing but certain specific references to men get really annoying i might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by hinting that maybe the women in the movie aren t really as non violent as they claim but it still doesn t compensate for the really tiring male bashing i mean i can understand a little it s part of the movie s plot but come on it gets really tiring after awhile not only that but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority as to go in the closet it s just too unbelievable there are far too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions that would balk at this it is totally implausible i mean i know its sci fi and i love sci fi but the best sci fi has at least a hint of it being possible and this is too implausible the phrase truth is stranger than fiction came about because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcomed but truth isn t always this movie is not that other than that the movie does have some good acting and the eventual morals of the story that something like what happened was wrong do redeem it a little but not enough 
many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message thus confusing the hero not to mention the audience dr ben mckenna james stewart and his wife jo a former musical star doris day are vacationing in morocco with their son hank christopher olsen when they meet mr and mrs drayton a british couple brenda de banzie and bernard miles they are also befriended by a charming frenchman louis bernard daniel gelin who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute the mackennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the draytons when they spot louis bernard the next day in the market place they are caught in an assassination intrigue while they are wandering in the local market the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an arab fleeing from his pursuers dr mckenna stands amazed as the arab falls into his arms a knife sticking out of his back gulping his last breath the dying man mutters some words and collapses dr mckenna is completely taken aback when the arab s hood falls from his head and he is revealed as bernard in disguise mckenna is left knowing too little but as far as the assassins are concerned too much to prevent dr mckenna from revealing what he knows the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage the film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnapping how to get the little boy back safely the subplot about the assassination is just the setup the film is a breathless escapade the death of bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it stewart is charged with emotion as the midwestern doctor accidentally involved in political intrigue his perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly human a person we could easily identify with it is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film by the lovely doris day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer she had been particularly strong opposite james cagney in the ruth etting s biopic love me or leave me but she was still unsure of her basic thespian talents the casting of character actor reggie malder as the assassin is brilliant the man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil 
when i was in th grade back in i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came out a year later kristy mcnichol was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job she carries the movie well esther rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears to be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaks as the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parent s affection bruce davidson is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the title the best performance however belongs to michael constantine it is truly powerful and merited more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations the film differs from the book only in some small ways it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 
it s awful pretty succinct review i know but it has been a long time since a film has left me in such a bewildered state wondering how the hell a film like that gets made the last time it happened was last years turkey mission to mars salvatore coco is an ex con trying to better himself through self help videos endless seminars and betterment courses he lives by the catchphrases these courses expound he stumbles across a washed up nightclub singer played by nikki bennett and has an epiphany his new career is going to be that of a talent agent with the singer as his one and only client financed by his gospel singing paraplegic girlfriend played by sasha horler he sets up shop and tries to relaunch nikki s career with disastarous results walk the talk is the reason why australians are so contemptuous of australian cinema it is poorly constructed lame and way wayyy too long minutes for a comedy that should barely have scraped the minute mark every scene is too long and are very repetitive the audience is not given a character to empathise with a vital ingredient in a film like this supposedly about an underdog giving it a go the downbeat and frankly poor ending comes at the end of minutes of the most mind numbing dialogue and scenes that have you crying out for a power failure this film is a failure on all levels made worse for queensland audiences by its liberal and innacurate use of various gold coast palm beach location and its laughable use of brisbane suburb names like norman park and caboolture 
i do not write reviews here often but i can not stand by and let other people suffer through this movie without a least trying to warn them this movie is horrible and it is not because i do not know what the director was trying to convey or i am too stupid to understand the plot this movie is horrible because of poor direction screen writing and acting this is the trifecta of bad move making and the reason the film was direct to video it tries to be something like high tension hostel and tcsm with the lifting of some of those ideas but it just does not work i did not have high expectations or even medium ones going into the film but was still very disappointed it had potential to be very good with a nice setting and good idea for a film but it was wasted 
oddly enough the independent film channel showed this film a week after it showed karate bear fighter even though the bear film was the second in the trilogy and this film was the first what were they thinking while all three of these films are supposedly based on the life of this great kyokushin karate master you can t help but think that they must have embellished the story quite a bit especially in this first film sure the guy evidently did fight and kill a bull and later a bear in fact he fought and killed many bulls during his career but in this film set in the early s at the end of the film the hero actually fights about guys and kills many of them brutally i just can t imagine that this really occurred so i did some checking and found that while many of the details are correct some of this film is pure bunk yes he did kill a man in self defense and yes he did follow the widow and her son and spent a year working for them trying to get them to forgive him but the end of the film is great to watch but hogwash seeing one of his opponents get a staff thrust through his head and all the other gory details couldn t have happened or else the japanese government would have locked oyama up to protect society the film is entertaining and the fighting is excellent there are no complaints about the action or acting the only minor complaint is the camera work which is a tad sloppy during some of the fight scenes despite this minor complaint this is a most enjoyable film in many ways the wandering karate master theme is pretty reminiscent of the zatoichi films which are also lots of fun to watch but many of the exploits are truly impossible fyi there is an englished dubbed version of this film entitled champion of death and i just saw it as well it s not a bad dubbing and it was letter boxed a big plus but still i prefer the subtitled version 
what that was it the town sheriff john agar blows up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin did i just write that did i just see that with instrumentals by the wildcats night fright is one flick that never deserved to be made as late as the heyday of the gorilla was well over and anyone other than ray corrigan in an ape suit is just asking for trouble remake this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you d have at least a rating on the imdb but sadly this one never should have stood a chance of seeing the light of day oops there s another quirk you can never tell if it s day or night in the story since they seem interchangeable with one another i ll give you this though a couple of the early malt shop scenes looked like they could have gone on the air as coke commercials thinking about it now those were probably the best looking and best lit scenes of the picture coca cola must have paid for them had they seen the completed movie they might have been better served to prevent it s release 
i am currently years old and remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it first came out you heard me right i was years old and yet i can still distinctly remember what i saw that afternoon so many years ago was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of mark twain s creativity no on the other hand it was a quite creepy film about mark twain s dark depressed and in fact suicidal side one scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which mark twain is playing the organ at his own funeral would an adult enjoy this film well this movie quite possibly features some interesting viewpoints that a person with a working knowledge of mark twain s writing might enjoy but trust me on this adventures is not the film you want to use to introduce your young children to mark twain 
mixed group of experts explorers divers and scientists venture a mile underground and go another miles underwater to a spot even more remote where they find salamanders giant albino moles and some big razor fanged winged computer generated creatures lurking about the cave is sealed off by a rockslide and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone off as they search for an exit and that s all she wrote with this low aiming effort that even fails to combine action science fiction and horror on the most elementary of levels imagine if someone gave the folks at the sci fi channel million dollars to make a monster movie that s precisely what the cave is like almost startling in its ineptitude at times full of clich s and almost entirely dependent on the special effects to entertain the only difference is they had more money to build sets more money to polish up the monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who give awful performances anyway otherwise it s business as usual some of these movies are still fun to watch this one is not and there are loads of reasons why it takes itself far too seriously and has no sense of humor whatsoever so you get a completely unoriginal and predictable movie that doesn t even recognize how unoriginal and predictable it is the opening sequence serves no purpose whatsoever other than killing a few minutes and adding to the redundancy unoriginal looking cgi creatures are not impressing anyone in this day and age utilizing shakycam and quick cut editing for your horror scenes is simply lazy unimaginative film making and why further obscure the action by making things too dark and adding annoying distractions such as fire and explosion of bubbles it makes these scenes not only difficult to see but also impossible to enjoy even on a no brainer action level even though it wants you take to it seriously the script is full of clich s the dialogue is awful and there s no attempt whatsoever at characterization casting year old looking model types in roles as brilliant scientists and gruff veteran explorers might provide some eye candy but it completely kills the credibility of a movie that otherwise plays out completely straight sorry you can t have it both ways there were two exceptions to the model rule as they did decide to cast an old guy and an average looking joe these were the first two characters killed off for a little diversity they also squeezed in a black guy and a chinese guy strangely neither are given much of a voice in this film and basically stand in the background as whitey discusses what their next move will be insulting furthermore how many movies have to be made where a black character sacrifices his life at the very end just to ensure hot white female lead and hot white male lead end up together at the end ugh give me a break already much of the acting was horrible cole hauser s performance was completely laughable the other male lead looked like he just walked off the set of a soap opera and coasted by using the patented dimpled smile makes all the ladies swoon technique which is the pg gender switch equivalent to my large breasts make all the guys swoon technique often used by ladies in r rated films either way his performance was completely phoned in daniel dae kim from the tv series lost and piper perabo also stunk up the room with their stilted and monotone line delivery was the ending a joke absolutely terrible please god we do not need a sequel to this garbage so basically i wouldn t bother with this one unless you ve never seen a monster movie before or if you re just really desperate and the only other thing on is the simple life the sets were good the blue tinted photography is ok and a few of the actors lena headey marcel iures tried their best so i decided to boost the rating up one notch to a 
the academy award winning kramer vs kramer follows a snazzy businessman ted kramer dustin hoffman and his divorce with his bored wife meryl streep one day ted s wife leaves him and their child in search for a better life forcing ted to become closer to his son justin henry the two bond and become very close but only after some friction and just as everything is going perfect ted s wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son ted then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him and fights his wife in court dustin hoffman gives a tremendous performance along with meryl streep and young justin henry is impressive it s a sad emotional roller coaster of a movie but it s a very well made and inspiring film the film took the oscar for best picture at the academy awards along with best actor for hoffman and best supporting actress for streep if you don t mind a tearjerker kramer vs kramer is a great film to watch grade b 
this movie will undoubtably not go over well with some because most of the horror is mental but it does have a little something for almost everyone including a couple of really cool abduction scenes with aliens the film makes extensive use of alien abduction mythology while also showing a bit more intelligence about some facets of abduction myths than you would expect out of a movie jillian mcwhirter is excellent in what had to have been a grueling performance 
this one and the one prior toulon s revenge and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice it is basically choose your series the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers while the next three are a series of them being the good guys this one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and i never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series basically a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action japanese shows like ultraman the movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not inflicting you with a very painful to watch movie just to many plot holes and things in it for it to be considered an okay movie you do get to see the guy who played toulon in the last movie though then you have a very anti climatic battle and wham the movie is over before it really begins 
at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called the final executioner at least where i come from a bloke is trained by an ex cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood and that s about it lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue has one of the weirdest array of costumes i ve seen in a film for a while and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by people great job on the dubbing too guys best moment when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck he just gets out his gun and bang why not do that earlier it s a mystery as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place i m still puzzling over that one myself now 
nightbreed is not only great it is also unique even taking into account other barker s movies which never lack originality an amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book for the horror genre it has quite a few of subtle symbolics and references certainly a lot of fun to have a a bit to think about if one cares to and not to forget a nice music score well the special effects as usual get old faster than anything but that is probably the only drawback i ve just seen it again after ten years and i still find it something to recommend 
tipping the velvet tv was directed by geoffrey sax for bbc television the basic plot is a coming of age story for the protagonist nan astley played well by rachael stirling as a teenager nan works in her family run oyster house everyone expects her to stay at home then marry an appropriate husband and settle down to family life nan expects this too everything changes when nan meets kitty butler keeley hawes a beautiful and talented performer who dresses in men s clothes and captures the hearts of her audience the audience includes nan who is sexually attracted to kitty in a way in which she s not attracted to her boyfriend the remainder of the film follows nan to london and through her ups sort of and her downs horrible as a lesbian and sometimes male impersonator as is typical for the bbc every role no matter how small is performed by an excellent actor the bbc has a depth and breadth of performing artists that is truly marvelous none of the supporting actors stands out in my mind they were uniformly good both stirling and hawes are wonderful and their acting carries the film along it s always sad to be reminded of how difficult life can be for someone who doesn t fit society s mold for what is normal i know it isn t easy for lesbians even in the u s even today imagine the obstacles to love and happiness for lesbians in victorian england we ve come a long way but we still have a long way to travel 
i hate to admit it but i didn t find it to be one of hitchcock s best but nonetheless a riveting climatic thriller in a remake of hitchock s movie of the same title dr ben mckenna james stewart the man who knows too much and his wife jo mckenna doris day are holidaying in morocco with their son hank christopher oslen when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot the conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot kidnapping their beloved hank i found it surprising that doris day who i usually associate with rock hudson comedies was cast in a hitchcock film as i was watching it i soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to hitchcock s other works example psycho and she had singing ability needed to pull off que sera sera which she did beautifully she was well cast as herself and james stewart had chemistry which helped make the couple believable in comparison to the great director s other works i believe this isn t as good but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller mystery there is also the added bonus of que sera sera which turned out to be a smash hit for doris day well directed well acted a fine film 
this really is a film of two halves the first detailing the lives and friendship of two boys one a privileged pashtun and the other a down trodden hazara in late s afghanistan before the invasion by the ussr works extremely well the young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark relief the real problem comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the pashtun as a man living in america ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things break down the central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic but in fact comes across as wimpish and wallowing in self pity it is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see that of his boyhood friend once he returns to afghanistan the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly contrived coincidences most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately even though he is not looking for him despite the chaos that has since consumed the country this enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible the resolution of the narrative is also run through with an awful mawkish sentimentality which undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to make although it is possible to start seeing characters and the abuses of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which engages with any wider political discussion instead the narrative becomes reduced to one character s emotional journey of self discovery and healing unfortunately this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story while opportunities to make a really interesting film about afghanistan itself are wasted 
i haven t been a fan of madonna for quite sometime now however i thought i would comment on this film this film mistaken one of them as well as madonna was panned by the critics they were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews first madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first she plays a ditsy blonde in the film she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didn t give her a fair shake when you view this film i hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting she was absolutely hysterical as was the film griffen dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film if you take a look at his filmography you will see he is quite an accomplished actor as far as the movie itself this is something similar to pretty woman but came years before the roberts gere success it s a goof ball comedy with lots of site gags slapstick and one liners some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor i know this doesn t tell you much about the movie however i hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie it is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun peace gary
i saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the london film festival structurally it has been compared to pulp fiction but it is perhaps closer to the structure of amores perros and the slacker mood of kevin smith s clerks four stories intersect at a french motorway diner the first vignette has franck edouard baer bungling a hold up at the diner the waitress suzie anna mouglalis takes pity and tell him her story the second has two incompetent kidnappers leon bouli lanners and paul serge lariviere take a teenage girl from her rich family unfortunately for them she is suicidal and her family don t appear to want her back the third is a dialogue between two ageing rock stars who bump into each other at the diner alain bashung and arno playing themselves the final part is about four ex criminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into the diner an epilogue returns to franck and suzie to complete their story not really an epilogue more a conclusion the structure does not really work the stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in pulp fiction nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of amores perros the quality of the individual stories varies the hideout story is a cute idea with a couple of good gags but does not come off and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull on the other hand the kidnap story is hilarious although its connection to the diner is tenuous the most balanced and successful story is the franck and suzie one this film isn t entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity i look forward to seeing more of writer director s samuel benchetrit s work 
i got this on a double feature dvd called scream theater and it s no doubt one of the most terrible movies i ve ever seen and i ve seen some really bad ones school s out and of three girls who if they re teenagers i d eat my hat are talking about non stop party so of course they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the most strict for a slumber party meanwhile a psychotic has escaped the local bug house where one girl s father works is on the loose with sharp objects and wearing green scrubs and sporting wide open eyes i guess that s to show he s bonkers of course since he has a bone to pick with that particular doctor off he goes to his house the location of which is apparently common knowledge in the meantime some dumb jock types are slamming down beers and out to scare the girls and of course the loony shows up too and starts cutting throats and that s about it as the heavy metal music chugs along in the background or maybe that s not it but really that s all you need to know unless you spend your time perpetually stoned or drunk you ll find little of interest here and even if you are wasted most of the time you ll still probably find your intelligence insulted out of 
ok i normally don t add comments on movies but i finally watched a movie that was so utterly full of bullsh t and riddled with incompetence that i just had to warn people about blackwater valley exorcist is loosely about a wife beating pederast priest and this podunk family of horse freaks and to make a long story short the youngest daughter who was molested by the priest but in love with the hillbilly ranch hand gets possessed along with a heroic god shunning mexican gardener who once participated in a exorcism the wife beating pederast priest manage to save the day but not before the possessing demon is able to jump over to a hooker who the town sheriff made blow him all in all this movie is the biggest pile of useless i could get very descriptive with this part but why waste my energy on this movie sh t i ve ever seen any and all persons associated with the making of this movie should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the earth with their useless spawn 
sheltered young woman home schooled and possibly quite gifted harbors a disturbed overly emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit asking for a divorce directed by celebrated cinematographer william a fraker this ill titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in each shot is composed for the utmost style but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight gripping narrative fraker and his cinematographer l szl kov cs are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones giving the picture a burnished tableaux feel the mansion at the center of the action looks like a funeral parlor and fraker paces the wheezing yarn just like a funeral robert shaw and sally kellerman as shaw s fianc e two of the most interesting actors of the s manage to cut through the plastic overlay and are quite compelling despite the jagged editing which turns their scenes into little bits of half realized business sondra locke another interesting screen personality seems cast for her resemblance to catherine deneuve in repulsion pale and saucer eyed with imposingly thick and long hair locke is a curious human puzzle and she s initially quite intimidating and dangerous however this role is so old hat that locke can find nothing fresh to bring out of the deep freeze and she flounders fraker allows locke s freak out scenes to go on and on while shaw looking terrifically debonair is put in the impossible position of playing touchy feely daddy to her all of this nonsense might be worth slogging through if the screenplay had been peppered with a modicum of tangibility or at the very least some dry wit or humorous relief as it is lewis john carlino and edward hume s limp script adapted from stanton forbes novel go to thy deathbed strands the viewer early on and only the charisma of the players gets us to the finish line from

i was permanently scarred by this terrible film the main action of the movie is nothing special it seems there s a tribe of snake worshipping people in a remote mountain region of northern china where women rather than men are the leaders and decision makers i suppose among some men this is enough to make succubare a horror movie anyway occasionally chinese men would wander into the village take a fancy to the local girls seduce them and then abandon them unfortunately for the men the women had put them under a spell derived from snake venom which would make them die horribly in days their bellies swollen like a pregnant woman s with live worms and snakes if they did not return forget the cover of the us video this has nothing to do with vampires though there is one inept blood drinking scene the title itself is only marginally appropriate succubare is the latin verb meaning to lie beneath and it s the root of the word succubus a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep actually it s the men who are the seducers here but it s not the main action of this ludicrous film that s so objectionable it s the little side incidents i ll overlook the slaughter and butchery of an ox that s performed on screen the participants seem very experienced as though this is an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life and i m sure they really ate the animal afterwards though i resent having the act thrust in my face as entertainment what i wish i could overlook or had overlooked are the numerous totally extraneous shots of an unidentified man who from time to time interrupts the story by eating living animals he starts the movie by tearing apart a live snake with his teeth in the course of the movie he devours a bug a lizard a toad i had to leave the room after this and a whole mouse i stopped watching at this point and lost my appetite for days let me stress that this was totally unexpected and had nothing to do with the movie unless it s a cynical reference to love as it s portrayed in the film a blind selfish predatory survival mechanism that tears apart the helpless but then again i m probably just rationalizing to get the vileness out of my head 
supercraptastic slasher fare which feels overly long at minutes years ago a bunch of gypsies who lived in the caves of a mountain were burned up in a forest fire years later campers are going missing from the area of the fire a bunch of horny kids are of course en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger jackson bostwick the kids troop up to the mountain any way before long the kids start to get picked off by the monster who remains unseen to the very end of the movie probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad no surprises to speak of they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates leaving the final girl to fend for herself although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster the story itself couldn t hold the weight of feature length so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here haphazardously as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release on the plus side the wildlife footage is rather nice also among the highlights are bostwick talking to a baby deer a decent rock climbing death sequence ok gore and the great jackie coogan in his final film role as the bumbling local sheriff this is a far cry from charlie chaplin but it was still nice to see him this is for slasher completists only 
out of the or so spaghetti westerns made this has got to be in the top twenty somewhere can not believe this hasn t received any reviews gemma is excellent in this van johnson is good too though his dubbed voice is a little off killter but that s the charm of the italian style beautiful photography and some excellently staged action all the supporting characters are well played the severity of the racist streak in the bad guys is pretty tough even by todays standards which creates an emotional depth to gemmas character in some of the situations that take place absolutely fantastic score by luis bacalov see this is in the wonderful wide screen dvd from japan a spaghetti must have 
a movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot the film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor s innermost feeling max who has lived in new york for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there comes back to paris and unexpectedly meets his ex girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well the three women max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations his fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see she gives him also no love but only stability true love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex girlfriend merely a fantasy for him to escape many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable the one who really animates max s life in fact is her best friend the equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because max has understand much more about his innermost feeling the nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated not equally ingenious as pulp fiction but things seem much more natural in the apartment max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to romane bohringer the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful a good commentary of today s love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 
while amiable and amusing for gay audiences frank oz s film in and out about a closeted gay teacher who has been outed on national television by a former student has been sanitized and deodorized to appeal to the larger and more profitable straight viewers that patronized the bird cage although audiences likely patted themselves on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film the movie revolves around kevin kline s howard brackett who is a grossly stereotyped gay man the movie asserts that a tendency to dance to disco music revel in barbra streisand movies and dress well indicates one s sexual orientation like queer eye the film actually takes a backhanded slap at straight men and stereotypes them as slovenly dim witted and lacking in taste and culture ok so in and out is only a comedy but even comedies send messages that can hurt unfortunately at the center of the film s humor lies a somewhat pathetic character howard is middle aged deeply closeted or in self denial and evidently has never had a sex life a three year engagement to a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets long talks and watching funny lady fortunately joan cusack plays howard s intended emily montgomery and she steals the show throughout most of the film s funniest moments belong to her although kline s attempts to resist dancing during an instruction tape on macho behavior are hilarious he is a gifted physical performer but the film gives him only few moments to shine matt dillon also stands out as the student turned actor and the clip from his oscar nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical however despite the movie s gay theme there is no boy meets boy romance and only one male to male kiss and that smooch is about as erotic as the one between michael and fredo corleone in godfather ii although well intentioned in and out fails to address the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates howard is fired from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and credentials yet little outrage is expressed most of the characters are more upset about the cancelled wedding than about howard s self realization which seems to take place overnight and his abrupt and unjust dismissal not surprisingly howard s parents endearingly portrayed by debbie reynolds and wilford brimley and his students rise to support him however the sugary finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it evidently was to howard brackett in the film the movie would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slob was a rabid fan of football drove a station wagon listened to country music and lived on fast food despite some good performances and funny situations in and out perpetuates stereotypes and whether they be positive or negative stereotypes should be consigned to the dustbin of social history 
when a movie s claim to fame is that martin sheen s younger less known brother stars in it you know it s not gonna be a real good one soultaker is a low budget silly film about a group of something year olds being pursued by an angel of death it s a stupid movie but it is pretty entertaining and even somehow slightly likable in it s stupidity the plot in the film is very small and it s stretched about as far as it possibly can be joe estevez isn t much of an actor so luckily for the audience he has very few lines and his role in mostly just him walking this movie really feels like it was trying to be a horror fantasy franchise considering it has the same plot layout as a slasher characters each dies one at a time will any live who really cares though it sounds like i hated this i didn t i just didn t like it very well but i was interested through most of it so i guess that counts for something my rating out of mins pg for language violence and nudity 
manna from heaven is a light comedy that uses exaggeration of human foibles to entertain the audience throughout the film there is the expectation that goodness will surface in each situation the result is that the movie goer finds himself herself sitting with this silly grin on his her face peace in his her heart and high expectations for human kind watching this movie was a most pleasant experience i would venture to say uplifting experience but some would say that sounds corny 
i will commend it in only one respect it was innovative innovative doesn t mean it s a good film it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films the simple plot is well simple i got to the point where i didn t care if they destroy the building or not if i had to hear that girl s annoying giggle one more time i swear i would hurl the dvd out the window and there s also the protagonist they try to make him lovable but he s a freakin pervert sniffing the girls bra sneaking peeks at her when she s naked putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps putting her bra on a blow up sex doll which she takes her panties off while hes asleep and slips them on his doll umm what irritates me even moreso is that crappy tinting in the photo gallery on the dvd you can see what the film looked liek before they greyscaled it and put in a color tint digitally too the film looked a lot better without the effect so they sacrificed it being a good film just to be artsy bah i could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap i think most people who liked this film just liked it because the chick was naked for a good minutes this doesn t compare to delicatessen like so many are tryign to do delicatessen has characters you can get into and like these people here just grunt and giggle lastly i would also liek to point out that this was also tryign to be like a german impressionistic film liek the old silents one of the problems with most foreign especially artsy films is that thety focus on making an artsy composition and forget about the space of the scene it results in the audience not really understanding what s going on because they don t get a sense of the space of the surroundings anyway it s rubbish the short film on the dvd surprise was a heckuva lot better 
the mere presence of sam waterston as an indian is enough to put this movie in the must see category he is both beautiful and very subtle with no lines whatsoever he is tender with his kidnappee and yet we can see he is among the proudest of all young indian men martin sheen is just a dumb cluck who decides to challenge waterston white bull for a gorgeous white horse other sub plots are really unnecessary i don t understand the part played by caroline langrishe as the poor girl who white bull kidnaps i don t know how she keeps her hands off this beautiful indian man it s a lot of fun though especially if you re a waterston fan man he looks good in this one harvey keitel s role isn t even worth mentioning to tell the truth but rent it and enjoy actually i do believe that if the music score was better it would ve been a more dramatic film the music is so bad it s distracting still there s mr waterston 
 grand is the cost of a new car a new car that jake west now needs to escape the hordes of angry villagers desperate for his blood some may say this film could attract so bad it s good status in my opinion it is the proud owner of the so bad it s bad label 
ever since i first played it in goldeneye has been one of my favourite video games in fact i recently bought an n purely so that i could own it and play it more often the game is pretty much near perfect the single player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in bond s shoes with varied mission objectives convincing weapons and great level design even though the enemies artificial intelligence is pretty basic by today s standards that only adds to goldeneye s appeal the method of obtaining cheats completing levels within a strict time limit was also innovative when the title was released and even now i still haven t cracked some of them the game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players and while this isn t as advanced as the combat simulator in the game s sequel perfect dark it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to smithereens with a barrage of rc p fire 
here we ve got an intelligent mixture of typical hongkongmovieshootouts worlddestructionthemes and intelligent filmmaking not that the script has not its big holes and a few specialeffects are a bit cheaplooking but the cinematography is a optical treat and the soundtrack is first rate the blend of fast actionsequences and colorful slow sometimes nearly poetic parts has no comparison in its kind of movie so a classification is rather hard the closest genre is a disaster or terroristmovie with deeper human and political notes than usual well worth to be seen worldwide in cinemas but i am hoping this for so many other mostly asian movies before and nobody seems to believe me unfortunately 
it is terrible it is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and and told them to make a film even then you d get a better and more professional film than this the story is so dumb you can say there isn t one i don t think the guy who made this knew what to do at all watching foreign art movies all day long isn t enough to make somebody an instant director the acting is very bad really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful the only scene i didn t hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film how do people get finance for this stuff i don t mind alternative films but shouldn t they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure i would call price of milk amateurish if it wasn t an insult to amateurs this would not even be a good film if you were drunk or drugged 
after watching this movie on a boring saturday afternoon i couldn t quite figure out why so many people liked it it wasn t heartwarming or clever it was merely an amalgam of every other mismatched people coming together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences learning something about each other movie ever made the characters are a stereotype bouillabaisse we have the blacks the hispanics the jews the asians and the homosexuals and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this to do the black mother declares that it s all right then when it s mentioned that another black character is at church instead of helping prepare dinner because all blacks love church the hispanics seem only capable of speaking spanish when the greet each other or make exclamations the lesbians do nothing but cuddle and kiss and one of them wears a bandanna because all lesbians dress like ani difranco and the vietnamese family owns a video store in l a imagine that oh and the movie is called what s cooking because each ethnic family cooks a different version of what they think thanksgiving dinner should be the black mother wants cornbread and macaroni and cheese the hispanics are shown rolling tortillas the vietnamese family is deep frying spring rolls i m surprised there wasn t a bottle of manischewitz on the jewish table this is all shown via the time honored tradition of the musical montage where they play the surfari s wipeout rapidly switching the instruments used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures isn t that cute anyway once the director is finished establishing how different everyone is he attempts to show the inner humanity that we as all people of every race religion and culture share by inventing implausible and overly dramatic conflicts for each of the families to deal with it would be a plot killer to mention what each of these conflicts are but rest assured that they are indeed surprises that is if you have been sleeping for the first half of the movie the theme of disgracing the family runs pretty strong throughout all in all if you re the type of person who enjoys those new fangled movies that revolve around the stories of unlikely characters intertwining well you still won t like this movie if you like extended montages of food being passed around a table then you need to put this in your netflix queue but if stereotypes and clich s are endearing to you then make sure you ask for this for christmas or hanukkah or kwanzaa 
i disagree with dante portraying the democrat supporting zombies as creatures with an average iq of i do believe their behaviour should reflect a lower iq than that something in the order of a pelosi iq a single digit figure please the moh series is quite uneven and this is the very worst episode dante yet another mindless hollywood liberal or an apolitical nerd who sucks up to the leftist establishment in order to re kindle his pitiful career must have finally realized that his directorial pursuits had been stuck in a low gear for nearly two decades now hence came up with this cringe inducing unsubtle left wing satire of the bush administration republicans and capitalism perhaps he felt he hadn t been overtly political before he wouldn t exactly be the first no talent to use asinine political propaganda to further his career when all else fails the maker of turds such as piranha the howling and matinee dante has been as useful a contributor to the horror genre as adolf hitler had been to world peace th uses lowest common denominator humour cheap and predictable gags which even the bluest of all blue collar union members wouldn t have trouble understanding or have you ever seen a clever subtle intelligent liberal satire populist manure has the basest of all messages hence the language and manner in which this message is communicated has to be as simple and basic as sean penn s name and what better people to send this message to the popcorn munching sheep than a couple of cocaine sniffing tinseltown losers who ve all fallen so low that they re forced to write for tv i don t want political propaganda either left or right in any type of movie but placing it in horror of all genres is a testament to the endless stupidity that reigns so supreme among hollywood s anti intelligentsia so vapid was dante that he even failed to notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote democrat that s what you get for finishing a movie school not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any stretch of the imagination 
there s lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel which piles on the naff visuals to no effect good old alan smithee directed this one in which various members of the same family all played poorly by bruce ramsay are terrorised by pinhead doug bradley wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time peter atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesn t seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick the incoherent plot fails to adequately fill the movie s meagre running time although this may have more to do with studio interference than anything the filmmakers intended 
danton was a hero and one of the founders of the french revolution of this movie is set five years later and the revolution has morphed into something ugly while initially the revolution promised freedom at this point the small committee running the country is extremely repressive and is a dictatorship danton and his friends were angry at how the country wasn t better off in than it was before they got rid of their king so they begin criticizing the government the movie begins as the printer who makes critical pamphlets concerning the government is beaten and his business is destroyed so much for liberty equality and fraternity so as a result of being silenced this way danton et al begin publicly criticizing the government eventually robespierre the leader of the committee and his cronies trump up charges have a show trial and get rid of the dissent some have mentioned that the polish director wajda also intended this to be a criticism of his own nation which at the time was soviet dominated and very repressive as well this makes sense as you see the movie unfold especially when the government destroys all dissent in the name of the people the acting is fine the story compelling and i have no major criticism of the film however i really wish the ending had been handled differently especially because other than history lovers and french people most probably have no idea that this execution helped to end the government after this purge of danton in april robespierre himself was executed in july because the country had just had enough plus those surviving frenchmen knew that they too would face the guillotine sooner or later if this sick system remained in place some sort of an epilogue would have been nice such as showing the soldiers coming for robespierre he responded by trying to kill himself first but he only succeeded in blowing off part of his face still alive he was guillotined shortly afterward this would have been a dandy little epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes however not showing a connection between danton s death and the fall of the government is an odd thing to omit 
i like steve buscemi i like his work very much both as an actor and a director you could say that i am into steve buscemi a steve buscemi freak i lurv steve buscemi i remember when i first saw buscemi s full length directorial debut trees lounge i enjoyed the movie although it wasn t as good as it could have been it was almost there it almost scratched that itch the itch of wanting to see small movies about small people in small bars that are in small towns it was close enough to where i would say that it was a very good movie one that with a few tweaks could have been great but that s ok i like the movie and i ve watched it more than once but this review is not about trees lounge it s about lonesome jim when i saw the description of the movie and then i saw who s movie it was i was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that i knew that trees lounge could have been but what i actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcohol induced impotence and headspinning regurgitation in other words this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that i wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning or if you happen to be the floozy waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile the film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich with store brand white bread no less and the emotion of a cadaver i am not sure what the point of this film was and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission sorta like those new cars that don t come with ashtrays anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars i m not one of them but hey i can sympathize overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film i mean trees lounge was about boring people doing boring things but it was interesting i blame a lot of this on affleck why do people keep casting these affleck turds they suck the life out of anything that they are connected with one affleck was in one decent film and wasn t even the reason why the film was decent and all of the sudden every butthole named affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can and liv tyler is no better being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress she is as lifeless as affleck these people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script people pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma these two duds together don t have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at wal mart i always thought that steve buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of pablum but oh steve you let us down this film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper 
i had the misfortune to watch this last night on the bbc i expect i may have been the only viewer from the beginning there was something quite wrong about the movie after a few minutes of viewing i managed to work out what it was the movie was bad not bad in a good way like wolfpack or a seagal film just plain old shoddy bad why was this made into a movie i ve seen a few episodes of the tv series and thought it was alright but i only saw repeats of that because they made this i spent most of the film trying to work out what the story was and by the end i was none the wiser i seem to remember at some point a character maybe farina s mentions that the mod squad can get in to places regular cops can t the place turns out to be a club one of the toughest places to get into maybe it was student night i lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was no plot and the movie was just chopped together from various leftovers from other tv series remakes was it an action comedy i don t remember any laughs overall this movie lacked the real scene stealing power of someone like seymour hoffman as the bad guy with him ribisi would have had somebody to bounce off 
the french babbette appears at the modest house of two danish sisters wet cold and alone fleeing revolution in paris she seeks refuge in an obscure religious community on the windswept jutland coast unbeknownst to those who so generously take her in she is a great chef an artist of food babette gives herself to her adopted community through thrift productivity and shared faith she leaves only when she wins the french lottery francs she returns laden with exotic cargo the makings of a single meal commemorating the birthday of the sister s father the community s founder this meal looms darkly in the minds of the pleasure denying faithful but its subtleties are translated by an aging military officer who as a young man in paris learned to appreciate the sensory experience unfolding here the meal is the film s climax a communion of love in the transitory artistry of food unaffectedly uplifting about art love and the meaning of life 
l appartement is i think a very purposeful hitchcockian film the plot was rife with symbolism ie the white and red roses and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly the look was very parisian and pulled you closer to the story i saw it in london and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states
watching this film today i got the feeling this thing was missing about to minutes or so from the beginning of the story john wayne rides up on this trading post saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies all he sees is the signs of a massacre some dead bodies signs of a fight and no one alive in sight that s because the owner s daughter is hidden in a secret room the kind you find in old english murder mysteries the reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes catholic families clinging to the old faith in th century england built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith not something you see in westerns but a good gimmick unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought wayne to this place exactly but this was a b western and not even a good one at that gabby hayes is in this and he s clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time an unusual circumstance for the garrulous gabby if you want to bother and find out what happens and see a whiskerless gabby hayes then see this film 
i watched this as part of a vampire movie marathon with research intent otherwise there is no way i d have watched it all the way through the first scene wherein a bunch of vampires in very bad wigs seemingly get electrocuted by various slow moving weapons wielded by an even slower moving van helsing wannabe in black and white with a voice over sets the pace for the entire rest of the film the fight scenes look ridiculous the dialouge would be funny if the acting wasn t so bad what passes for plot doesn t make sense and the production values bite from the pleather knock off of spike s coat worn by the hero to the cheesy cheap magician s cape their lead vamp swooshes around i ve seen some bad movies check out the magic sword with b rathbone or the raven with a very young jack n but this one gets my vote for worst of all times 
i am sitting here writing this review and the movie s not even over yet in fact i just checked and there are more minutes to go but no matter there s no need to see it through to the end i ll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which i don t care to ever see or know what accounts for my hostility to this movie the characters are not believable the plot is not believable the pretentiousness of the movie is sickening basically every element of the movie rings false buscemi obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of movies which have already explored the well worn themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent meaninglessness of life however buscemi was badly mistaken because this movie contains nothing new it tries very hard to be depressing but fortunately no one can really be depressed by it because it s obvious that no people like this exist in the entire world what is depressing however is the knowledge that somehow this film was voted several undeserved awards disgusting bottom line stay away from this worthless film at all costs 
also titled the magical castle this one is a stretch why bother why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake only some girlfriend of rockbart the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters not voices remain stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread next thing you know some bird will have memorized the forbidden arts and swan princess the magical bird will be born thankfully though the chapters are supposedly closed and this will beginning but bad ended trilogy will come to a close 
the true story of phoolan devi who became a national hero in india because she fought for her rights as a woman but in a violent manner i was surprised to see a powerful film with strong images come out of india instead of the bollywood art trash classics they churn out 
when the budget doesn t allow for a cadillac or packard or lincoln or imperial hearse we are talking cheep cheep that s bird language for cheap cheap what is in the hair of the forty year old teen boy the guy who looks like a cement head who tries a couple of times to run over john agar and provides the only scare in the movie by how close he comes his hair looks like a shoe a patent leather shoe he is a shoe head the nurse woman needs immediate emergency hair washing she has lacquer in her blond locks that would ignite if the production company had been able to afford lights the monster the music was scarier i would try to run from the music the monster probably had better hair than the rest of the cast put some lipstick on that monster and you ve got divine s older sister the camera work and editing and plot provided a buffer to prepare the audience for the bad music throughout hello mr agar we re thinking of doing a sequel to night fright and mr agar agar tom willett
cuba gooding jr and ed harris are touching this movie is really surprising it was enjoyable from start to finish the story is about mentally challenged man who helps out with a football team 
this is the question that astronauts roy thinnes and ian hendry ask themselves when they discover a parallel world of earth always hidden on the far side of the sun in this cult science fiction melodrama released here in america as journey to the far side of the sun the plot of the film was devised by british writers gerry and sylvia anderson the creators of such tv shows as ufo the thunderbirds and space it is exceedingly weird at times betraying the influence of the twilight zone and even stanley kubrick s classic a space odyssey the visual effects work of derek meddings who would also later work on superman the movie holds up surprisingly well under the last three decades of special effects advancements and while they are not really on the same exalted level of the kubrick film they are very superb if you don t anticipate a star wars type of a film and can overcome the occasionally trite dialogue doppelganger is a good film it was good enough for me to rank it a and consider it an undiscovered sci fi gem 
plodding maybe that should have been the title bad dialogue delivered at a snail s pace all the characters are single dimension with the exception of one unfortunately that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this clich ridden two hour drag having grown up in the seventies this film is seriously lacking in detail atmosphere and authenticity surprisingly this was produced by kelsey grammar someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script cameron richardson is about the only element that lights up this film robin trower s music is also a welcomed addition 
i knew this was headed for disaster after looking at the clock within minutes of air time the story line two people get married they move into the wife s parents home and husband doesn t get along with father in law and if you haven t seen this plot before you probably have not watched tv for the last years or so 
after i saw la pianiste several years ago i said to myself that i would never see it again so powerful and disturbing it was time went on but i could not get the movie and its main character erika kahut out of my mind the story of a respected piano teacher in vienna conservatory cool and collected on the surface an expert in classical music with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear self loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing i read the book the piano teacher by elfriede jelinek the controversial nobel prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it i saw the film again second time all pieces of puzzle came to the right places not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as le pianiste three actors gave outstanding performances franz schubert s piano music soaked in the morbid humanity is another bright star of the movie i only have one problem with haneke s vision there is a scene in the film where haneke made some changes to erika s character comparing to the novel in the book the furthest she went to reveal herself to walter the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her was in a letter as soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that she had stopped communicating with him erika of the book would never chase walter to throw herself to him she kept everything inside she did not like to act she was not a chaser she loved to watch the big scene during the hockey game was not necessary it tried to make erika sympathetic and of course huppert was heartbreaking but it took the mystery that surrounded her jelinek did not write that scene it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film 
the trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre setting it in the old west except it s not the real old west of course it s some sort of future west in a world where some apocalypse has as apocalypses are known to do killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies it s zombie virus time again folks and you know what that means get bitten and become one of them so into this dusty and dead filled world comes a hero he s a bounty hunter getting paid for taking care of zombies it s not exactly clear who is providing the funds but it seems a little cottage industry of zombie hunting has emerged but as the trailer tells us there s a problem they are running out of zombies the only way to keep on earning is to infect new towns and cities with the virus i think that s not a bad idea for a film but unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people pawing at windows to make a good zombie film what we actually get is a clint eastwood clone the actor s even called clint for crying out loud and his hilarious sidekick trying to bag zombies while trailing some still living bad guys to get some big reward the whole subplot about infecting other towns is only mentioned in passing over half way through the film instead there s a lot of western movie clich s poor zombie make up and some world class bad acting really bad the sort that wouldn t even make it onto hollyoaks both hero and villain chomp on cigars quips are thrown people get bitten as the movie lurches to a conclusion the only thing worth wondering is whether it s going to end with the clich of the hero being the only man alive having killed the one he loves or the clich of him turning into a zombie in the final frame it s the first one by the way this film was written and directed by gerald nott it s the only thing he has done and hopefully it will be his last at the start of the film there is a caption that reads nott entertainment at least they got one thing right 
a thinly veiled attempt to push hulkamania to the film going non wrestling fan what could be worse than hogan in the movies bad actors in the wrestling ring and this film produced both as tiny lester made his way to the wwe that summer in the mother of all promotional blunders see the dictionary under oops as a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when i came out i immediately checked into h a hulkamaniacs annoynimous i am proud to say i have been off the hulk for years now and have never had a craving since since this was made to bring in more fans to the juggernaut that was the wwe in hogans hey day one has to wonder if there weren t more fans like me who turned to other past times that did not poison ones mind like this offense to celluloid did such as huffing gas or russian roulette 
it s a unique film as it gives us our only chance to see the young noel coward in all his ironic glory because he seems so reserved detached he s perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter of factly uses all those around him however in the deadly serious no pun intended last act when coward must make like the flying dutchman he s much less comfortable but his way with an epigram is peerless and hecht macarthur have given him some gems macarthur really he was the wit of the pair the film is superbly lighted by the great lee garmes but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence hecht and macarthutr cared about one thing getting their dialogue on screen note h m themselves have blink and you ll miss em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene the most notable supporting player is the one and only alexander woolcott notorious broadway columnist and close friend of both macarthur and coward who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher coward curious that woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary algonquin round table of which he was a founder and macarthur something of an auxiliary member the scoundrel actually won an oscar for best story though that victory is probably due more to coward s imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot it s coward woolcott and the dialogue you remember 
there is no reason to watch this film why many reasons first up the acting is awful there is hardly a line that isn t misread but that is hardly surprising given the banality stupidity and repetitiveness of the dialogue the actors are asked to mouth it is awfully written one of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way of keeping their characters talking after a certain point and that is to have them repeat the most important words of the previous character s line repeat yes they repeat it for the whole movie the whole movie yes the whole movie etc in movies like this you generally know who the bad guys are and what they are after all the good guys usually have to do is stop the bad guys setting up a good mwahahaha with x in my grasp i will rule the universe villain is the first stop in any cheapo sf plot but in this turkey you tell me as i understand it our heros are a bunch of mass murderers sent into the past on a dirty dozen type mission they are sent by a fascistic totalitarian state to stop some other mass murderers from altering the course of history the new history would not include the rise of totalitarianism and a war that kills billion people and leaves the earth a dead planet we know all this because this movie has one of those handy long on screen situation reports just before the action starts telling you who is who and what is what it s an indication of who the producers think their target audience will be that it is narrated as well as appearing on screen just to save the audience from taxing their brains too much by doing a lot of reading so just who are we supposed to be rooting for here i guess we are asked to believe our hero undertakes some sort of journey from totalitarianism to love peace and understanding while shooting loads of people but that doesn t work as an arc because we are shown he is a decent ish human being right at the start when he tries to rescue all the civilians aboard the rebel station i guess the makers were aiming at some sort of deeper than normal complexity in this film but they just ended up with an unholy mess with more plot holes and logical inconsistencies than a dozen or so of your average crap sf movies the opening credits were nice 
this is one of the best movies on the french revolution ever produced being a person well versed in the the period i was amazed at the level of detail the costumes are spot on even the detailed little day to day items such as ink wells serving plates etc are all perfect as an american living in france who has access to the sites in the movie through his membership in various historical associations such as the napoleonic alliance i can not over state how impressed i was with the visual accuracy of the film the dialogue where known is virtual quotations and the where not recorded is in character i was extremely pleased with this movie and am disappointed that it is not out on dvd yet this is how historical drama should be done must see 
as if the world needed another seagal movie add a bunch of actors who well are not really actors a bunch of heavy metal music to compliment the rap and of course a hot looking crazy chick in leather with no hips and we prevent ourselves from being half past budget why oh why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films fbi capture two buddies and send them to new alcatraz where the prison s first inmate to be executed has unexpected guests first rate acting all around particularly any scene involving tragedy for the good guys seriously though the director did try and pulled a modern hard edge for the movie the best he could be he went to the well too often and half past dead gets boring too soon what else can you do when the inmates just hang around talking while the hostages continually ask what makes the main bad guy motivated a mindless action flick that amounts to little if not a ight 
barbara stanwyck probably didn t think of it but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle if it wasn t a wig than the one she had to wear in double indemnity the year before that film while the premiere film noir and an all around great film gave her a great role but oh that hair here she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal but she is certainly a s woman she has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war and as a successful martha stewart like columnist she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is we meet her boss sydney greenstreet who has no idea that she is living a lie and when he pushes his way in for a christmas away at her supposed connecticut home she has to come up with a husband reginald gardiner and baby before we can say jingle bells hungarian chef s z sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one on one with irish una o connor it s not goulash it s irish stew sakall simply takes the paprika pours most of it in and says now it s goulash totally changing what she has prepared for lunch then when it comes to the flapjacks he flips and she scoops for years a few friends of mine and i will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation i don t flip i scoop she won t even flip just one for greenstreet saying i ve never flipped in me life o connor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films but here she is delightfully lovable and her pairing with sakall is very charming it is obvious in the romance department that reginald gardiner is not barbara stanwyck s cup of tea especially when she meets handsome dennis morgan who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby which eats soap causing stanwyck to get a bit alarmed he should suspect something instantly but doesn t but it doesn t matter the film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow an abundance of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up living in new york city after years in los angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of new york state made me miss this kind of christmas while central park is beautiful after a first snow and the christmas tree at rockefeller center is exsquisit too there is something about looking out at a snow covered field of trees and catch an occasional glimpse of deer rabbits or other wild life this is a great holiday film that can also bring on the christmas spirit out of season and makes a great pairing with another barbara stanwyck country christmas film remember the night an underrated gem add on the big city christmas of meet john doe and you ve found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around 
brilliant work marvelous actors dissolve as brave and courageous characters all unforgettable parts in a more than intriguing and capturing action thriller the casting is perfect both from the side of the stars like armand asante bernhardt kier denier but as well for new faces i was very impressed by the young actor who plays the boy gang member mustafa you trust each one from the turkish gang very convincing is michael barral and all white power followers i admire the music beat of the main theme of children of wax this sound track is a charming mixture of turkish hard rock and udo kier s humming and in the same time children of wax a tale focusing on racial conflicts the intolerance and brutality between the skinheads and the turks 
when a movie called hell ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker clich with character names like pistolero comanche and the gent i braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that the dialogue soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while cc rider plays and they talk about sex and violence yawn the three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable seeing old men like bishop and madsen in a freaking ruffled shirt riding down a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men trying desperately to relive their youth poor eric balfour tried his best but with such poor material it got lost even an appearance by dennis hopper in full easy rider swing couldn t save it and let s talk about the store bought tans shall we many have compared this to tarantino s work it is not even close what makes tarantino s work so brilliant is he knows it s over the top so he just goes balls out and takes it as far over the top as possible bishop took this film so seriously that it became nothing more than a poor copy of the exploitation genre 
thank god i didn t buy this movie myself i borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed this has got to be one of the worse movies i ve ever seen i do realize they couldn t have had much of a budget but i swear i could make a better movie than this staring my pets the acting was horrible so was the editing the dialogue everything it was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as i watched it i m looking forward to the real movie about this story coming out soon so that people curious about it don t have to stoop to watch this joke 
although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about custer the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best 
this movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me everything i hate about films is present fake sentimentality extreme corniness bad child actors and more feature abundantly that s ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of american sports fans with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon what that s a rugby ball the story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like who coincidently teaches the class in a short skirt and gets them interested in football naturally they re all rubbish don t forget they re no hopers except for one kid who has moved from el paso blah blah etc etc and the kids still don t become good footballers but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well rounded kids hell even the adults start to come round drunks are turned into caring parents illegal immigrants are let off the hook groan this movie stars steve guttenberg now before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy hold up a minute guttenberg is rubbish no no come on let s face it how did this guy ever get to be in a movie i have absolutely no idea and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea olivia d abo stars along side steve and doesn t impress either she merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it although i have no problems with the latter part her performance does the movie no credit the child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this most of them are disgusting and or annoying and it doesn t make for pleasant viewing at all there s a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job but you wouldn t see a movie for a goat so don t bother seeing this movie 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was it tells the story of custer played by errol flynn during and after his graduation from westpoint although i ve heard that the film isn t very historically accurate hollywood never is i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp arthur kennedy rode to their deaths on little big horn i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child but it wasn t until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was i ll give this film out of 
clive barker of hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting the make up done by bob keen and geoffrey portass was fantastic it took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground it was really a treat to see the quality of work it wasn t particularly horrible as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer i just saw craig sheffer in shadow of doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also nothing spectacular but fair this was only anne bobby s third film and she was good also the ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts as did david cronenberg ha 
i consider myself lucky that i got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors kramer vs kramer was great to me because i think i could relate to it unfortunately my parents are divorced even though i was older than billy in this movie i felt his pain and confusion having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst through this movie actually i think it made me realize that my parents are people too and they had as just much pain as my sister and i had back to the movie this was a good one yes it s dated and meryl and dustin are very young but i would recommend this for a lot of people because i think most can relate in some way there are funny sad happy and relieving moments that are carried away terrificly by these great actors it s a good movie and deserves more credit than a 
the story line of a man s love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self centered valley girl who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of there lives what a great and worthy story line but in this telling the screen writing and or directing and or editing is so poor as to take most of the joy out of the story linda hamilton s character goes from understanding mom to wicked witch and back faster than a speeding bullet and for what purpose conflict conflict conflict at the drop of a hat katie the california girl and her boyfriend katie s mom and everybody including the poor lady at the airport check in counter lin s adopted father who is the nicest most considerate man alive and his wife and biological son all in constant conflict i really wanted to enjoy a heartwarming story but the only thing that made me smile was when all the hate and fighting were over there were too many unexplained or illogical events many of which don t add to the story my wife and i kept looking at each other and asking ourselves how such a good cast and what should be a great story could be crapped up so badly 
i enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera i think it s a little bit influenced by the brazilian movie city of god but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow crime and art in social neighborhood are a reality i think the films made by madiba are really beautiful i don t think it s unreal that he shoot such good films because there s a lot of artists that don t have any type of education and can be really genius i enjoyed very much the soundtrack it s adjusted to the pictures see the movie it s good to show how can be a life in a social neighborhood 
i saw bandit queen in over a decade after it was made amidst widespread controversy in india the language the stark treatment and the natural acting by a relatively unknown cast for that time might have been even more shocking at that time for an indian populace more familiar with fantasy cinema the film the cast and shekhar kapoor deserve accolades for the breakthrough effort the plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in india in fact there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself the reason why this stands out is that it s supposed to be a first person account of someone who actually went through all this and a lot else that doesn t find place on the screen and survived to tell the tale survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least phoolan devi didn t live very long after being released from prison in the film scores on several counts the cinematography is brilliant the music is apt the cast many of whom became more familiar names later is very good but the screenplay is patchy things move too fast and in jerks at times it s understandable though because there are just too many strands that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive or maybe i felt that because i have read mala sen s book which is a more detailed and better though obviously not as shocking as the visual account of phoolan devi s travails and which is purported to be one of the main sources for the film there are some factual ambiguities too according to phoolan devi she wasn t present when the behmai massacre took place and despite claiming to be the dictated account of phoolan herself she is shown to participate and in fact initiate the massacre then the final scene where phoolan surrenders shows her touching the feet of the chief minister while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of mahatma gandhi symbolic value only but shows that phoolan didn t want to show servitude to a living ordinary person it would have been nice to show the chief minister to have some resemblance to arjun singh who many remember was the cm of madhya pradesh then but these are small chinks in this eminently well made movie a rare gem to come out from the mainstream indian film industry made by a man who before this was known best for the ultimate masala movie of the late s mr india 
whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the th century libby and george were married for years until the little big horn what s not known to today s audience is that libby survived until during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing but if done from libby s point of view they could be understood and forgiven sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer he was retired and replaced by george b mcclellan in late while custer was still at west point i m not sure they ever met but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema errol flynn and olivia dehavilland this was the last of eight films they did together the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libby s farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign both their performances olivia s especially was a high point in their careers at warner brothers we know through history that custer is riding to his doom that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy if your eyes don t moisten you are made of marble as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action you can t beat this film at all 
my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger it s about andre a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter katharine heigl on a vacation hoping to get a little closer to her but of course nicole isn t that easy to get along with she just started puberty i m guessing she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time one day at the beach nicole meets handsome ben and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie i would give my father the hero 
i m not a movie snob i ve liked lots of movies that critics hate and i ve hated movies that critics love however i have to agree with critics here galaxina is just substandard clearly intended to be a comedy it only has a few scattered laughs galaxina has poor photography it has poor special effects it has some pretty poor acting and the production values well the sets might as well have been made of cardboard galaxina tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called the blue star after a long voyage and some very unconvincing space battles the crew arrives at its destination a sort of wild west alien world there s a painfully unfunny cantina scene clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous star wars scene a chase involving space bikers and a final getaway the cast tries but can t breathe life into this turkey stephen macht and avery schreiber have done better work in other movies james david hinton is pretty good as a member of the spaceship s crew the late dorothy stratten stars as the robot of title and while she looks great her role doesn t give her much of a chance to act you might catch this film to see dorothy stratten however if you re looking for a good movie you ll probably want to skip this one 
if you go into the twins effect looking for a pure hong kong movie experience you will be disappointed this is not to say it is bad but it is not a traditional hong kong action movie running in a similar vein to shaolin soccer and kung fu hustle it s resolutely silly and juvenile so if you want a good bit of serious hong kong action look to a john woo or yuen woo ping movie this movie s got a lot of flak for it s silliness and i thought the first thing i should do would be to explain what you re getting into as it s disappointed a lot of purists for the non purists and those with more forgiving tastes though twins effect is a delightfully silly kung fu comedy i liked it a lot for a variety of reasons not least it s wonderful female leads who spark off each other in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act i believe this is the first movie of it s type they ve been in but they hop kick and fly about like seasoned pros the patently ridiculous plot is handled with a great deal of care and attention and the movie is quite knowingly written making a lot of the movie laugh out loud the comedy really is the most prominent thing here and it s a subtle gentle comedy as reliant on words as inanimate objects going flying a la stephen chow it has to be said the slapstick is immense fun too the sequence with the disco dancing vampires is a total classic the action is a blend of two genres really it falls between the period drama wire and sword fighting which comes in more toward the end and the comedy fighting style of jackie chan coming out with a blend that though a little derivative at times is always exciting to watch and occasionally throws up some genuinely innovative encounters all this is great and the movie is tremendous fun all the way through despite this it does have a few sticking points for instance twins effect is in many ways much more westernised than kung fu fans are perhaps used to the inevitable comparison to the blade series is definitely sound as an example though twins effect is honestly much better than blade ever managed especially for fighting action personally it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent anthony wong the hissable villain from john woo s classic hard boiled so underused but the younger audience this is aimed at are unlikely to notice this or indeed know about hard boiled or his other movies so this is only really a personal gripe if you watch this with an open mind you ll probably enjoy it greatly like i did but you must be firmly aware it is a comedy not a balls to the wall kung fu movie keep that in mind and you ll be fine 
here s another of the s westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or fmc because although it may be flawed historically it is extremely entertaining and well acted plus it s got randolph scott my favorite actor second only to gary cooper well ok fourth behind coop charlton heston and gregory peck but the film itself to me anyway is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before well acted and flows very well i bet i ve seen it or times and enjoy each viewing more than the one before i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd see it if you haven t i guarantee you ll like it 
first of all i have nothing against christianity i believe every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses but i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this what a waste of believers money they d better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries i don t want to talk about talk acting or plot of this movie because i couldn t find any of those in this story s simple two reporters one a is atheist the other b for some sake has abandoned religion b regains his confidence in religion and teaches a a lesson believe in christ or go to hell this message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie people do not believe the rating of this movie read reviews first i didn t and wasted an hour of my life ps why is it classified as sci fi because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky pps u f o satan s evil doings that s a new one 
whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film making it s thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever if you re depressed already this film will send you over the edge if you re feeling somewhat depressed this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about you ll feel that it s just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed i didn t btw safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than jim s then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you d previously realized you might feel a bit annoyed at jim for bringing this to your attention you may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish the sad truth is much as i wanted to like this movie i hated it it took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly for no reason whatsoever looked back at itself and then stopped jim does not have an epiphany at least not one that is conveyed on screen jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options he discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self discovery of course no one alive could write a happy ending to this movie as others have said it s no hollywood tale it s gritty and it s real it s well made life is quite a struggle at times if anyone were to know the answer they do well to shout it from the rooftops still i feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say you feel that it s going to say something that if you just suffer through a little more of it it ll have something to say it ll make you stop and think it doesn t again i do submit that this is a well crafted film and therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e g lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes for the rest of us it s utterly miss able 
went to the premiere at the tribeca film festival in nyc and i absolutely loved the film i am diane s biggest fan and of course as always she gave a magnificent performance i have seen every single one of her movies and i must say that this is one of my new favorites diane was funny and moving and just took my breath away donald sutherland was surprisingly humorous but also a good amount of serious anton yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and gave an amazing performance all in all i recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate an excellent movie thumbs up i would definitely go see it again and again and again this is the best film of the year so far 
being a huge fan of conte d ete http www imdb com title tt i was expecting to be wowed by another french beach romance with a lot of honesty realism and humor same director same actress what could go wrong unfortunately pauline a la plange is a huge disappointment it s very slow and talkative which would be fine if the dialog conveyed insights into the characters was meaningful or original but it comes across as a typical soap opera alternating between irrelevant pillow talk and jealous accusations the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least character change with regards to pauline the source material is standard fare sexual awakening during a beach vacation but it could have been a decent film nevertheless if any of the characters were sufficiently interesting unfortunately that s not the case event though there are other shortcomings with rohmer s season cycle most of his later films are definitely leagues above this one 
marigold is by far the best outsider s take on bollywood i have ever seen i didn t grow up with bollywood but i ve seen a few hundred of them now i d say it leaves gurinder chadha mira nair and even merchant and ivory of bombay talkie almost in the dust willard carroll the director really loves bollywood and he has the self confidence to allow us to know it there s humor but no arch ironic distancing no of course i don t really mean this stuff as jerry lee lewis would say he gets it and so he can let us have it too the joy of a bollywood movie experience along with touches that are supplied by a westerner s stepping into the story teller s role it s a story about a caustic bitchy beautiful american b movie actress she s only been in movies with numbers in their titles like fatal attraction who finds herself in a different bollywood movie from the one she went to india to be in kama sutra has folded its tents while she was en route apparently because its producers are now in jail salman khan in real life a bollywood mega mega star is the dancing master of the delightful written on the fly movie she has now been pulled into is this before or after i go blind and through the sweetness of his mildly psychically gifted character she learns more than how to find her inner ecstatic dancing ability the strong beginning gives you both bollywood a super energetic troupe of dancers in front of the taj mahal both funny an familiar to the western viewer as well as providing the high velocity musical thrill we love in a hindi movie and salman on screen from the outset no bollywood minute wait for the hero he has on an indian costume embellished with kit carson style western movie fringe all in white ali larter s actress character is pleasing to the western viewer she s blonde which is traditional for a white person in a bollywood movie and visually understandable casting but she s a robust girl not the ethereal kind of blondie we re usually presented with and she s a more or less three dimensional total bitch carrying on profane and abusive cell phone conversations with a boyfriend and agent in the us we also have scenes of women who are having problems with each other going out to a bar to deal with them the capacity for people not getting along to relate and have emotional conversations is traditional in hindi movies but we seldom see much of any such thing going on between women other than the discussion between mother and daughter about the daughter s choice of groom let alone strangers unrelated people let alone bar going so the spirit is the same the details are fresh and i was completely delighted by this i only saw it once at a preview showing attended by the director a fine speaker and question answerer he and salman got to be brother like good friends over the making of it he loves india he has plans to make a wizard of oz movie in india i can t get too detailed about songs when i ve seen them just once except to say i liked them all they range from a happy parody of the bollywood number in the movie within the movie the ladies costumes with leghorn hats and seashell cased bodices it s a beach scene on flowy dresses are worth the cost of a ticket alone to a lovely reflective many scened romantic song in a sadder and more serious part of the movie mix of hindi and english in the music and it works salman khan gets a lot of credit from me for openness to unusual projects this and jaan e mann and good judgment about which ones to be in carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas all along the way and totally fine i e not narcissistic at all whether carroll accepted or rejected them clearly just a pro who loves being involved and collaborating 
dorothy stratten is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci fi spoof and her appearance is a disappointment though she has the title role her screentime is limited and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue if you re not a stratten fan pass this one up 
this movie has got to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst one i ve ever seen it wasn t even a bad b movie i would have rated it at as a z the special effects were ridiculous err if you could even call them special effects i think the reviewer before hit the nail on the head it was the box that sold the movie while the cover art was great and the synopsis intriguing which both is why i rented it it was a waste of not only time but money as well i didn t last long i took it back to the store and switched it out for another movie i believe my local video store took it off the shelf because they had soooo many complaints about this horrible movie my year old could have done a better job filming it writing the script 
dr sayer philippe leroy a wealthy physician with psychological issues regarding the opposite sex kidnaps an employee maria dagmar lassander a free thinking liberal woman who believes men must be the ones fixed instead of females sayer retreats to his palatial estate running maria through a humiliating series of mind games threatening to molest and kill her sayer s desire it seems is to dominate her body mind and soul making her his sexual slave obeying his commands adhering to his every wish and whim after resistance at first maria slowly teeters towards his objective but has plans of her own she says she wishes to help sayer relinquish his sadistic behavior towards women so that he could love and not feel such yearning desires to harm it seems that sayer has her under his grip agreeing to certain rather embarrassing scenarios such as lotioning his toes making love to a blow up doll which is a recreation of himself often spending time topless and even getting hosed down when she slaps him hard across the face bringing blood from his nose which almost break her but something happens as the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with maria and through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness maria gains an upper hand toying with sayer s lust for her body more of a battle of wills a kind of sexual warfare where it seems one is in charge when in fact the other truly has the upper hand through a great deal of the film sayer mistreats maria forcing her it seems to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well designed fortress it s a typical european art deco kind of palace fashioned and orchestrated by a man who has kept to this weekend retreat of his for quite a spell it features walls and doors opening at his command with an area quarantined off for his victims but once maria seemingly downs a bottle of pills as a result of her anguish at his hands the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him he finds that he actually craves her and maria uses this to her advantage playing hard to get when sayer wishes to embrace and ravage her and i could understand his frustration because she has this allure that can drive a man crazy i felt the film works ultimately as a war cry for women their empowerment and uprising against men who have the notion that they should always have control sexually and mentally the twist finalizes this ideal i couldn t swallow sayer s fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen we see how he develops his toned athletic figure and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin if he is so well fit and spends such time developing himself for the extracurricular activities which follow his regimen how could he suffer the fate which follows his finalizing the deal with maria at the end when she stops resisting his advances maria he would later admit is the first he s actually kidnapped others from the past call girls were paid for their services so that sayer could feel the power of dominating a woman even if it s all a fictitious charade brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex the spontaneous decision to do so to take a leap from the norm costs him more than he could ever know all this psycho sexual sub text is rather fascinating to see unravel but dagmar lassander such a yummy sex kitten was my reason for enjoying it so without her i couldn t have liked it as much because she s vital as a victim worth striving to obtain perhaps the film s highlight the delicious dance as lassander clothed in gauze unravels the wardrobe exposing her breasts to a jazzy score it s the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and forehead sweat dagmar lassander must ve been a joy for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so well she has this kind of cool a sophistication and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers dagmar transcends the part to create an iconic character which would define her career even if the film isn t well known i found about through word of mouth the provocative nature of the script and risqu subject matter might not appeal to certain crowds as it deals with sex and pain in many different forms the dialogue quite illustrative and elaborative at times i couldn t help but chuckle at sayer s comments towards an imprisoned maria regarding how he enjoys making women suffer and the thrill he gets at forcing them into a type of slavery in an attempt to make the words poetic it all feels rather hokey but dagmar is the real reason to see it and the film to me works at it s best as a fetish film a possible male fantasy with this seemingly prim and proper idealist captured and held against her will forced into a precarious situation her fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist her submission and how she reacts towards his aggressive behavior with her there are times where she unfolds to a wavering desire to embrace him unveiling a possible attraction towards him which in itself might startle some who watch it are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature my other favorite scene besides the dance is the piano concerto with sayer fondling maria as she plays a soothing melody 
kevin kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the comedy in out kline plays howard brackett a small town history teacher who excitedly sits down to watch the academy awards this year because one of his former students matt dillon is a nominee he is nominated for his performance in a film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins he thanks howard in his speech for inspiring him because howard is gay now this floors howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television howard is even engaged to be married to joan cusack in an oscar nominated performance so he has no idea where dillon s cameron drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he has to defend himself to everyone at school but is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what cameron said on the oscars howard has a birthday party where he is given birthday presents like the soundtrack to yentl and ends up explaining to his guests why barbra streisand had to make funny lady his parents wilford brimley debbie reynolds are shocked but promise to support their son even if he is gay he also gets a visit from an out of town reporter tom selleck who wants to do an article about him because he s gay too the moment when selleck plants a big kiss right on kline s lips is a classic but all of these little things have howard actually questioning his sexuality and wondering if he really is gay much to the aggravation and frustration of his fianc e cusack who is beyond confused the scene where she leaves a bar in her wedding gown and stands in the middle of street screaming about the lack of single straight men in the world is a classic but what i like about this movie is the way kline fully invests in the role and was not afraid to look foolish or look gay there is a fabulous scene probably the most famous from the film where he buys a record on how to be macho and the guy on the record is talking about how real men don t dance and a disco tune comes on i will survive if memory serves and the narrator on the record says no matter what you do don t dance but howard can t help himself and he ends up shaking his groove thing all over the room it s hysterically funny and kline plays it with sincerity and gusto the film is not pro or anti gay it s just a deft and amusing character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is wonderful film 
if you find the first minutes of this film to be so slow that you wonder why you re watching it don t give up also hearing the danish language is a bit new to most north americans who don t see and hear a lot of danish films anyway as the film progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his her patience being a fan of the movie out of africa this film piqued my interest because it s based on a short novel by isak dinesen karen blixen the major character in that film the meal babette s feast was amazing i m no chef but i was impressed how one interprets the story too varies i suppose depending on how much you read into this and where you stand religion wise if the latter how you look at the definition of legalism can affect how you interpret this story in any case it s a fine film but don t watch this if you re dieting 
the movie begins almost achingly slowly a romance yawn that seems to ramble off course all part of the plan then roughly one hour into this solemn movie is the feast it s worth paying attention to that first hour the feast is still solemn but humorous suddenly the withdrawn and slightly petty characters come to life and everyone you and the characters leave feeling enriched by the experience women will love this christians of all sorts will enjoy the profound faith demonstrated by the characters not my favorite movie of all time no dinosaurs or laser beams after all but definitely a movie i am happy to have seen not to be missed jim
on first viewing this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten however viewed strictly within the context of the story the implication is that to survive in the immediate post civil war america one had to have a horse and not any old horse but a truly great one and eagle s wing is such a horse but for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter who should own it the native american or the awol soldier the story throughout pits primitivism against civilisation as has been said by other commentators it is ironic that it took an english director to perceive this fact and then develop this simple theme into a western like no other you re ever likely to see again the film is basically about this beast and the savage harshness of the environment and the people who scrape a living from it the photography and the soundtrack are exquisite martin sheen s performance is a revelation this film released in the same year as sheen s other great performance as willard in apocalypse now hints at his abilities which somehow were never given such a free rein again more s the pity a comparison of the two stories throws up the surprising similarities between them not least that both films chart a man s journey into his soul in order to find redemption whereas willard is redeemed i will leave it to the viewer to decide if pike is eventually the ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving be warned altogether this is an extraordinary film 
i absolutely love this movie i just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch on my birthday this movie brings up several questions one is who are the monsters of this world to be different is just that different the real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness they are those that everyone considers a nice quiet bloke who didn t bother anybody or they are worse they are the characters such as played by croneberg men who draw pleasure and power from carving up people and creating their own books of blood i love the shapeshifters people with gifts and those that may be abhorent for people to look upon this movie touches on and explores what is normal who are other and what fear does to some even though i gave this movie i am still sick of women who either scream or are so set in their ways that they cant see what is happening and being a vehicle for the things that destroyed median my other complaint was why didn t they ever make a second film i for one would have loved to see a continuation of this most intriguing story that keep me captivated from beginning to end
historical drama is one of the areas where the british just can t be beat so while i m not a huge fan of the genre i can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it s british and with decent actors i have never read anything by sarah waters which is of course something i should do hence i didn t really know what to expect from this i had heard that there would be a lesbian love story but not much more while watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well crafted although there were almost a twist too many somewhere it took me a minute to get everything straight production values are good the actors are very solid and the pace is decent although i found it to be a bit slow in the last half hour that might just be me though i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished all in all though this is a fairly enjoyable three hours i recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas 
i guess those who have been in a one sided relationship of some sort before will be able identify with the lead character minako yuko tanaka a year old woman who is still in the pink of good health as demonstrated by her daily grinding routine of waking up extremely early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery work where she has to lug bottles of megmilk in a bag in a route around her town like clockwork to exchange empty bottles for full ones and to collect payment and issue receipt and there s always be that one delivery stop that s right at the top needing to scale a long flight of stairs in order to achieve customer satisfaction and peculiar enough that stop happened to be a stop delivering to a man with whom she has been in love with for almost all her teenage to adult life and not having the product appreciated but poured down the sink having gone to the same school we see that they re not talking to each other and in their daily life always seem so close physically but yet so far away there s no eye contact save for cursory glances by chance and little acknowledgement of each other s existence we learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all notions of being together where clear attraction between the two was hampered from developing further by the earlier generation while i thought minako was an interesting woman in herself one who has kept her feelings suppressed for so long one can only wonder what kind of damage it would do if i read that the original japanese title means at some time the days you read books and it s accurate i felt the movie had a wonderful finale with that shot of her well stocked bookcase likely alluding to the fact that she s not alone after all and had probably fallen back on her crutch of sorts to deal with the pain of being alone and back to a lifestyle which she had already been accustomed to for years besides immersing herself in two jobs she has those books which serve as a form of escapism and occasionally pens little sweet nothings to song dedication shows on the radio yuko tanaka did a commendable job as the emotionally strong woman resigned to her fate and her decision to love none other her object of affection takanashi ittoku kishibe was a more interesting character who has more facets staying true to marriage vows he spends significant amount of screen time looking after his sickly bedridden wife played by akiko nishina while juggling with his job of social welfare in the children s affairs department in city hall i felt that as a childless couple the job provided him a means to care not for his own but for other people s children the troubled ones who are neglected and left to fend for themselves in a rare moment of rage we see how he angrily chides such wayward parents who don t appreciate and wastes their children s lives away the story by kenji aoki provides little quirks to make its characters appeal and successfully attempted to provide a lot more glimpses and dimension into them as well such as how takanashi is a hopeless haiku poet despite being a member of the haiku club and supporting characters such as the aged minagawa couple where masao koichi ueda lent some comical though sad moments as he slowly turned senile while wife toshiko misako watanabe narrates and brings us through this love story of a single woman at even akiko nishina s performance as the bedridden wife was nothing short of arresting with her character s enlightened state of knowing her husband s past and making unselfish and painful decisions in her sickly state it s what you can expect from a typical japanese romantic movie sans young nubile leads as star crossed lovers but with all other elements in place such as romantic set ups love songs and those quintessential restrained but affectionate behaviour i thought the story was in danger of going down the beaten track when unrequited love gets consummated but director akira ogata managed to steer clear of the usual melodramatic moments in such stories though the story did call for some obvious plot development into the final act that you can predict especially if you re already way past your romance movie not being your average lovey dovey story i thought the milkwoman told a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme and frankly a recommended romance movie though told at a measured pace if you re in the mood for some bittersweet loving reminiscence and seeking to live without regrets 
i was looking forward to seeing this movie unfortunately i should have listened to my daughters advice this should have been a spoof but it took on a realism that corporations had a lot to answer for jim carrey after all the work he has done is still jim carrey and his comedy does not get any better his co star was not able to back him up their son in the movie was invisible the life of crime was a blink and that was the missing link of the movie the film showed or robberies and they were richer than before that where it lost it for me i did laugh in some parts butthrough the whole not good enough alecbaldwin i felt was there to add some weight to the film his character was not strong enough there were just too many gaps to make this a smart and tight movie 
i ve always liked barbara stanwyck who was perhaps the hardest working lead actress of the s and s although few of her movie roles are memorable today she is remembered most for the tv show the big valley stanwyck worked so much because she was durable it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence and so it was for christmas in connecticut a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn t even really about christmas it does however have stanwyck and dennis morgan as well as some supreme character actors including sydney greenstreet and s k sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in than they do today to begin the plot concerns a magazine writer stanwyck who the magazine s readers believe is a domestic goddess married with a child and living on a farm in connecticut but who is really single lives in new york city and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking could anyone get away with such a fraud even then apparently and even the owner of the magazine greenstreet is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and stanwyck greenstreet a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship morgan and stanwyck s restaurateur friend s z sakall find themselves spending christmas in connecticut at a farm belonging to stanwyck s boorish boyfriend reginald gardiner you can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must gardiner wants stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all morgan and stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married regardless they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh meanwhile the incredibly naive greenstreet character who has seen stanwyck and morgan go off together but still doesn t get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping stanwyck and morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind at this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd not funny ha ha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did the good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after i watch this movie every year at christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in and because of a long held fascination with barbara stanwyck thank goodness it was set at christmas or like percent of stanwyck s movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew 
i really enjoyed fierce people i discovered the film by accident searching through my on demand movie lists trying to find something interesting to watch the film is mostly about class in america and it quickly grabs your attention the characters are smart and articulate and the story doesn t stick to the usual hollywood rules the main protagonist is finn a precocious but underprivileged year old who spends his summer with the osbourne family donald sutherland plays the patriarch ogden c osborne the seventh richest man in america diane lane plays finn s mother a friend of ogden who is also a habitual cocaine user and a slut the osbournes own a large estate and seems to live by their own rules at first they seem charming and sophisticated but the super rich are different they are used to getting their own way the film is enjoyable mainly because it has crisp intelligent dialog superb acting and a story which takes unexpected turns it is also an r rated movie so it s not entirely wholesome the cast is excellent anton yelchin is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of finn sutherland and diane lane have never been better chris evans is impressive as osbourne s devious grandson kristen stewart is good as the pretty grand daughter high quality movie 
i would give this a zero if they had that rating fun was no fun at all i grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better it did not the others i watched this movie with also agreed the acting was annoying i am tired of jim carey s over the top ham acting the supporting cast was no better while this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under the vehicle for this would have been better served another way i actually disliked the leading characters dick and jane so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic i am trying to recall one scene where i or anyone i was with laughed and cannot a worthless movie and a total waste of time 
first off i am a huge fan of robert blake always have been this movie came on movieplex last night and the title interested me of course the star but after watching it i was left more confused than i was before it started there are some good scenes and i thought they would lead somewhere but they didn t it turned out to be an anti cop anti buddy anti hippie pretty much anti everything movie with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere robert blake is great as the lead well as great as someone could be with this bad movie i am still a huge fan of mr blake and love his acting even in crap like this but this drug induced s tripe well better stay away from this one and that ending what a pisser 
as an avid reader of clive barker i truly anticipated this film prior to it s release i was not let down nightbreed is a horse of a different color rich in the underlying decay of western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before barker is at his best when he allows us to peek into his world of unprecedented horror yet showing us the other side of the coin here the monsters are the hideously beautiful beings while the humans are the deceptively ugly creatures of self indulgence we soon learn that we were wrong all along by far my favorite performance by the often under used craig sheffer and the added bonus of david cronenberg as decker is a cast best seen then believed the monsters are portrayed flawlessly by a bevy of english creature masters whom many also brought the cenobites to life in hellraiser including pinhead himself doug bradley nightbreed is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre and anyone who needs just a little something more out of their horror story this is clive barker at his finest 
i was very curious to see this wajda depardieu outing plus the time period is definitely fascinating being a wajda fan i was disappointed and that may be an understatement the film never really took cinematic flight there s no foundation for the animosity between danton and robespierre etc basically the script was weak adapted from the danton affair and yet the direction was masterful it s wajda afterall also there were some amazing actors but they never really grab the audience s attention like they should depardieu comes off as a quasi goofy nonchalant danton not exactly the image we have in mind woijech pzsoniak is incredible as usual but again the script puts up limits even actors of great talent can t break down andrzej seweryn and bogoslaw linda pop up as bourdon and saint just and if you re familiar with wajda then you d know them overall i was disappointed with this much lauded film great cast great director but no quality foundation bad undynamic script we need to get in danton walesa and robespierre s general j mindsets what are their motivations eh who knows one likes women the other powders himself riiight ok so if you re looking for a great french revolution movie i highly recommend la revolution francaise it s in two parts and oh so great excellent performances in depth script juicy tid bits definitely a satisfying experience klaus maria brandauer is a much better danton than depardieu the wonderful andrzej seweryn apparently took some notes from danton and is brilliant as robespierre see it now as for wajda fans you re better off with man of iron marble promised land and the like cheers 
hellraiser bloodline is where the sequel mediocrity of the hellraiser series well and truly sets in gone is the imagination and invention of the first two movies gone is the ethos of pinhead and his minions gone are the sick desires of humans in fact everything that once made hellraiser so original has been trashed by this mess of a picture all that is left is that basic premise of christian mythology that there is a hell with evil demons what happened to the evil that men do this watered down excuse for a hellraiser movie is padded out with endless psycho babble so that pinhead becomes a nonsense spouting philosopher and not the harbinger of doom as he is meant to be the film uses the most basic of film formulas with characters separating and getting individually killed pinhead is not alien the link between the box and the demons or hell is never established it just arrives at a sacrifice and sits on a sideboard the lead female character is called rimmer and the producers obviously think it really funny because everyone keep saying her name really the film should have been retitled to give it that characters name shame on you kevin yagher and alan smithee 
the story was well plotted and interesting by itself however it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you to avoid that i am not going to talking the story here i regard this film as a good adaption of sarah water s book as compared with the previous one tipping the velvet i read the book first and then watched the dvd later the film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book of course due to the time limitation the film in the last min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part iii of the book therefore it couldn t illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of mr ibbs s place and those after that even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene despite that the film actually did a good job in representing the story it really worth watching it s still unclear when bbc america can broadcast this film that s pity ps noticed that the ages of maud and sue were set to be instead of in the book the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses 
irrespective of the accuracy of facts bandit queen is a true story its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in this movie is violent powerful and thought provoking the protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood whose adversity brought out the best or worst out of her keeping the subjectivity aside there is no doubt that phoolan s character from a young girl of who is married off by her father to clear a debt pun intended to a gang leader who goes on to become a leader of the lower caste has evolved into a champion in her own right her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre i can understand if the western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece bandit queen needs to be studied in the indian context and not just checked out in stereotypes i may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal but its certainly a must watch for the indian audience its a shame that the movie had a delayed overtly censored release in india bandit queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in india being a woman and that too a lower caste her rebellious nature and inability to just give in caused her the most horrible experiences in life which only went on to strengthen her into a self proclaimed goddess she responded to violence with violence and dint become the submissive woman society wanted her to be call it divine justice or judiciary failure had she killed a single person she would have been hanged she killed and got revered respected and glorified p s whoever found her character psychotic needs to be sodomized at gangraped by men at a go and paraded naked then they should be asked how normal do they feel 
the films use of blue black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work in fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings at least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set pieces were quite stunning black gore is hardly frightening nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp lugosi style the narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine naked lunch directed by russ meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be william burroughs esque otherwise give this film a wide girth bava and argento fans once again are bitterly disappointed 
 yesterday as a movie is hard to rate the cinematography is excellent and deserves a the story is gritty and real and does not compromise but the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work as a person who was born and raised in central africa i appreciated the authenticity of the film s look and the honest depiction of daily life for the zulu but this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film it takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of yesterday unlike the film the gods must be crazy which was a comic look at one african culture encountering modern technology yesterday has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience the movie simply is not fit for the common western mind and i doubt it was intended for the western mind the scenes are long and slow the editing is not paced for a mph instant gratification world the dialog is not cleaver or witty it is real movies about health crises do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment it is education this movie is best viewed by those who know appreciate and love the way of life and the culture in sub sarah africa if you lack a broad enough world view to understand other cultures especially african cultures should skip this film do not waste you time with it go see talladega nights or larry the cable guy instead for your cross culture viewing i give it a for most who might want to see the movie but have no accurate understanding of african cultures for the viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world i would give it a 
so madonna isn t meryl streep still this is one of her first films and a comedy at that give her a break sure the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart w katherine hepburn bringing up baby for what it is though a piece of fluff it s quite a bit of fun to watch i ve yet to hear anyone that slams madonna s acting skills back it up w evidence or even adjectives other than awful bad or other such vague descriptive words if you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing how about whitney houston she s had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldn t act her way out of a hatbox the american public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power i think madonna has always been at least credible in her movies get real people madonna bashing is so s 
i thought godzilla was the worst movie ever until i saw this monstrosity my friends and i went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie we could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created we decided to look in the low budget horror section we looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women we finally decided on last slumber party the whoops we made a mistake it seems as though this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in k mart the actors were picked up at a salvation army and as for steven tyler we will just leave that to the imagination the plot of this movie was ridiculous spoiler alert while watching the movie there is absolutely no closure at all then come to find out all the events were just a dream this movie should also have been about minutes if all the camera zooms on still shots and scans of walls were taken out it would have been much shorter all i can say is i m glad there wasnt a sequel 
alfred hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own british film the man who knew too much this take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one mr hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next thus keeping a standard in his work robert burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and george tomasini s editing shows his talent ultimately bernard herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent royal albert hall in london at the climax of the picture james stewart was an actor that worked well with mr hitchcock in this version he plays a doctor from indiana on vacation with his wife and son when we meet him they are on their way to marrakesh in one local bus and the intrigue begins his wife is the lovely doris day at her best she had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother the film has some good supporting cast brenda debanzie bernard miles daniel gelin alan mowbray among others do a great job in portraying their characters although this is a light hitchcock one can t dismiss it as a failure the man who knew too much is a change of pace for hitchcock s fans 
corben bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters we watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports its has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood there are some really good ideas here but they just don t work actually the film s ideas are better handled in a film called pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap given the choice i d watch pontypool again rather than watch this film again 
perhaps the best movie ever made by director kevin tenney well his witchboard is not on the top of my all time horror list this one is a strange fascinating mixture between pin and child s play both better than this one but not so better sure the plot is contrived and perhaps too predictable but the actors are good rosalind allen is very pleasant to the eye and so is candance mckenzie god bless her for the shower scene the child actress is very good in interpreting the disturbed daughter and the pinocchio puppet is scary enough to give you a few thrills down the spine for a b movie not bad at all 
i still remember watching satya for the first time i was completely blown away here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and so believable despite company which was a very good effort and vaastav more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to satya when i watched ab tak for the first time i said to myself indian cops have their own satya now the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about the encounter at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out there is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine ab tak is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie editing seems non existent and hence effective the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you ve left the movie hall but for me what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character sandeep srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues i m afraid i ll end up re writing the entire script of the movie the movie boasts of some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as sub inspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster oh my god he learns under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes in him prasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive his conversations with sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster not that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best i ve ever seen in hindi cinema from the way he talks to his expressions from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea it s almost as if nana can do no wrong he is at his best in each and every scene especially when he s teaching jatin about how the police force functions his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country it s a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one last but in no way the least shimit amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment i just hope that he continues the great work and doesn t give in to bollywood isation if he can do that i m sure he ll be a force to reckon with in the coming years 
i remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister i was in grade and still a kid and the drive closed down years later but the film still lingers in my memory an adult movie which a kid finds entertaining that is a mark of excellence hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors and this film proves it i like the billy put down the ice cream scene and i remember the sctv version in there film i factory myself remember joe flairty crying please email me if you like the sctv skit not a bad film at all it is a story about a father and his son touching and intertaining i love the part where hoffman talks about killroy and how the streets change worth a second watch 
another first this french movie is my introduction to the world eric rohmer perhaps i m a bit hasty when i say that this is probably my last rohmer movie but i was immediately turned off by the way rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point there is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that i thought was never going to end honestly no matter how much i tried i couldn t understand why rohmer is so highly regarded among cinephiles he struck me as being one of those obnoxiously petulant people who are filled with hot air if this is a sample of what his movies are about i m not interested i don t care much for french cinema usually reflective and speculative to a fault so maybe i m biased 
it s long time that i and my wife didn t see such a boring thriller it s definitively not a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep this could be instead a very low budget tv crime series there are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don t miss anything we gave 
what is there to say about an anti establishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french new wave they discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth century cassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretation although my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important 
this was a great movie and safe for the entire family which one doesn t see much of anymore my wife and i and year old son loved it even though you had an inkling of how it would end it continued to be a fun journey and the final ending surprised us there should be more movies like this 
i have to say it is a sign that this film appeals to all ages if somebody by right should be shielding themselves away from anything remotely homosexual absolutely loves this thing i thought every last bit of this film was amazing and the casting was superb but i have to say anna chancellor where have you been all my life having previously seen anna in several other things i was completely blown away by how magnificent she was diana letherby may not be the most lovable of the characters but she could certainly take me home if she fancied 
frank tashlin s censored is a so so private snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he s to be stationed in the south pacific but the censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter these early scenes are the best with the unseen censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms nets and even a specially employed eagle the second half of the cartoon in which snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of technical fairy first class who is actually teaching him a lesson is less funny and climaxes with a disappointing only a dream finale the main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of snafu s extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare breasted albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times aimed at the military the snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes crowbarred in as they may be are by far the most erotic i ve come across in any of these shorts thus far despite all this i prefer the snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more usually resulting in the death of the main character for great examples of this seek out tashlin s the goldbrick or chuck jones s spies censored is fairly weak by comparison 
if there were two parts that the physically towering ugly charismatic actor g rard depardieu was born as a frenchman to play it must surely have been cyrano de bergerac and the orator georges danton here he dominates the film both through the breadth of his shoulders and the power of his voice his charisma carries the part despite the fact that it is made clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as any of the rest of them danton feasts while the people of paris starve but he is the one man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded committee of public safety in the name of freedom and he is presented as the hero of the film despite the fact that the source play practically idolises his opponent robespierre for those who know the characters from history there is interest to be had in identifying the minor parts the frog faced tallien couthon the cripple fouquier tinville the tribunal s prosecutor the dashing fop st just the epic painter david but the script cuts little slack in this respect names are often late in coming if minor characters are identified at all and there is no hollywood style info dump to make sure that the audience can place events in their historical context the film takes it for granted that you know what has gone before and what will happen after sometimes it takes too much for granted as when it relies on a close knowledge of dates to provide the sting to its tail in the fact that robespierre followed danton shortly to the scaffold considered as a film it s not entirely satisfactory in that it ebbs away towards the end the structure of the story leads up to some great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or some dramatic climax to the trial which thanks to history never actually happens things just fizzle out there is no revolt there is no overthrow of tyranny there is no assumption of power by the victor there is no triumph on either side it may be historically accurate but it s not entirely satisfying as the outcome of a screen scenario it seems an odd place to stop as others have commented it might have been more logical to take events up to the end of the terror and show in apposition the fall of robespierre 
the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to due in no small part to john woo s masterful direction coupled with kat s superb cinematography some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art house film both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can t help but love to hate tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad it s a role reversal the likes of which i don t think i ve ever seen before tien normally played a hero and in fact with his moustache i didn t even recognize him at first sammo s goofy buck teeth only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable in a villain you love to hate kind of way his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic jackie chan appears briefly early on and late in the going as a blacksmith and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent 
i absolutely love the first three movies they were great i once caught part on vhs years ago and i was disappointed but perhaps that was because i never saw the fourth one because they were shot back to back but after finally viewing a copy today i have to say it was no way better than number my expectations weren t high to begin with but this is cheap direct to video stuff not even a horror movie it s pg the acting was not convincing the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects but the main problem is that there were no kills or any gore the annoying kid who gets killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight but come on surprisingly both parts and were directed by sequel director jeff burr who gave us the excellent stepfather ii and leatherface texas chainsaw massacre iii i liked puppet master the legacy even if it was nothing else than a tribute with the best scenes from all movies overall puppet master is very much like the hellraiser series a great trilogy but forget the rest 
the worse film i have every seen like the other honest reviewers it is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their juggs out don t get wrong naked women isn t a bad thing but there is another film genre for that boyfriends beware i sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang fest due to reviews to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women gyrating about the place slap in the chops for me what makes me laugh the most is all the dogey bike dives they went to in the film were full of models with the works cosmetically what biker bars have these they are usually slightly haggard with tattoos and far saggier juggs completely unrealistic the acting is terrible loads of pointless swearing and a complete waste of time storyline did anyone check out vinnie jones s attempt at an american accent its as embarrassing as his football skills avoid like the plague the only reason you would watch this film is if you are a young lad who cant access p rn and have nicked it from their parents movie collection for a few pervy kicks 
quentin tarantino once said that to succeed in the film industry you had to make your own pulp fiction or reservoir dogs writer actor director larry bishop seems to have taken that advice a little too literally with hell ride and concocted a messy homage that borrows much too heavily in its visuals music camera work and time altering storytelling but to properly mimic a tarantino film one has to have a knack for constructing creative conversations unfortunately hell ride s primary derailing element is its atrocious ramblings and vulgar monologues that only work to disgust and confuse the audience while simultaneously invoking pity for the actors just for being involved the anti hero protagonist biker gang the victors consists of several weathered vigilantes who bring their own brand of bloodthirsty justice to the lawless roads the leader pistolero larry bishop is hell bent on revenge and putting out fires the gent michael madsen just tries to balance his chaotic psychotic symphony of life with putting lead into anyone who crosses his boss and comanche eric balfour follows with a fierce loyalty and a mysterious past on the villainous front deuce david carradine is the mastermind who orchestrates from afar though not quite far enough and billy wings vinnie jones spits venom and lewd explanations for his tattoos while toting a harpoon gun and a general disdain for life while these characters might sound interesting on paper once they re forced to rant horrendously ill conceived dialogue all traces of cool disappear faster than the funding should for bishop s next film while hell ride is riddled with imperfections and missed opportunities the main facet of its undoing lies in the poorly devised conversations and because bishop s main influences are the talky films of tarantino there are a lot of them the first twenty minutes of the movie are nearly unintelligible and would probably make as much sense muted by the time pistolero s main squeeze is introduced and certain phrases are overused to the point of nausea you ll pray for both death and the ability to turn the sound off even dennis hopper has trouble remaining cool while spouting off such goofy dialogue have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so many times that it just doesn t sound right or even make sense anymore bishop starts there and then keeps the madness going until you envy the characters on screen getting their heads cut off and when the dialogue finally takes a break we re treated to interspersed shots of nude female oil wrestling and throats being slashed i m not sure what effect bishop hoped to attain but i doubt he found it hell ride wants to pay homage to quentin tarantino films robert rodriguez films and every movie that idolizes the violent and devil may care attitudes of bikers but while its intentions may be noble the horrendously cringe worthy dialogue and the hyper stylized timeline mangling editing prevents the audience from becoming invested with the generic tough guy characters by the time we figure out the mystery behind the characters motives and it may be awhile before you even realize there s a mystery to be solved it s just too hard to care anymore and while everyone on screen is clearly having fun they ve entirely neglected to translate any of that entertainment to the audience joel massie
at the surface cooley high is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading as a period piece set in the early s complete with a flawless motown soundtrack but there s so much more to this film it gets better every time i see it the cast of unknowns at the time is excellent and it is notable as an all black cast film that doesn t fall into any blaxpoitation clich s at times cooley high almost feels like an updated urban neo realist film with lots of edgy humor added in at times the rather tight budget does show but the constraints actually serve the film well there s a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similar minded films like schultz later car wash which was more popular but largely pointless warm hearted but also true to life this might be one of the sleepers of the s celebrated at the time it seems that few film freaks know about this one today their loss this is a fine fine film the bare bones pan and scan dvd no widescreen is testament to just how little cared for this excellent film is 
this is clive barker s masterpiece in my opinion the movie has a great storyline and some amazing make up and effects the one thing i would love to see happen is a sequel the movie was set up for a sequel and with improved technology the second movie could be incredible david cronenberg must appear in a sequel as well as craig sheffer but this particular movie was a great original creative and entertaining idea and i could watch it over and over again cronenberg was perfect in this movie and sheffer added an interesting spice to the film 
three words piece of art this film is just great it s beautiful sad frightening and thought provoking at the same time the score constantly stays in my head the acting is wonderful the scenery scary and beautiful at the same time it was more by chance than on purpose that i saw this movie at the time i decided to watch this movie i was just bored and read lists of asian films which maybe good well i saw the title a tale of two sisters which sounded very interesting then i read the summary of the plot and decided you don t just watch this film you ve gotta buy it said done i bought this film and was hooked from the very first minute the plot kept me interested from the beginning till the end the twist near the end of the film made me scream i really didn t see something like this coming and the ending scene made me cry it just made me cry it was so sad well i recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is as i mentioned before a very sad one but this just fits in the mood of the film doesn t it 
 the cave got released more or less simultaneously with the english film the descent directed by neil marshall both movies share a similar premise only the cave is dreadfully unoriginal unexciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is the descent it feels like neil marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas depth and a personalized style whereas the cave director bruce hunt simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay that was thrown on his desk the result is an unbelievably mediocre film that features every single horror clich you can think of and in which most of the violence happens off screen and we all hate that don t we the story introduces a clique of insufferable cave divers that become trapped in a completely undiscovered romanian underground ecosystem hideous winged creatures that also happen to be parasites soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to a landslide the first half hour is still mildly entertaining if you keep yourself busy with spotting all the clich s and listening to the cheesy textbook dialogs but the whole thing just gets too dire none of the events are even slightly plausible and it looks like the entire cast is competing with each other to deliver the worst performance i ve seen better special effects in anonymous b movies already the filming locations aren t used to the fullest and the ending downright sucks very much not recommended 
this movie was extremely boring i only laughed a few times i decided to rent it when i noticed william shatner s name on the cover it s all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist he meets a prostitute she takes him to a club called the playground where he befriends several pimps when mayor tony gold shatner decides to take over the pimp business lil pimp must lay down for his homies the animation isn t very good in this it looks like it was made with macromedia which i m sure it was it doesn t suck it s just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years the humor in this is not very good i didn t think any of it was funny 
the main character of this sex filled drivel mel ethan hunt notes on several occasions she deserves better than this the she he refers to is ginger played by beautiful brandy davis who indeed does deserve better than this brandy deserves better than this film its lame script and perverted mel a guy who gets off at watching his dream girl have sex with another man even in virtual world seriously does not deserve her at all an a for the simulated sex scenes an f for the script 
dragon ma jackie chan is back having rid the seas of the dreaded pirate lo back on land he is assigned to the police force where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb along the way he is caught up in the fate of several chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause the chinese manchu government is after these revolutionaries and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble even if they are in the police force i had big expectations for this movie after i saw project a but sadly i was a little disappointed there is just too little action compared to the first film there is just one good fight scene until the big ending that fight scene is in the gangsters place and its good a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw jackie chan and his stunt team don t disappoint here at all the ending is very entertaining jackie chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world really exciting stuff the only bad thing with the ending is that the fights are too short and forgettable conclusion many funny moments good acting and crazy stunts but not enough fighting for a top rating 
i ve tried watching it twice though i haven t been able to make through either episode for me it s basically just not funny i can tell where i m suppose to laugh but i can t i ve never seen the original so i m not comparing i also love comedies including off the wall comedies like married with children and family guy but this show just doesn t do it for me the jokes are lame and flat and the acting is mostly annoying the commercials made it look interesting but it isn t they re trying too hard to be different and tying to force the humor that style usually doesn t work too well i don t think this show finishes the season of course i could be wrong 
this is one of my favourite movies ever i have seen it about a million times and would never turn down the opportunity to watch it again in fact i love it so much that i really wanted to check out the resort where it was filmed on my upcoming vacation does anyone know the name of it if so please email me i watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and i was about nikki s age and for the longest time i bugged my dad to take me to away somewhere because of course i expected the same thing to happen to me it s just such an amazing setting and such a cute puppy love story this is a definite dvd collector s must 
this film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending but don t be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly only a little unexpectedly though nothing worth watching the thing through for from the taciturn and wronged hero to the germanic baddy to the expendable team the characters were entirely wooden and obvious the two fbi agents smith and wesson geddit gave some hope of humour but that came to nothing i am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film a turkey 
what is often neglected about harold lloyd is that he was an actor unlike chaplin and keaton lloyd didn t have the vaudeville music hall background and he wasn t a natural comedian he came to hollywood to act and he discovered he had a knack for acting funny first in shorts then in features he made a name for himself as lonesome luke a chaplin knock off with the glasses character that made him the all american boy rather than a grotesque lloyd found his stride and his movies became some of the best produced during the silent era he developed a reputation as a daredevil in some shorts and retained this in some of his best movies safety last for heaven s sake girl shy he was more popular than either chaplin or keaton during the twenties and he became very rich before the advent of sound the first sound movies were often disasters to get the most out of their sound too much dialog was used in many movies lloyd s acting skills were after two decades geared for silents he didn t have a bad voice its high pitch suited his glasses character and his sound films weren t the unqualified disasters of legend yet silent movies had been raised to a high art especially lloyd s which did not stint on budget and were extremely well crafted with the introduction of talkies movies had to learn to walk again and they made some missteps though he tried to move with the times and embraced sound lloyd s best bits from his early overly talky talkies were still visual such as the scene in movie crazy where he appears to be riding in a swank car but actually hitched a ride on his bicycle trying to recapture the daredevil antics that made him famous as he did in feet first was misstep in safety last his best movie and the one that deservedly or not shoved lloyd in the box as a daredevil comic he played a determined young man climbing to the top safety last had a natural structure that ascended to his character s scaling the side of the building he was obviously afraid but his fear added to the humor in feet first he arrived in a precarious building scaling position by accident his frantic cries for help detracted from the humor his character was pathetic and cringing aspiration to save his neck possibly an accurate statement of the s but not amusing harold lloyd was not mired in the past like some wacky norma desmond he embraced sound and tried to take his movies in different directions growing and changing with the industry when feet first failed he left the daredevil business and made a satire on the talking movie industry movie crazy just as he had to flounder through many movies as lonesome luke before carving his place in movie history with the glasses character he had tried several directions in sound movies before hitting his stride in sound which he did with the catspaw in the catspaw he plays a missionary s son reared in china who unwittingly gets elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests when he finds out the truth he sets himself the task of cleaning up the town only in his early forties lloyd could still act the brash young man yet the catspaw was another box office failure and lloyd made only three more movies including the milky way of his chief competitors chaplin still had silent movies in him and keaton was hopelessly mismanaged the catspaw and the milky way suggest lloyd might have mastered sound comedy if he had been a little younger or if audiences had given him the benefit of the doubt after his early sound fiascoes though the movie has been unfairly maligned about the way lloyd s character cleaned up the town it suits him from his days in shorts lloyd wanted to scare his audience and the climax of the catspaw achieved it yet again in a surprising way until the trick is revealed it appears gruesome and then come the laughs viewed as a product of its time the catspaw is charming and funny a very well written sound comedy well acted by lloyd directed by sam taylor its curious blend of drama and sly humor make it look almost like a frank capra or preston sturges comedy 
when i saw that this film was being aired on late night tv i initially decided to give it a miss i am glad that i then started watching yes the special effects are the same as gerry andersen s puppet shows some of the actors actresses are from his other productions he obviously used the same composer later on as the cheesy soundtrack could only have come from one of his productions and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend get by all that and you have a film that shows up intriguing possibilities is there a planet on the far side of the sun is it a duplicate earth is everything about it reversed and if so do they speak english in reverse i love this dated sf if only for gerry s wonderful model cars planes buildings and spaceships some of them are not so far fetched as they seemed back then and did you see the european space centre logo very reminiscent of the euro logo of today suspend belief and spend a couple of hours watching this you will be glad you did 
here is a rundown of a typical rachael ray show the awful theme song begins to play and rachael descends wearing her snapcrotch outfit in this bizarre cargo elevator she begins running around screaming and or insulting the audience then yells at them sit down an awkward monologue the next are in any order a segment tooting rachael s own horn i e i lost pounds with rach s recipes rachael ray saved my life rachael s fashion tips a totally useless d i y tip i e how to engrave words into casserole dishes how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it the unleashing of horrible recipe on the unsuspecting audience reaction shots of first bites are never shown a celebrity guest with an awkward interview followed by some obviously scripted questions from the audience a person who gets help from one of rachael s cronies i e the i say yes to everything woman the i own nothing but overalls lady and the i can t find time to put on makeup housewife what would they do without you rachael gasp reasons that this show should be avoided like the plague fakeness rachael ray claims that entire show is unscripted many people who have attended tapings of the show have claimed that the entire show is scripted many of these same people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show her show jumps around too much where as oprah who is the highest rated talk show host of all time has a definite theme for her show rachael s jumps around like an adhd soda child on crack her show averages perhaps short worthless segments a show on second you will be getting fashion tips from kojo and the next rachael will be making gross stuffed spanish peppers with manchego cheese and the next their will be a giant anaconda up on stage and the next well you get the picture rachael is a poor host with bad ideas aside from her grating personality rachael s hosting ability is terrible at best her questions for her celebrity guests are poor and often times not even relevant to the interview and her segments are unappealing and offer little educational or humorous value in conclusion you need not waste your time with this schlock it will be canceled soon anyways 
stealing is a crime and these guys kenny yakkel and corbin bernsen look like their going to get away with it i haven t even seen this film but not only do i know it sucks but the fact that it steals the story of another film or films for that matter is such bull crap and if imdb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap that i become filled with rage and feel as though i should just throw myself out the window and just end it all o k that s a little much but stealing is worse ever seen pontypool it was this awesome little zombie film made in this radio host goes into work and then this zombie attack happens we only see what s going on inside the radio station and the only guess we have on what s happening on the outside are the occasional calls from their eye in the sky ken loney easily the funniest moment in the film in my mind and the bbc calling in for an update on the situation from all the reviews i ve read and from the conversation i had with my friend who has seen this film and pontypool this film was exactly like it in the story with minor tweaks here and there so throw originality and creativity out the window as for the zombies or the infected whatever you want to call them they are the exact same thing just because they got infected does not change the fact that they walk around mindlessly and have a never ending quench for flesh they are zombies zombies zombies okay one to many but back to this crappy movie the zombies from what i ve heard are a lot like the ones in days later another better movie with their insane rage and even more insane quench of flesh this is where zombie movies define themselves story does not matter in a zombie movie as long as your not taking the idea of another film sure a zombie movie can be enhanced by the story as is the case with pontypool but the zombies have to be in a way original days later started the insane raging zombie pontypool i can t even begin to explain those guys without ruining the film the evil dead i think all i have to do is just type the name again because come on it s the evil dead romero is the master and he went through all different types of zombies from the painted face zombies in dawn of the dead to raging zombies in diary of the dead and he did each one with his own unique style so after talking about other great zombie movies i think it s about time i explain why i hate this movie without even seeing it this movie down right steals the original story outline to pontypool which i think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people get kicked out of school for doing this very thing yet in hollywood it s allowed and apparently approved of this is not the only film that takes the outline of another movie and just tries to tell it differently the s is like the worst period for movies ever sure it had some gems but what decade doesn t and it s because all the movies were the exact same my favorite the crime movie with a twist so big that you ll never guess it till the very end they force feed you one suspect make it seem impossible that it s not anybody else but him then bam all this time it was this guy you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn t there and then when he would mysteriously show up out of the blue say hey guys what did i miss oh didn t see that coming did ya well i ll leave a clich as my closing statement this is one film you ll surely want to miss 
the production company for this film calls itself nott entertainment and that is a surprisingly apt name this very is very nott entertaining from start to finish which is a shame because a mix of zombie movie and western could have been interesting every time a low budget zombie movie is released it will tend to be for the fans by the fans i do actually consider myself a fan of zombie movies but too many more like this one and i ll be re evaluating my opinion the film seems to be a rip off of the half decent aussie zombie flick undead expect instead of just having the lead in a cowboy hat everyone is wearing one but this doesn t make a lot of sense because the film is apparently set in modern times the credits sequence at the start of the movie fools us into believing that we re going to be in for an atmospheric film but when the movie starts properly it soon becomes apparent what we re actually in for naturally there s a fair amount of gore and it is actually fairly well done though the good things i have to say about the film pretty much end there there s a twist half way through which might have been interesting if the rest of the film was overall this is just another zombie movie in a world with far too many zombie movies i don t recommend it 
i absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist barbara stanwyck for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful connecticut home the trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a ww hero as guests during the christmas holidays why is she worried because she lives in a small new york apartment isn t married and doesn t have a baby and can t cook at all hilarity and romance ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face keep from being fired by the magazine owner played by sydney greenstreet this is a delightful comedy one that i highly recommend to classic movie lovers 
the worst movie i ve ever seen and i ve seen allot acting is horrible plot is awful idea is terrible and no research was done what s so ever ok i admit `air bud was a pretty good movie but not `soccer dog this dog is smaller than my cat how can he possibly play soccer even for years old kids it won t be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to brake the stupid dog in half it s horrible don t watch this movie 
reba sucks it sucks hard it s about this awful country singer attempting comedy they might as well call this show generic because that s what it is it s dumb and generic reba you re not funny and i m glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck and so does brock barbra jean the red headed teenager that jockey guy and the year old who got knocked up you all suck and none of you are funny oh and i heard a rumor that reba is actually a gay devil worshipper who idolizes hitler and tortures animals and she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her music in hopes to make children kill their parents and kill themselves but it was just a rumor anyway this is the worst show ever reba is gay i do not like her i think the office is better than this show and this show sucks 
this film says everything there is to say about religion i wish it were required viewing for all bigots and would be clericals the story set in a turn of the century danish villages is about two very religious sisters whose late father was a rigid priest who discouraged all their dreams of love and exploring the world and its many beauty they are now old and their life and beauty spent their quiet new help whom they teach to cook is babette played by the lovely stephane audran who graced so many of her husband claude chabrol s films the life in the village is simple and the stark direction reflects that when babette wins the lottery she requests a chance to prepare a feast a true labour of love the course of the feast and its chief guest reveal messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love god and life this is a must see for the devotion with which babette prepares the feast and for the speech the general gives at the end possibly the best international film of the s 
the filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in which includes an manuscript by richard williams bell son of john and lucy bell and younger brother of betsy bell titled our family trouble to knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned the filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality the acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor it appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line if you must know the story read about it its much more gripping and conclusive 
i don t know whether this film hits my heart the way it does because of the feelings of friendship love closeness to others or the warmth of that transformation babette s cooking creates but when the feast starts and for the rest of the movie i choke up often yes this is a feel good movie but without a speck of mawkishness or facile sentimentality please note that elements of the plot are discussed babette s feast tells its story with restraint and care and it lets us discover for ourselves the values of grace and love all we need to know is that babette harsant stephane audran was a french refugee who was given shelter by two aging sisters in a tiny community on the coast of jutland the sisters lead what remains of their father s flock he was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes through self denial the sisters made their sacrifices to duty and faith those who still remain honor the now long dead pastor s teachings and his spiritual guidance still as they have grown older the tiny community has become querulous and argumentative the sisters do what they can for the pastor s th birthday babette wishes to cook the dinner for the small group the sisters will invite the sisters reluctantly agree but when they see the supplies babette has ordered they and their guests become uneasy they are used to the community s usual fare of dried cod boiled and a soup made of bread water and a little ale even though babette over time has made improvements what they are seeing now seems close to godlessness at the dinner also will be a visitor general lorens lowenhielm who years earlier had chosen ambition over his love for one of the sisters what do we experience there is the austerity of the aging community s faith and the stone wind swept cottages they live in there is the warmth by candlelight of the sisters small crowded dining room and then there is the transforming power of babette s artistry as we watch her cook watch erik a young boy helping her serve and pour and watch the old parishioners with the help of fine wine and exquisite cooking gradually rediscover their community and love and friendship the general serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they are eating the general tells a story to his uncomprehending dinner companions a story about a famed woman who was the exemplary chef at the famed caf anglais in paris this woman this head chef had the ability to transform a dinner into a kind of love affair a love affair that made no distinction between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite he too is being transformed into a man who will accept what he has become and yet will always know the value and the love of what long ago he chose not to accept an old couple kiss two old men remember past friendships and babette who spent all that she had won in a lottery on this dinner has had an opportunity to be the artist she once was in france an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship babette now as poor as she was when she arrived penniless years earlier will continue with the sisters the general in a carriage with his aunt returns to her estate and the elderly guests leave the sisters home to return to their own cottages they pause and look at the clear night sky and the stars overhead they spontaneously hold hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn the clock strikes and time goes by eternity is nigh let us use this time to try to serve the lord with heart and mind so that our true home we shall find so that our true home we shall find they smile at each other all has been reconciled babette s feast is a wonderful movie full of restrained emotion unspoken understandings wisdom and of course a meal that will leave you with a growling stomach as you exit the theater if you win a lottery so you could afford what babette created and have her skill and artistry here s what she served potage a la tortue a rich turtle soup served with amontillado sherry blinis demidoff au caviar small buckwheat pancakes with sour cream and caviar served with veuve clicquot champagne cailles en sarcophage with sauce perigourdine boned quail stuffed with foie gras and truffle in puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with madeira served with clos de vougeot a fine burgundy salade cheese and fresh fruit baba au rhum with glacee fruit and fresh figs coffee and a fine brandy
being a long time fan of japanese film i expected more than this i can t really be bothered to write to much as this movie is just so poor the story might be the cutest romantic little something ever pity i couldn t stand the awful acting the mess they called pacing and the standard quirky japanese story if you ve noticed how many japanese movies use characters plots and twists that seem too different forcedly so then steer clear of this movie seriously a year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along and that s not a good thing in my book fans of beat takeshi his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo and unless you re a rabid fan you don t need to suffer through this waste of film 
the english translation of the title on the dvd version of this film is graveyard of horrors but i think that must be an error it should have been called graveyard of horribles horrible acting horrible editing horrible story and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard horrible 
all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid it is pretty boring and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff a couple exchanging nods over their good grub a medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes sits down and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace quadruple takes or more when people look at things solitary banjo tuning and playing taking a break for a beer telling a joke to a fawn about a big mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies complete with many big mouthed expressions which are needed for the weak punchline the sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread which to the squeamish become unpalatable when there s talk of people burned in a fire lots of seemingly stock footage close up shots of animals birds insects and spiders in the woods the movie starts with a forest fire then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe the killer evidently wasn t too satisfied by the axe he stole and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare hands if it s true that the movie in the version available on the out of print videotape is cut perhaps if there s a lot of footage that was cut it deserves another look on dvd otherwise it s simply not very interesting and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoors slasher fan 
 her excellency madam shabana azmi has worked in countless movies over life time i think best is yet to come fire is ok but still good days are yet to come hopefully in water i will be able see her better thanks and regards ps india doesn t have a director to make best use of her 
i have always liked this film and i m glad it s available finally on dvd so more viewers can see what i have been telling them all these years story is about a high school virgin named gary lawrence monoson who works at a pizza place as a delivery boy and he hangs out with his friends david joe rubbo and rick steve antin gary notices karen diane franklin who is the new girl in school and one morning he gives her a ride and by this time he is totally in love that night at a party he see s rick with karen and now he is jealous of his best friend but doesn t tell anyone of his true feelings spoiler alert rick asks gary if he can borrow his grandmothers vacant home but gary makes up an excuse so that rick can t get karen alone but one night rick brags to gary that he nailed her at the football field and gary becomes enraged a few days later in the school library gary see s rick and karen arguing and he asks karen what is wrong she tells him that she s pregnant and that rick has dumped her gary helps her by taking her to his grandmothers home and paying for her abortion finally gary tells karen how he really feels about her and she seems receptive to his feelings but later at her birthday party he walks in on karen and rick together again gary drives off without the girl this film ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is no matter how nice you are you don t necessarily get the girl this film was directed by boaz davidson who would go on to be a pretty competent action film director and he did two things right with this movie first he made sure that there was plenty of gratuitous nudity so that this was marketable to the young males that usually go to these films secondly he had the film end with young gary without karen and i think the males in the audience can relate to being screwed over no matter how hard you try and win a girls heart yes this film is silly and exploitive but it is funny and sexy actress louisa moritz almost steals the film as the sexy carmela moritz was always a popular b level actress and you might remember her in one flew over the cuckoo s nest like fast times at ridgemont high this has a very good soundtrack and the songs being played reflect what is going on in the story but at the heart of this film is two very good performances by monoson and franklin there is nudity required by franklin but she still conveys the sorrow of a young girl who gets dumped at a crucial time she s always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this film but this is still monoson s story and you can t help but feel for this guy when the film ends it s his performance that stays with you it s a solid job of acting that makes this more than just a teen sex comedy even with the silly scenarios of teens trying to have sex this film still manages to achieve what it wants underrated comedy hits the bullseye 
why oh why is this trash considered a classic i ve seen higher body counts on episodes of the simpsons virtually nothing happens in this film and much of it s running time is filled with nearly unbearable melodrama straight out of a low rent soap opera the trenton family are going through tough times and when dad is away mommy and little boy go to get the car fixed but when they get to the ranch they discover that the guard dog has gone mad the rest of the film is just them sitting in the car while the slobbering st bernard circles them over and over regarding the kid i have never ever seen a more annoying child in a film in my life and obviously he s completely aryan since blonde haired and blue eyed kids such as the one prominently featured on packets of kinder chocolate are apparently more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and dark hair like me all he does is cry and whine same goes for mommy she gets out the car she gets in the car she gets out the car she gets in the car i know this was made in but i just sick to death of horror films where the characters make stupid illogical decisions if mommy just used some common sense she d be able to get away from the icky dog it s very poorly written and there s zero tension if you want to see a good bad dog movie then check out john lafia s man s best friend it s funny inventive has a better dog a higher body count and a more involving story leave this garbage be 
one of the funniest most romantic and most musical movies ever definitely worth renting buying especially if you have a taste for older style of cinematography the animals and the songs alone will make you smile while watching the movie a definite must for madonna fans o 
there is one adjective that describes everything about this film acting plot effects continuity etc and that word is poor the government wants to asses the effects of space travel on certain organisms but the capsule crashes and a mutant something or other looks like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face wreaks havoc around the accident scene which includes a favorite place for the window fogging partying set therefore some young people as well as a law enforcement officer are among the creature s victims you gotta be extremely unparticular about how you spend your time or rich if you spend any money to view this epic 
don t ask me why i love this movie so much maybe it came at a time in my life i desperately wanted to fit in maybe it is the amazing monster effects maybe because i enjoyed the novel cabal but it s probably because i love clive barker i think it s fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you ll probably have a wtf moment at the end at least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie flopped for a few reasons the studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good or so minutes out of it and they did a horrible job promoting it the adverts made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the button face mask decker character this is a movie about the monsters about fantasy about a place called midian it s a story where the monsters are the good guys there is truly nothing else out there like it it s not a movie for everybody i suppose but it stands as one of clive s many great works sit back and be prepared to be taken to midian where the monsters are 
i saw this movie with my girlfriend it was a total disaster you can really see it was cheaply made badly scripted and with very bad acting i have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book we couldn t take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained the experience of watching this was like the blair witch visits green acres then there were parts that were vulgar they show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it the witch throws the contents of it on the boy and the whole family laughs i thought it was nasty and very strange i really can t understand why someone would think that would be entertaining it shows another scene where dr mize arrives and betsy bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother how sick the little boy in the first scene of the many scenes dealing with how your body disposes of wastes begs for toilet paper and goes to the out house and makes these sickening faces of joy with sound effects i think they should have left all of that out the makeup on the reverend james johnston as a older man didn t really make you assume he was older it made you think he was dipped in fish batter the blood on joshua gardner when he falls from the ladder is even worse the john bell death scene looks like they got out flour and tried to do something with it to make him look as a serious sick man to me to much sickening comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this picture these people would do better if they film commercials for local tv stations for bathroom products they chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner i rate this film capital f minus 
 spoiler alert this was the worst of the series it is horror disguised as political satire and it is as subtle as a sledge hammer not very scary and not very insightful did micheal moore have anything to do with this piece of garbage i m really sick of hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against george bush and constantly repeating the same talking points over and over again this movie wants to be deathdream but unlike that movie which subtly poignantly tackled the problems soldiers who came back from vietnam by clever making the main character come back as a blood craving zombie and slowly built on this theme it was a true horror film that was also good social commentary because it didn t get sanctimonious exploitave and preachy i guess joe dante thought this was trying to make a horror film to scare republicans conservatives and libertarians and me being the last in that list found this film to be totally ridiculous manipulative and exploitave all at the same time and i don t mean the good type of exploitative that you often find in the drive in type movies i mean exploitative in the most sickening and vile manner using the deaths of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror film this film assumes that all the soldiers who died in iraq would vote against a conservative president if they would come back to life as zombies which is a flawed premise because as i recall for the most part and going by george romero s rules zombies are mindless flesh eating creatures operating on pure impulse and even though the zombie andy in deathdream could talk he couldn t really hold a conversation and he was driven by his addiction to human blood okay zombies are mindless creatures driven by impulse and not intellect and obviously they are dead so why would dead people be allowed to vote in the first place my interpretation of this film is that the only war a liberal democrat could win is by having mindless dead people vote for him i guess they meant to say the people that vote for presidents like george bush are the mindless zombies while the real mindless zombies are actually the ones making the intellectually sounds decisions yeah whatever dawn of the dead tackled this idea much better but user the idea of mindless consumerism this film isn t dawn of the dead by any stretched of the imagination the film addresses the issue while the soldiers are alive that a majority of them voted for a bush like president but after they die they would vote for a liberal anti war democrat after they are zombies who are normally considered brain dead creatures and laughably has them destruct after they vote if you are gonna make a zombie movie mr dante and invoke george romero s name in it you better have mindless zombies that like ripping people apart and eating their intestines not zombies that vote i also like how the zombies just go evil conservatives who support the war if you want a good movie with social commentary skip this poorly made preachy piece of junk and watch deathdream instead the worst of the master of horror series hands down 
while it s not perfect it s close love barbara stanwyck sz sakall sidney greenstreet dennis morgan robert shayne superman s police chief the housekeeper the waiter at restaurant felix and the judge i can go on and on this movie has been part of my family s holiday tradition since i was a youngster and my children grew up with it too the baby swallowed the watch was always my son s favorite line sexy barbara stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly funny s z sakall dennis morgan has a few great songs too i highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake blah 
isabelle huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation la pianiste truly confirms it as if that wasn t enough annie girardot plays her mother and annie girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation so as you may well imagine those pieces of casting are worth the horror we re put through isabelle and annie play characters we ve never seen before on the screen a mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes i was unable even to blink or to breath personally i don t believe in the director s intentions i don t believe they the intentions that is go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but i was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational huppert and the fierceness of girardot s strength i highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the collectors of great performances like me you can t afford to miss la pianiste 
okay when i bought this flick i though this gotta be the ultimate b movie space monkey landing to the earth and starts right away to kill people well it was almost everything what i expected typical low budget scifi movie from the s acting has to be the worst i ve ever seen especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off so why night fright doesn t fall in to category so bad that it s good reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring for example the scene were the police officers are searching clues in the woods it was just minutes of walking without purpose and then the grand finale the people s waiting for the monster about minutes and when the space monkey appears it get wack d in second end of film yeah night fright is boring but it got couple of funny moments i can recommend this movie to all who liked films like zontar the thing from venus or curse of the swamp creature i give night fright space monkey slaps out of rob gruesome 
for a series that was inspired by kolchak it s ironic that the x files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it s ass has always puzzled me and at the risk of sounding like the dreadful hans keller i ve often wondered if i m missing the point the story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don t match the box and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea this incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it i know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to whitby by teenage vampires who ll drink my blood while listening to busted but that s a risk i m willing to take i ve always been a werewolf man myself 
movie about two australian girls debbie nell schofield and sue sue knight and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys i caught this at an art cinema here in america in technically i was still a teenager i was so i was interested in seeing how australian teens acted script wise there s nothing new here it shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating sex suicide etc etc i always knew what was going to happen before it did but i was never bored what i found interesting was despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair these teenagers aren t much different than american teens they had many of the same difficulties and hang ups also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and i heard it was a faithful adaptation of it the acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and this was well made and pretty interesting so this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it s like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids i give it a 
i have no idea why people are so crazy about the show it is so boring the jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny it s like alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there s a laughing sound background my friend and i just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other what s so funny seriously every time we watched that show you wouldn t hear any laughing or coughing just a blank look so we stop watching it i am personally a fan of sitcoms so i tried to watch the show but the show us such a disappointment this show might be one of the worst comedy sitcom ever 
the worst movie i ve seen in years and i ve seen a lot of movies acting is terrible there is no plot whatsoever there is no point whatsoever i felt robbed after i rented this movie they recommended it to me mind you a disgrace for terrible movies stay away from this terrible piece of c p save your money 
i had to suffer through this movie three times while i was a zombie extra in the director s new movie after sundown the first time that i saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters i could not take it any more i busted out laughing right in front of the guy the movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent female nudity was nowhere to be found i am a fan of low budget horror movies but this was just too much for me the worst part was that i had to watch it so many times also do not expect the new movie to be any better 
i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressed it is essentially a mystery thriller where this girl who can t remember anything gets rescued by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool i really liked the setting of this one a desolate post modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings very metropolitan groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity surprising it was made in seems somewhat ahead of it s time out of kids 
this is a funny intelligent and in a sense realistic comedy about a year old trying to live her first love while on vacation and also about the complex sometimes amusing sometimes touching relation between a divorced father and her growing daughter and about how far a women not only nicole the teen ager can go to get the man she loves i laughed a lot with this lively scenario that never drags 
for those of you who have no idea what bug juice is or was it was a children s reality show about real kids living at summer camp bug juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp it was full of romance friendships fights overcoming your fears and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for months it was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t v regularly but is amazing non the less the show was never dull and always attracted my attention it s really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it s like before going plus disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show that s at a camp for like only a week the length of the camps where perfect for this show and the environment they where in was fantastic they where camps all over the u s that each provided unique activities for the campers it was a truly amazing unscripted show 
sandra bullock is my favorite actress but this movie was so horrible i couldn t help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that i was actually watching something so crappy ha ha the audio editing is horrible they try too hard to come up with creative camera angles because they re just weird and stupid the script sucked acting was horrible storyline not very good very unrealistic even for a movie but it is a year old movie so i ll give it a bonus point for that and yeah the music was terrible but we all got to start somewhere and submitting these things is such a hassle line minimum bother well now i know why i couldn t find this movie in the movie store i had to purchase it offline to see it good thing it was only cents even though shipping was oh well i don t recommend anyone wasting their time and money seeing this film 
i have just read what i believe to be an analysis of this film by a lyrical irishman lovely to read however a concise analysis of this film is that it is a interweaving of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice envy greed pride sloth anger etc and justice in the forms of retributive distributive blind and divine i could demonstrate three examples of each one for each of the three protagonists however it is much more fun to note them for oneself this is an excellent film don t miss it 
many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of the man who knew too much which i have not had the opportunity to view by itself the version is a very well done film the run of mid to late fifties hitchcock films including rear window dial m for murder vertigo and to catch a thief as well as this film is one of my favorite periods in his career in the man who knew too much jimmy stewart throws himself vigorously into his role as always doris day is very believable in the role of an atypical hitchcock blond i thought there was nothing fake about her performance her character may not have been written as strongly as the original but she s definitely not reduced to the role of a passive yes dear pretty thing on jimmy stewart s arm there were some really clever lines written for hank the couple s son who later gets kidnapped in the opening scene on the bus it s too bad christopher olsen read them so woodenly it s rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the s though most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent though most notably the assassin played by reggie nalder some little touches that make this film undeniably hitchcockian the use of non english dialog especially french something hitch did on a much larger scale in to catch a thief the use of foreboding arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears stewart and day talking to each other in the church singing their words to the tune of the hymn the albert hall scene specifically showing the musicians and the assassin s accomplice following the score building up tension as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready and finally the assassin s gun as it appears from behind the curtain it moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically an effect hitch used at the end of spellbound also all in all the man who knew too much is a fun film to watch it s not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films vertigo strangers on a train but all the same it is one of my top five hitchcock masterpieces 
a superman cartoon a huge shipment of gold is being sent across country by train using ultra modern techniques a sophisticated gang of hooded thieves try to waylay the gold with intrepid reporter lois lane as the only passenger on board it s superman to the rescue but now that it s become a runaway train can even he stop the billion dollar limited this was another in the series of excellent cartoons max fleischer produced for paramount studio they feature great animation and taut fast moving plots meant to be shown in movie theaters they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts 
sublime perfect profound a true lesson on the idealized meaning of life we get completely caught up in the life journeys of martina and phillipa and babette their yearnings desires sacrifices resonant long after the movie has ended seeing it years ago as it was gaining a great deal of notoriety at the audaciousness of its subject matter half the movie being a single dinner the audience was oohing and aahing as some of the courses took their final glorious shape laughing at the reaction of the diners as they became totally seduced by the gustatorial pleasures being introduced to them by babette and being totally surprised at the turn of events at the end of the film subsequently seeing the film years later after my own twists and turns of life i realized just how profound the film is on this viewing tears flowed freely the film s meditation on the passage of time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life and love and art and generosity is truly something to cherish 
it s as if the stay puffed marshmallow man from ghostbusters had been reincarnated in rutger hauer s body and is taking revenge upon a rival s pregnant wife if seeing an obese hauer chase a very pregnant isabel glaser imagine the spine tingling thrills in that contest sounds good to you see this film seriously if hauer is what an iraqi pow looks like after six years in prison then hungry people everywhere should make a bee line to a jail in baghdad overall tactical assault rates stars instead of because mike mitchell as hawk is terrific mitchell burns up the screen as a nato pilot until his plane is burned up itself by an enemy missle whereupon the film loses what little verve it had to begin with 
how awful is it let me count the ways it is a bait and switch movie that starts out being about a ufo investigation then turns into a high pressure sales job for christianity c mon if the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message why disguise it it annoys non believers and pushes fence sitters in the opposite direction it s not even a good sales pitch if the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them i d run like hell in the opposite direction they re scary the acting is terrible they all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace the cinematography is home movie bad wait actually its not even that good script bad bad bad all dialogue no action like a tennis match they bounce back and forth between the talking head close ups direction what direction oh there must have been a director there somewhere i challenge you to figure out where believe it or not i have some positive comments about this movie the editing seemed professional but couldn t make a difference a good edit of bad material is still a bad movie the opening theme music was actually very good very scary and ufo ish too bad the movie wasn t about ufos if you can t tell already here s the bottom line i wasted my money seeing this movie and it made me angry if they had not disguised what this movie was really about i could say it was my fault 
a wonderful cast thrown into modern mystical romances for the intellectual grown ups yes they too need a love story to stir those hidden urges without the hollywood fluff this all under the masterful direction of antonioni and wenders who both love to pin his characters in exotic locations and have them dwarfed by the surroundings with long wide shots it is great to see that there is lust in the mid life crises sector 
the andrew davies adaptation of the sarah waters novel was excellent the characters of nan and and kitty were superbly portrayed by rachael stirling and kelley hawes respectively the whole series was a total joy to watch it caught the imagination of everyone across the board whether straight or gay i wish there could be a sequel 
in my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash however the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band i recognized the music as being a band called firstryke and the album was just a nightmare and it was very well written and i am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it if can remember back that far i would appreciate the feed back i collect old movie and obscure movie sound tracks it is a very time consuming hobby but is very rewarding i have seen this bands music being sold in germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album not to bad hugh 
when a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes in a small texas town people start to die the county sheriff tries to investigate but is hampered in his efforts by other government officials it turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla on the loose killing teenagers in the woods i like low budget science fiction and horror movies i like monster movies so i thought that there would be a good chance that i would like this movie sadly i didn t i don t mind the bad acting the corny dialog the atrocious musical score or the giant plot holes that this movie has there are a lot of movies that have the same problems that i have seen and enjoyed in a so bad it s good kind of way but where others of that type and night fright differ is that night fright just has terrible pacing and it drags on because of that there are scenes that just go on and on without anything happening the searching the woods for clues is just people walking in the forest for a long time there are several seemingly endless dancing teens at a party in the woods but nothing interesting is going on if these scenes were shorter the movie might not have been as boring though i don t think simply cutting those scenes would save this one i have now given this movie three viewings to make sure that i gave it a chance before slamming it in this review sadly it has gotten worse with each watch there won t be a fourth 
i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it what s great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the cinematography and the beautiful cast the story is non existent for sure but with these movies it doesn t really matter the pace in languid and the settings are exotic the film has a lot going for it unfortunately it also has a few things going against it the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability according to imdb al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous there s one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i ve ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross dresser the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter in mid air and al cliver is filming all of this with his mm camera i kid you not ridiculous we later see that mm footage being edited on a moviola while the footage rolls al and annie start making out this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much watching the footage of the cross dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman while piloting a helicopter no less al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn t so silly speaking of drag another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and his two wives a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex in fact orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film even when he s with annie belle this is another minor complaint about laure there s nudity but it s not as much as other films of the same era it just needed more skin to punch it up except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments laure is actually very watchable i love these kind of softcore films from the s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere not the crude stuff we see today p s make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt which stars annie al but also another famous screen couple laura gemser and gabriele tinti the music in that movie is also great 
i rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club you know those hip cool places you might stumble upon late on a saturday night well there s not one ounce of cool in this ridiculous movie the score is goofy the original songs are awful both lead actors singing is continually off key to be kind and unprofessional at best the plot is no more complex than boy meets girl the acting is laughable and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes the jazz club scenes feature sophomoric dialog smothered by overly busy organ music this joey de francesco should keep his day job unless his day job is helping with movie scores is it possible to not only get my four dollars back but have my therapy sessions paid for as well this movie interestingly enough is so bad you might want to watch it sort of like driving by a bad accident you just have to look at least once just get the ear plugs ready 
this movie is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work paul sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players that against all odds took home the championship years ago they have all met for a reunion terry kinney plays james a junior high principal and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for me role vincent d onofrio as phil plays an obnoxious businessman with just the right amount of money cockiness tony shalhoub is george the current mayor of the town and appears to be on the verge of some sort of breakdown gary sinise plays tom a writer turned alcoholic and in my opinion is excellent in the role while they are all suppose to be celebrating their championship conflicts jealousy and fighting abound as the men come to terms with what was and is now they are forced to look at their lives in a non pleasant way it s unusual to have a group of men talking and crying about what could have been and i found it interesting watching them relate to each other it s not the best movie i ve seen but it s certainly good enough for a viewing 
certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics which is one reason you should never pay attention to them this film is a perfect example the critics like director eric rohmer this movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager pauline she s taking care of for the summer and the relationships they have with a few men it s talk talk talk and more talk for those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless french morality play a friend of mine loaned me this tape he thought he was getting some sexy french film and was disappointed i was just as disappointed because it also was so boring how this gets such great reviews is almost unfathomable 
journalist bob woodward s blistering scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor john belushi s rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie a nebulous fantasy directed by larry peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital michael chiklis years before his breakthrough on the shield is put in the unenviable position of portraying belushi taking a post mortem trip through his life recreating those saturday night live skits which are now part of tv history it s like watching someone try to out lucy lucille ball it can t be done the reason why there was such sorrow at belushi s death was because he was one of a kind chiklis makes a commendable attempt at looking the part and he s funny in an early scene trying to escape from the morgue still it s an uphill venture and no actor no matter how talented could have saved it from 
fun story of a regular guy with big dreams this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success great performances by lou myers and brian s neighbor alex i giggled alot and even cried a little 
significant spoilers this is a sick disturbing movie just like the sick twisted director jennifer chambers lynch who also wrote it i don t even know why i gave this movie a rating of it is not the fault of the actors for sure the cast certainly portrayed their roles well it is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind i do know that i will never ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch she is a sick twisted foul mouthed foul thinking deviant she looks speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs who spent years doing hard time you can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the dvd special features section of surveillance the watched are watching you can see and hear her for yourself she was every bit as bad as i had envisioned from the writing of this movie i m not shocked by bad language although this director certainly talks like a sailor this goes far beyond simple bad language worse than any p rn film the level of implied sado violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p rn standards this perverse disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says another reviewer found the description i was seeking this is a snuff film be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending this director writer is truly a sick person i can t believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie much less pay her for it you can be assured that i will never ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with in the thousands of movies i have watched and collected there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott she is offensive beyond anyone i have ever seen connected with filming a movie before there have been some bad directors and writers but none could compare to her sick twisted mind when i saw this movie which was just one murder rampage after another once it got past the hotel murder then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks the vacation family with the bad parents who had no business being in the presence of children followed by the drug addicts the movie then proceeded to the even more twisted deviant serial killers as i saw the serial killers reveal themselves i began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie those were my actual thoughts as i watched this movie i fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long term psychiatric treatment to my surprise it turned out to be the director when i saw and heard what she had to say on the dvd i realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose on the dvd she was indeed the sick twisted person i had envisioned writing such a disturbing film while the little girl stephanie ryan simpkins truly stole the show i can t believe that her real life parents would have tolerated this sick foul mouthed director to be anywhere near their daughter this movie is disturbing sick offensive twisted and the director writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility as far as the ending of the movie goes the alternate ending should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal there was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character i m stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie the trailer was completely misleading the only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer that trailer is not representative of the movie you will see other than the child every character in this movie was a sick murderous twisted perverse violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer director who created them but if you watch it carefully even the parents of the vacationing family the sick cops taking pot shots the serial killers posing in alternate roles cops in the station and even the station dispatcher every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually twisted violent pervert i m not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the canadian town in the special features section of the dvd this writer director has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps the only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child watch closely and you will see this in every character then listen to the director writer talk on the dvd special features section and you will understand what i m telling you about her mental state and psychological issues she wouldn t be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a hollywood film making family fortunately jennifer chambers lynch does not have much of a filmography less than a handful of things since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles i don t think we ll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad director david lynch helps her out i d recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with and i m not too sure her dad s films would be any better do yourself a favor avoid anything written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch 
lonesome jim is kind of like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers both boys around living at home with absolutely nothing going for them i live in the midwest and i can t name one family like this i picked it up because i kind of like buscemi acting humor now i realize i need to have a counteracting agent to that humor to make it work the acting and camera work and editing was fine the first minutes got you set and the last minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing jerry springer trailer trash type of story the female members of my family were begging me to turn it off but i prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end and we watched the entire movie the male family members as expected simply walked out after the first minutes 
this western was set in and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by western union while nice guy dean jagger sporting lots of hair did his best to get this done there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons so it s up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the day this is certainly one of the better s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an it was that good however for the life of me i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this film after all he knew nothing about westerns his forte was drama and i guess this movie is a drama of sorts just set in the old west strange yes but it seemed to work out okay though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job as for the rest of the film it s exceptional with vivid color great location shooting and very good acting as usual randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance i was surprised though with robert young being also cast in the film but it was a good casting decision he was supposed to be a harvard educated easterner when i saw barton maclane was also in the film i pretty much assumed he d be the baddie and my thoughts were well founded since he made a career out of playing jerks as for the script it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part but the final showdown between scott and barton maclane was a lot better than i d hoped making this movie ending on a very high note 
that s how i was when i walked staggered out of this film i couldn t leave because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people i was stuck in the middle trapped the tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen the daughter was a stand out performance stand out in the bad sense thge cinematography was hideous consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting i ve witnessed as for the stock footage well at first one wait why am i reviewing this film why do i acknowledge its existence please don t watch it do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry 
the first season was great good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home it was actually a pretty funny show now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone and the whole thing revolves around the airline company even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill way too over the top where before it was perfect that and no more sarah mason one of the best looking girls in hollywood this is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show you can almost see the meeting the old man is funny lets focus on him make him way over the top and make it all about the airline it ll be a nutty version of the office anyhow no hot chicks no watch 
just as ted kramer dustin hoffman is about to get a break in his professional life his frustrated wife joanna meryl streep finally gets up the courage to leave him leaving ted to care for their five year old son justin henry being a single parent proves to be quite the chore for ted and he suffers professionally but also learns there s much more to life than a career as he continues to bond with and really get to know his own son but then joanna returns and intends to get her son back which leads to a cruel custody trial kramer vs kramer is a superbly well written and magnificently acted human drama that will only leave the most cold hearted a viewer untouched hoffman s growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out it always feels very real and thanks to the film s low key approach it makes even more of an impact and can easily work upon multiple viewings the film s dramatic impact does not lessen easily recommended out of 
having read the books and seen the anthony andrews jane seymour version i have to say that this is not good at all according to the books percy is supposed to be a seemingly foppish aristocrat when he s being percy and witty and clever when he s being the pimpernel but here he just looks bored as percy and mean as the pimpernel marguerite is supposed to be the most beautiful woman in europe not a tired and frumpy looking matron she looks middle aged probably due to bad make up richard e grant has done much better things and elizabeth mcgovern s acting is uninspired and flat the wit and dash of the books and the andrews seymour film is here replaced by brawn and flashy editing that just don t make the cut i might add that to a person who hasn t seen any previous version or read the book it would probably look ok 
i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i recently found the prey in its original vhs big box form and was very excited i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic the prey is one of those films to be fair it started off ok with the killer stalking the clich teenagers in the woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch this film is basically a big fat clich and when the campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the back story of the killer i actually thought this was quite an original idea however the back story ends abruptly and shows us some stock footage of a burning woodland the lack of budget really starts to show now after this we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isn t shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer sort of like cropsy from the burning but better as for gore there isn t too much although there s an ok face squishing moment at the end overall i wouldn t recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists it really is a big mess 
everything about this movie was bad the acting was bad and the plot was bad and were is all the blood and gore that was in demons which is a good movie and it was not scary at all my brother said that this movie was bad but i had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good when the movie was over i understand why my brother thought this movie was bad the only plus in this movie was the music by the smiths and the cult but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing and i saw that it has been released four sequels after this film i haven t seen none of them but can they be as awful as this one i have no plans to see them but maybe i will see them some time 
perhaps this movie was meant to be nothing but funny maybe it was meant to get teenage boys excited at all the nudity in it but what i got out of it was actually something that many people believe in and that is nice guys finish last there is a line in angel heart from lisa bonet s character that says it takes a bad ass to make a girls heart beat faster true most likely women always say that they want the flowers and the candy and politeness and whatever but at least at an early age they end up going for the good looking slimy disrespectful untamed guy the one they know they can t conform to their beliefs and that is part of the attraction after all what is exciting about a guy that is already the way you want him to be i believe this may have happened to boaz davidson and what he has to say in this film that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything else that teens can relate to is that you will get your heart broken it happens to everyone and it will happen to you and that is a strong final statement in the film but having said all that the movie is fun it is funny and it shows the antics of highschoolers quite well this is a rare film that is sleezy enough to please the teenage crowd it caters to but also intelligent and poignant enough to show what it s like to get your heart broken no highschool film has ever done this better like i said i think the writers must have experienced a situation like this first hand maybe we all have this is an old film but if you ever come across it gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night pick it up you may be surprised it is a hell of a lot better than never been kissed 
this film is amazing while not perfect by hollywood standards it encompasses a gentle look at the wide divide between rich and poor black and white that is true in many parts of the world it handles the audience with kid gloves while delivering a truthful look at societal problems the children are beautiful take special note of the young man who plays sipho the friendships that develop are universally true anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make the influence of adults is interesting it appears to be taken from real life experiences as there are snip its of conversations and interactions much like a child would remember experiencing i would highly recommend this film 
if you speak french or can put up with sub titles you will really enjoy this movie if on the other hand you just want to see god s most beautiful creatures this is a must see not an ounce of silicon in sight zalman king eat your heart out sophie marceau s body is the epitome of perfection and everything i had ever fantasized about her part is even in english even the fact that she was nude with john malkovich did not detract for her beauty sophie is a ten if ever there was one chiara caselli and in s sastre are s oh yeah it is a pretty good story several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of six degrees of separation style 
one word for it hilarious i haven t watched at movie like this in a long time at points in the movie i totally forgot it was a movie i just felt like i was back watching viva la bam or even watching say my own friend going through something like this it was realistic and i liked how bam ryan raab rake and brandon and the rest of the guys didn t try to hard too actually act they to me were just acting like their famous idiot selves there were a few scenes that i adored more than others like raab in the shower holy i laughed so hard he honestly was probably my favourite character besides bam s he really in my opinion made the movie just a bit more hilarious it s basically a must see for any fans of the cky crew ]
it s not unusual that hollywood likes to pump out crappy films occasionally a handful of good films come out of them while the majority just sucks major ass it s also not surprising that those bad films are retreads of old tv series occasionally a surprise pops up with the fugitive who saw that best picture oscar nom coming but for every fugitive there s a mchale s navy or some other wholly unoriginal film devoid of any plot or interest the mod squad in my opinion goes into my top ten of truly lousy films in which hollywood should get it s sorry ass beaten for producing what could ve been a good movie we re shifted right dab smack in the middle of a story that just doesn t seem to make sense it wastes the talent and the dialogue is just bad we don t actually know who the hell these characters are and we could give a flying f k about what they are instead you re expected to automatically know who they are and what they re going to do there s one particularly bad riff about the i m too old for this s t line that s just plain stupid something my friend verbally noted when we were clamoring for the movie to just end it s just an insult to hollywood cinema grade f 
great historical movie will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch view is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject my only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white wished it had been in color wow 
this movie was so heart warming a true testament to an actors real life everyday ups and downs it was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen this film is a reminder to everyone to go for there dreams never give up hurray for the stand in 
this movie doesn t even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good it is truly appalling its closer to a tongue in cheek parody than a disaster movie but alas they were serious made for tv but not worthy of even that it contains every clich and cheesy plot moment you can imagine oh will he save the town from the flood will his wife admit that she still loves him will they escape before the flood drowns them i cant explain how bad this is awful predictable plot that makes you wince it is so cheesy bad effects although to be fair i have seen worse super imposed bubbling water bad script woeful acting hideous so bad in fact that you probably should get drunk and watch it 
this film is a study piece for my english class but it s depth and meaning has amazed me since we re looking closely into all the facts and characters in this film its and interesting tale of love hate war and prejudice well recommended story a girl named well off jewish patty bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war she then hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens and as they get to know each other they begin to see the others qualities and they earn each others love patty s father despises her and treats her like dirt anton the prisoner of war almost blows his cover to protect her but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone 
wow just wow there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to add some comments of my own i agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and directing whoo boy does it ever however i think there is some other problems here why is christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive the film acts as though you just can t be a christian and also allow for the possibility why they ever so briefly touch on this in the film i e the bible doesn t say there is aliens well the bible doesn t say there isn t but the actual rebuttal is never answered the bible really doesn t say there isn t so how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand or better yet acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite god there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them how come the only two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax what about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences what if it s something else entirely too bad the film makers already have their minds made up the film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult that s a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present i m not necessarily arguing that they don t but if you re going to say something so asinine you d better have the facts to back it up why does the other reporter not the greasy haired blonde guy the other one always have his hands in his pockets it s hard to take someone seriously when they re constantly playing pocket pool i wish this had been an exploration of christian faith and ufo phenomena but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their faith message to care much about make a thought provoking movie as a christian myself this saddens me 
i rented this film courtesy of netflix thinking i would receive the version i sat clueless watching this new version thinking gee the production values were spectacular i was convinced the soundtrack had a slightly s sound to it i was even more convinced that this was a s film when it occurred to me almost every five seconds that the one thing that was missing between gene and finney was an intense hug a loaded stare a passionate kiss i m sorry although john knowles himself has indicated that this was not a homosexual relationship it is painfully obvious that yes that s exactly what it was when people usually adolescents of the same sex have intense friendships it means that those longings for love togetherness the desire to express oneself sexually are all spilling over these boys needed to connect but they were never allowed to also despite a spirited performance by toby moore i never felt any of the emotions were real i never connected to either of the boys for the very reason their relationship was not truly honest people want to live in a fantasy and think that because this took place in the s that these boys couldn t have had these sexual feelings for each other but i say they did at least in the book they did and in this movie finney had them almost painfully for gene the intensity that john knowles suggests existed between them was a closet homosexuality a hero worship an idolatry that would under normal circumstances be expressed in a sexual way even if these boys were repressing it it should have been crystal clear but this movie doesn t even really hint at it lastly there is an unbelievably bizarre moment when finney who has broken his leg is playfully jumped on by all the other boys during a ball game unless they were just a bunch of nincompoops they would know they could not possibly throw their bodies against him obviously this bone shattering moment was lost on both the director and the producer 
i have never read sarah water s book although i have not read the book the hour movie is very interesting it begins with an interesting storyline with a twisted ending i have to say these actresses are amazing sally hawkins is stunning successfully portrayed the character in love with her mistress and betrayed by her love their romance slowly blossoms as they spend more and more time together the love making scene is very tender and emotional well acted the end is quite intriguing and these ended up together after all they have been thru which is a bless overall it is a great movie to see a very interesting plot with excellent performances 
one of the best western movies ever made unfortunately it never got the recognition it deserved the storyline the action and the music was in my mind one of the best i give it a double a randolph scott gave a terrific performance along with the other members of the cast the ending was one of the best of any western made 
joan cusack steals the show the premise is good the plot line interesting and the screenplay was ok a tad too simplistic in that a coming out story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not quite so positive then again it is fiction all in all an entertaining romp one thing i noticed was the inside joke aspect since the target audience probably was straight they may not get the gay stuff in context with the story kevin kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that screenwriters sometimes don t take in consideration when suggesting kline for a part this one hit the mark 
ok i read the director s comment about this movie featured as the frontmost comment and i have to admit that i can identify with his position micheal i hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other better things i ve seen this movie in the mst k form even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots i saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it and this is one of those films mitchell is another where the mst k crew took a lot of cheap shots at the lead character even when she actually deserved better you know they had some unfair fun at the actress expense because it made for a livelier episode imo the fact that the movie actually tried to be about something and had a few decent effective moments here and there should keep it out of the bottom tangents time chasers is another movie with a plot and a heart that doesn t deserve to be there either but it is still not a very good movie i don t blame the writer lead actress for being who she is it s just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could pull off a vanity project such as this or carry a feature film the writing and characterization is amateurish and slapdash and the dialog is often barely up to abc afterschool special standards the cast sincerely gives it their best effort and the acting in general is definitely head and shoulders above abortions like future war or space mutiny but there aren t any really professional level performances here with the exception of big joe estevez who is hammy but suitably intense i never saw the full original cut but mst s sampling of soultaker was representative enough to make these facts plain oh and the film has robert z dar in it that is imo a real kiss of death for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously yes he s big and scary looking in his role but i just hate the guy as an actor in real life i wish him well and hope he is financially comfortable there were little things i liked about the film for instance the camaraderie between the male lead and his dead buddy added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it a lot more watchable the idea of an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some spooky vibes without springing for special effects and i respected whoever worked that into the script in attempt to keep the budget manageable it didn t really work but it might have with just a little more tweaking so anyway mr rissi better luck with your other projects your involvement with this misfire wouldn t keep me from watching something else you did if the buzz was good and ms miller has nothing to be ashamed of she was young and ambitious and the movie wasn t that bad 
life was going great for new york city advertising artist ted kramer he had a great job and a loving wife no actually his wife wasn t so loving for when ted returned home late from work that night his wife joanna had a suit case packed and was heading out the door he tried to stop her but she just got into the elevator and out of ted s life well now in addition to his job he s now got to mind the house as well as their year old son billy ted assured his boss that his wife s leaving would not affect his job performance in any way it did however affect his performance as a father he blew up when billy spilled punch on his client artwork well some time later ted and billy receive a letter from joanna and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn t coming back ted was distraught well he was late coming home from work on billy s birthday which made billy sore at him ted was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting when he got home he yelled at billy for sneaking ice cream during dinner then later he truthfully told billy that the break up between he and joanna may have been his fault not billy s ted invited a good friend phyllis bernard over that night and well billy got his first look at a naked woman when ted took billy to the park the following day he fell off the jungle gym and landed face first onto his toy plane ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches after that life began taking a downward spiral for ted then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than joanna they met in a corner caf at first they have a pleasant conversation but then joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her ted would have none of it and stormed out well life got even worse for ted when his boss jim o connor took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him not only that but joanna was choosing to sue for custody of billy and without a job ted didn t stand a chance in hell for winning he hired himself a lawyer john shaunessy who charged a pretty penny exact change and that s if they win ted was also able to find a new job it was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination finally the court date january arrived judge atkins presiding joanna took the stand and shaunessy proceeded to question her about why she left ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures the next day ted took the stand and joanna s lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger ted s good friend margaret took the stand as well and she really didn t help matters well the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough one day shaunessy informs ted that he lost joanna got sole custody of billy how typical always ruling in favor of the mother well ted and billy were just devastated about parting ways they had a tearful goodbye when suddenly joanna stopped by she and ted have a little talk and well rather than just give away the ending let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody this was a very good movie dustin hoffman was very good he earned that academy award i ve also seen him in hook meet the fockers and rain man which he also won an oscar for meryl streep was good she also got an oscar justin henry was good too so where was his nomination i guess the academy had a rule against giving oscars to children but the rule was lifted when haley joel osment came along this movie has great drama light comedy and is very subtle it does a good job of holding your attention i was watching rain man on tcm the other night then this came on after and i just couldn t help but watch and that s what you should do if you like dustin hoffman or meryl streep or movies of this genre then i recommend kramer vs kramer a gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child i liked ted s little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time what was it about sex that makes a good parents actually that s how they have the child but seriously he s right why always rule in favor of the mother because she s a woman also in the cast george coe howard duff who passed away in and howland chamberlain who passed away in watch for an up and coming jobeth williams in the nudity in the hallway scene anyway see kramer vs kramer today good movie 
a by the numbers exorcism exercise with a disappointing non allegiance and usage of the term blackwater the cinematography appears right out of basic cable mow land which removes any semblance of swampy murky atmosphere from the proceedings in addition there s not nearly enough gore sex or attractive young things to satiate the majority of the film s targeted viewers that being said the lead actress who plays the possessed has a sexy olive skinned presence what else needs to be said about this non winner don t rent unless you ve got a thing for middle aged adults bemoaning their past and rants with clich d priests shrinks hispanic stablemen all regretting their past actions 
it takes an eternity for this typically over simplistic and idiotic stephen king based film to finally get out of the starting blocks about half an hour is spent on needless introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that might excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soapy dramas but this is supposed to be the horror genre or so i naively thought the mutt fails to look all that fearsome which leonard maltin the notoriously clueless hopeless and always grinning film critic would disagree with he considers cujo to be genuinely frightening i often do have to wonder if maltin is genuinely thick or merely likes to do favors for his hollywood friends it s both illogical and inconsistent the way wallace survives an attack with only a leg injury and naturally her car breaks down just when she needs it to save her life this is one of the oldest horror film clich s trust king to use it to minimum effect the premise is imbecilic too banal even for a horror film a rabid mutt attacks a family is that it this sort of thing barely constitutes a minute sub sub plot in your average zombie film i think even cujo must have sensed that he was starring in a turkey mutts have terrible agents but what i really don t understand is how people can actually throw themselves at the cujo book and read it from cover to cover these sk fans must be immortal that s the only explanation i e why they treat time as such a meaningless commodity bodycount 
watching john cassavetes debut film is a strange experience even if you ve seen improvisational films before the first thing you notice is it s roughness right off it s obvious some of the characters are screwing up their lines but then you step back from the situation as you sink deeper into these people s intimate exchanges and you ask yourself do i ever stumble over my words the answer of course is sure we all do it s unfortunate that most of the gaffes in this respect come early in the picture because by about twenty minutes you ve sunk so deep in you wouldn t know it if a bomb went off behind you the next thing you notice or maybe you notice it hours or days after the film ends is that you never saw any substantial plot yet the themes and the poetry of the dialog and characters never leave you in fact the treatment of the role race plays in the everyday lives of these characters is always there but it s so ephemeral that even they aren t aware of how it s informing their opinions of themselves their self consciousness their perceived status or the fate of their relationships the title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of blacks whites and grays and not just in the skin pigmentation of the characters leila goldoni truly remarkable here is an afro american caucasian her two brothers are white and dark afro american the irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the hippest most tolerant atmosphere of the time beat driven upper east west manhatten and there are still conflicts within and around themselves i don t think i ve ever seen a movie with such a subtle delivery or technique it s a lot like absorbing a really great piece of gallery art and then just nodding off in bliss as you think back to the images it evoked days later great mastering and extras on the criterion disc arguably the first truly experimental independent film ever made 
how unfortunate yet also fortunate that two films about pot holing the cave and the descent should arrive at much the same time sadly for the descent its release in the uk on th of july coincided with the very day of the london underground tube metro terrorist atrocity that killed almost and injured hundreds not a particularly good night weekend to pop out to the cinema especially to see a scary as sheesh film about likable women being trapped in a deep dark claustrophobic underground caving system the two movies have virtually the same elements a half dozen or so characters lost in a previously unexplored caving system with no one outside aware they are trapped down there lots of water caverns danger then ultimately some vicious human like or human derived creatures determined to prey upon them where the two are so different is that the cave is unreal entirely unbelievable more alien esquire sci fi fantasy adventure than horror or drama the comparatively minuscule budgeted british film filmed in southern england though set in the appalachians is five pair of pants terrifying a heart stopping shocker so stomach turning that people walk out of screenings early in shock it knocks off the girls in any old order you genuinely have no idea what to expect next surely not her the descent is also lit in naturalistic manner making it all the more scary unlike the laughably lit cave which resembles a giant magical christmas santa s grotto with cathedral sized room after room dazzling in gloriously blue light from who knows where while the cavers torches are employed exclusively in artistically lighting up the granite jawed heroes each more puppet like than any team america gerry anderson thunderbirds creation fantastic amounts of equipment are carried too yet despite this the impossibly deep voiced actors clearly forgot to pack any sense of impending danger drama or anything worthy of a horror film it s strictly pg rated and in this instance the actors peg out in exactly the order that everyone expects them to i quickly wrote a list after being introduced to each character only getting piper perabo out of sequence the cave script is entirely by numbers unlike shakespeare a room full of chimpanzees would eventually write it in under a week take a typical exchange between the good buddy white and black leads that goes how many times have we been in this situation before bud too many replies morris chesnut i swear you could hear my suburban london audience gasp at the obviousness the scariest thing about the cave is that at the end there s a clear opening for the sequel the cave overground or whatever be afraid be very afraid or instead catch the descent and be truly afraid very very very afraid rr
there is no fun poking fun at the desperate plight of illegal immigrants or the desperate plight of head shop owners for that matter that the richer than god brian glazer didn t see the irony of having the heroes do exactly what the villain does rob honest hardworking people of their life savings doesn t surprise me hell how do you think he got to be richer than god in this alleged satire about greed these mental midgets reveal their own hypocrisy the mcmansions the mctoys the mcchildren the mcillegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the mcmansions the mctoys and the mcchildren but the main problem aside from the revolting bigotry is the premise as the former executive of a now infamous company dick would be the big scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country no soup kitchens for him and raking in high six figures you d think he wouldn t be caught dead around a gore lieberman poster 
i for one absolutely loved this movie it is not a typical asian horror where you would see a gruesome looking ghost usually a woman that is going around scaring people you barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius this is not the movie for you if you re into gore e g saw hostel or surprise scares where stuff pops out at you hollywood horror slasher films but this movie has an underlying creepy factor throughout the entire movie which i loved noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by hollywood in today s society please don t let the documentary style of filming turn you off why should it it is far superior to the blair witch project because for one the acting in noroi is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like you re watching something you re not supposed to be seeing noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies i have ever seen only a few films have made it into my top horror and this movie holds a solid spot on my list 
all right i ll grant you that some of the science in doppelganger or journey to the far side of the sun is kind of dopey the idea of an entire planet existing undetected because we can t see it on the other side of our sun doesn t hold up at all any astronomy student knows that another planet the size of earth would cause gravitational perturbances in the motions of other planets that s how astronomers deduced the existence of pluto after all and that s how they find comets and asteroids and moons on a regular basis and the idea that a mirror image earth somehow evolved in almost perfect parallel to our earth down to english speaking scientists and human counterparts for each human born on our earth that takes things out of hard science fiction and into twilight zone territory that s not necessarily a bad thing but it requires a major suspension of critical thinking to accept and enjoy but man this movie knocked my socks off as an adolescent i was still used to fairly cheerful upbeat science fiction films when the hero won through in the end even could be interpreted as having an upbeat ending but in this case thinnes attempted to dock with his orbiting mothership so he could return to his own earth only to be bounced back out of his docking berth something about the polarities not being reversed because his doppelganger wasn t doing the same thing apparently thinnes doppelganger had decided he was happy in his new home thinnes ship started the descent back to the counterearth launch site and i was certain that he would somehow get the damaged craft to land safely and try again armed with the new info that would let him and his backers succeed he was the hero after all and the hero always wins through in the end instead thinnes couldn t maintain control of the crippled craft and the ship s subsequent crash into the launch site was so horrible and devastating that it killed everyone except for the chief project leader and destroyed all records of the project and thinnes existence thinnes never got to go home and he perished uselessly his secrets never revealed except for the planet of the apes series i had never seen such a sad and downbeat ending and it always stuck in my mind especially the ferocious devastation of the crash scene near the beginning of the move you knew that spaceship was never going to fly again and the one at the very end i d love to see this movie again and see how well it held up over the years 
 man i just cant believe this movie i have watched it entirely believe me i have done this and the best part was the traillers on the beginning and i hate traillers no plot no acting no nothing i was watching the movie and thinking when this is going to start it never started how people can spend money and time to make such a crap the plot a dog gets bitten by a bat and get rabies okay until now no problem nothing special but ok now the rest of the movie will be the dog will chase people thats it nothing else now add to this some of the worse actings actors i have ever seem some completely irrealistic scenes and some others really idiotic like the child cant breath and the mother gives him a big and strong hug to see if he gets better and a very lame ending thats it here you have crap ops cujo do your self a favor and make something more worthy like hiting your head against the wall or play chess with yourself zero out of gabriel 
i rented this movie because the cover was cool looking the first minutes of the movie are okay and somehow interesting but once the young woman and her little sister go on their trip everything goes to hell and the movie becomes boring 
if you re a film student or were one or are thinking of becoming one the name battleship potemkin has or will have a resonance sergei eistenstein like other silent film pioneers like griffith although eisenstein s innovations are not as commonplace as griffith s and murnau has had such an impact on the history of cinema it s of course taken for granted the reason i bring up the film student part is because at some point whether you d like it or not your film professor times out of will show the odessa stairs sequence of this film it s hard to say if it s even the best part of the film s several sequences dealing with the at the time current times of the russian revolution but it does leave the most impact and it can be seen in many films showcasing suspense or just plain montage the untouchables climax comes to mind montage which was not just eistenstein s knack but also his life s blood early in his career is often misused in the present cinema or if not misused then in an improper context for the story sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point a to point b montage was something else for eisenstein he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency the passion s and the ultimate tragedies that were in the russian people at the time and place even if one doesn t see all of eisenstein s narrative or traditional story ideas to have much grounding kubrick has said this one can t deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor the people on the stairs and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns some may find it hard to believe this was done in the s it has that power like the passion of joan of arc to over pass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion of course one could go on for books which have been written hundreds of times over not the least of which by eisenstein himself on the film in and of itself battleship potemkin is really more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie the first segment is also one of the great sequences in film as a mutiny is plotted against the captain and other head ups of a certain ship this is detailed almost in a manipulative way but somehow extremely effective montage is used here as well but in spurts of energy that capture the eye other times eisenstein is more content to just let the images speak for themselves as the soldiers grow weary without food and water he isn t one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story he is of course very much early th century russian but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style and that is what wins over in the end some may want to check it outside of film school as the stairs sequence is like one of those landmarks of severe tragedy on film displaying the ugly side of revolution eisenstein may not be one of the more accessible silent film directors but if montage detail in the frame non actors and bolshevik themes are your cup of tea it s truly one of the must sees of a lifetime 
if not the best movie ever made babette s feast is certainly among the most loving this is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of artistry generosity loyalty and grace humor is mixed with tender longing characters are treated with searching honesty but also deep respect there are meditations here on memory fate old age and faithfulness marvellous camera work by cinematographer henning kristiansen seldom have wrinkled faces looked so luminous in the candle light the meal is accompanied by delicious period music brahms mozart and simple folk hymns enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit for as the general says mercy and truth have met together and righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another 
i m glad i read the sarah waters novel first since i had my own pictures of the characters in my head at the time the ones cast for this production however were not at all disappointing in fact after i got used to rachael stirling as nan i think nina gold did a damn fine job in the casting department can keeley hawes be more delicious the bbc has done it again this is a wonderful production of a very good book and they have done it up in style if you can get your hands on this vhs dvd be sure to get the minute version the uncensored one it is a marvelous journey albeit a bit rocky at times that you won t regret taking 
now this is more like it one of the best movies i have ever seen despite it made very well on all aspects this movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurate loosen up there are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grand how entertaining and how captivating this movie was now this is what a movie ticket is all about you will get exacty what you want from this movie s genre and all naysayers are those with the anti flynn syndrome this conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the anti elvis anti ali anti clinton anti kennedy syndromes usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs if the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art you will find this movie not only one of the best classics but also one of the best movies of all time i rate it the second best western ever right behind wayne s the cowboys 
now i like the bollywood films and i m very glad they have recently gained success in the uk however suneel darshan s latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finish the idea of a modern bollywood take on amadeus was quite an exciting one that is until the two supposed musicians appear on the scene looking as if they have never touched a piece of manuscript in their lives upen patel is a very good looking man and the film plays to his narcissistic sensibilities but he is never once believable as a modern mozart in terms of acting all he can do is stand there and pout his expressions hair and clothes all look the same throughout including the scene where he is supposedly dying when in fact he appears to have nothing but a slight sniffle bobby deol playing the salieri role does his best to liven up what little wooden script there is but alas just comes across as a little bit angry when he is supposed to be fuming with jealousy bollywood films are widely renowned for their stunning set pieces and colour schemes but shaklaka looks like a drab bbc drama reproduction in fact the closest thing shakalaka comes to is hollyoaks as it blatantly hides a really bad script behind beautiful people looking well beautiful he has yet to reach mediocrity the same could be said for the totally forgetful songs in short darshan s latest offering has no boom bang wallop or twang instead it merely plods along with its head held low hoping to catch your attention with a soft tap on the shoulder and that is not good enough at all 
low budget horror movie if you don t raise your expectations too high you ll probably enjoy this little flick beginning and end are pretty good middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot quite a bit of gore i enjoyed bill mcghee s performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture he managed to carry the movie at times when nothing much seemed to be happening nurse charlotte beale played by jesse lee played her character well so be prepared to want to slap her toward the end she makes some really stupid mistakes but then that s what makes these low budget movies so good i would have been out of that place and five states away long before she even considered that it might be a good idea to leave if you enjoy this movie try committed from which is basically a rip off of this movie 
radio will have you laughing crying feeling this story based on a true story is the perfect movie for a couple to view there s enough for both cuba gooding jr portrays the title character to perfection his performance is worthy of an academy award nomination the compassion of the movie is obvious the movie evokes many emotions i sincerely enjoyed this film 
its perhaps unfair of me to comment on this film because for the first time ever i switched off a movie because it was so bad i can watch anything but this movie was so very boring i was bored before i put on the dvd and thought this might be a laughable action horror action movie to lighten the mood it is not even that it is a device which increases the level of boredom by the power of had to switch it off after minutes because all that had happened in that time was some people had been scuba diving and a big mole had been discovered seriously this movie is not worth the time even if you can enjoy a bad movie like i can avoid this film like the plague worst thing i have seen in years 
it s hard to believe that oprah winfrey produced this piece of junk the show couldn t even hold a candle to cooking shows of the past including emeril lagasse rachael ray is the most annoying talk show and cooking show host in tv history not since ainsley harriott has had a terrible cooking show host i ve watched at least ainsley harriott has some good moments and some style this one has no style at all she s terrible as host the kitchen looks atrocious the writing is horrible the teleplay is over the top and the opening credits are so bad it makes me sick now i enjoy cooking shows that had a cool sense of style but this has absolutely none of that this is one of the worst tv of the year 
is the cannes controversy meter remarkably esoteric or is that we americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore be that as it may with plenty of careful analyzing falscher bekenner at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to cannes in a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it s glum american re title low profile building on familiar themes of bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation kind of admittedly it s a film not without it s surface level interests it starts out with a grabber as a haunting shot of a desolate off the highway road focuses in on a teenage drifter who ultimately walks by a totaled car where supposedly a brutal hit and run has left the driver dead in a gory mess stunned he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining engine just out of school the drifter turns out to be armin steebe a product of the german suburbs with minimal ambition persisentily pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it every one with the same fruitless outcome getting mighty sick of it his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown as the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if he s doing nothing out of the ordinary if you seem confused about what exactly is going on don t worry about being the only one this is about as far and coherent as the story gets the plot seems simple enough and perhaps due to it s seemingly direct purposes that s why falscher bekenner becomes pointlessly convoluted becoming enamored with endless false conclusions dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument supposedly the soul numbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland or something about youth s fascination with crime hey it could even be a coming out movie at hand it spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols both tangible and surrealistically allegorical but they don t seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest the most fatal flaw however is how the filmmakers paint all it s characters in a rough shade of vanilla there s hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose and how the secondary characters especially the confused relationship between armin and his rather normal perhaps too normal family catalyze the already under developed lead character s plight never comes into focus how are we supposed to identify with this young almost adult s rebellion with little sense of the world he s living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it many people drop in and out of the movie including armin s sort of girlfriend katja and a strange affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat brownies and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever they ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next and even a movie that supposedly toys with reality especially with armin s nightly exploits it ends with a literal almost moralizing head scratcher that seems to halt questions to a story that does little but put it s viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted perplexion without any color it s impossible to shade anything vital in 
i think that the movie was really good subject acting and nusrat fateh ali khan s music were marvellous although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male dominated culture he has neglected phoolan s character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her 
looking for a real super bad movie if you wanna have great fun don t hesitate and check this one ferrigno is incredibly bad but is also the best of this mediocrity 
southern cross written and directed by james becket is a waste of good celluloid and actor s efforts a formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it s promise which this film does not it is a tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be traced to a thousand different films from the past it is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action such as a trip by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains unexplainedly follow them this was obviously concocted as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other it makes one believe that somebody told becket there was a ghost town in the chilean foothills and he said oh great lets do a shoot out scene there don t even waste your rental money on this it is a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama 
i saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful it was pointless and just plain stupid the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life he disappears on his wedding day in a tux no less and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos we saw it with a bus load of people on the way down to atlantic city and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie it was trying to be profound but it wasn t it was stupid and offensive if i wasn t on a bus i would have walked out on the movie anyone considering seeing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been forewarned 
i first saw this film in the theater way back in the s when i was a kid and always remembered the ending there is nothing like the first impression but some movies are always a treat each time they are viewed something just resonates with them this is one of those films and i agree with another reviewer who said fritz lang should have directed more westerns to add to it i have always liked randolph scott and robert young in fact robert young stars in what i consider my favorite movie if i have to name just one not an easy thing to do that film is northwest passage it led me to the superb historical novels of kenneth roberts western union likewise led me to reading zane grey s novel which in this case turned out to be one of those rare cases where i like the movie better than the novel not that grey s novel is a bad one i just like the movie story better the movie in no way resembles the novel it is a completely different tale one of the biggest departures from a book i have seen i can t add much to the other reviews except to say i agree with many of them i too wish it would be released on dvd whatever happened to randolph scott happened to the best of me 
the child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit it was a pretty weak field for best picture that year i think apocalypse now should have taken it but the academy probably felt it was too violent and strange plus vietnam was still too recent meryl streep was tremendous as always playing a very unlikeable character i don t usually compliment directors but i really liked that bit with the elevator doors grade b
i guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in new york operates but i d be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muffled sound recording on display here the fact that these inherent defects were a direct result of the film s low budget underground experimental nature is i d say beside the point anyway for those so inclined the film features extensive male nudity and joe dallesandro understandably became an underground and gay icon the episodic structure showing the day to day routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes his meeting with and eventually posing for an eccentric elderly artist the one where dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective colleagues including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers a bespectacled nerd perhaps mercifully the film ran for only minutes against the imdb s claim that its complete length is but the latter could well be a mistake i had watched a few other of warhol s movies and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example i ve run into yet bad and only slightly better than the likes of my hustler which were mostly a strain to sit through the fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not augur well but as the saying goes you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two chapters had to follow in quick succession despite my generally negative reaction to it flesh is nevertheless still valuable as a s time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era both cinematically and in real life for the record an image of dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of the smiths self titled debut album and transsexual candy darling who appears here rather unremarkably was immortalized in candy says the opening track of the velvet underground s eponymous album although the latter band is my all time favorite and one of the reasons for this is that through their sheerly unique and ground breaking music they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own this is truly a case where i d much rather experience something aurally instead of visually 
i watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it on so many people s favourite episodes list i m not boasting in any way but from the start i realised they were in some sort of toybox can with the huge eye looking down on them to the type of characters in there even though throughout the episode the questions of who are we where are we what s outside carry the suspense of the episode which i unfortunately already figured out i must say that different types of characters and the interaction between them did make the episode interesting enough although the twist of the story may have been harder to guess if all of them were toy soldiers 
i watched the first episode and i found it to be a very wooden performance i have watched the original from it s early days on big girls blouse to the last series on channel seven kath and kim was a great mocumentary and it s humor is something that most people get however in this american version i found it to be dull molly shannon is to fashionable to be kath day kath s wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the s with her frizzy perm while selma blair s figure hugging clothes isn t as good as what the original kimmy wore i also found that selma seemed to be puffing her belly out a lot she is obviously a australian size where kim should be australian a size the exchanges from molly and selma is obviously so scripted and there is pauses where there shouldn t be pauses or the pauses are a bit long as someone suggested there could be a laughter track in there during those pauses it s like molly and shannon are not used to each other there is no mother daughter chemistry phil was okay he had the eccentric air around him like kel however craig was to handsome and not the sweet plain humble brett from the aussie version i found watching this was like watching a very bad stage play the acting was pretty much wooden and the exaggeration of selma s expressions wore the funny off after ten minutes especially her sulking scenes to sum up i find this show to be a waste of time the script obviously has been dumbed down for americans which most on the board say they prefer the original if nbc wanted to show kath and kim why not pay the producers the money to screen the original all i can add is magda you are one smart cookie for not letting the producers use your character of sharon 
this short is one of the best of all time and is proof just like most of charlie chaplin s work that sound and color are not requirements for quality work in fact this cartoon uses and may have started some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years like caricatures of celebrities including the afore mentioned chaplin while the characters are silent they do speak by use of word balloons just like in the comics given that felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip this device is a natural the atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension literally and figuratively and makes this short a delight to watch well worth taking the time and effort to get most highly recommended 
i m not sure if this is a comedy or not but i found it pretty comical isobel is possessed by the devil somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna fix that part exorcism and part soap opera you ll at least get some laughs there s the paranoid jealous dad satanic sister valley of the dolls mother and then the cowboy boyfriend all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear isobel it sometimes felt like a jerry springer episode but i actually paid to see this instead of the cool head twisting sailor cursing and crucifix humping that regan did in the exorcist you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it s a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hay loft yeah it s chuck e cheese gone wild so if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending this is your movie 
i just saw a tale of two sisters last night and really enjoyed it i ve been a big fan of asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from south korea there aren t many jump out at you scares as in the usual american horror film but the director does maintain the off kilter and foreboding mood very well especially in the awkward character interactions with each other most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone s there s something under the bed fears from when they were a child but in this case it s the closet and the sink i also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together he s also good at revealing people s inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering tv i think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you major spoilers ahead do not read any further if you do not want the twists of the movie revealed i was following the story pretty well but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part however i think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together the film is very much like the machinist in the way two of the character s joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions here s my interpretation of the film the su yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of su mi or the actual ghost of su yeon that only su mi can see and interact with the initial stepmother that we see is in my opinion a delusion of su mi there is a real stepmother however and she first appears in the film when she s wearing the gray pantsuit i believe it s the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn t appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house the stepmother before that point is imagined by su mi perhaps part of her split personality that explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother s brother looks at her like she s crazy and doesn t remember anything that she recounts i think it was su mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality the film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make up in the mirror which is revealed later to actually be su mi wiping her make up in the mirror i think the ghosts in the house aren t entirely imagined by su mi and are either of su yeon or the mother or both in the final flashback it is revealed the su yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died this is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink also it s the hairpin that su yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink the real stepmother in the end gets punished by the ghost of su yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like the ring after that the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death while su mi unintentionally played a supporting role i wonder if the mother that su yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry in the flashback is a ghost already perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet that s left ambiguous other things that are suggested but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother at some point was a nurse perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too it s not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself it s also suggested that the mother had mental issues too requiring a nurse the stepmother alludes to this when she tells su mi you re beginning to take after your mother i don t think she meant just physically also if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually su mi then there s the suggestion of incest too since the father sleeps with her is that why su mi freaks out and shouts don t touch me each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes is that the filthy things that you ve done that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father this film is interesting in it s capacity for different interpretations a few of the scenes however were kind of derivative such as the woman in the black crawling around scene which reminded me of the herky jerky movements of kayako in the ju on the grudge films also the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of the ring furthermore just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from the sixth sense or the others overall i enjoyed it however and it will be interesting to see how the hollywood remake that s already in production turns out i have to be honest i liked both the ring and the grudge so i m not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can t be good too one remake that i m really excited about is dark water coming out this summer i haven t seen the original japanese version yet but both films are definitely on my to see list 
it is fascinating how this title manages to slip by the average viewer as something new and groundbreaking quoting some of the comments murali k thalluri must have thought by himself oh great elephant what a fantastic movie i ll try hard to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices sadly enough he even failed with his outrageous idea the movie turns out a complete failure considering that it tries hard to catch the brilliance of gus van sants elephant it makes it look even more ridiculous a most embarrassing faux pas for a film director the movie starts off with the suicide of a student in the schools bathroom this scene already shows the awkward acting skills of each one involved in this scene you don t buy a single word they say in carries on interrupted by short interview styled bits of the kids who live on their marry lives with each bit rather distressing in its plain stupidity on the basis of each worthless monologue thalluri means to introduce the characters this way to give a kind of fast as junk food insight look into their hearts and fails once again not five minutes later thalluri ultimately screams at the audience yes people i stole this movie and for some curious reason i am proud of it by taking gus van sants most unmistakable narrative style from elephant he shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene on his particular way and role in a school situation hm doesn t this seem awfully familiar to me this certain level of very forgiving tolerance had been infringed right there to a point at which i couldn t stand this dreadful movie any more shame on you murali k thalluri i say i am especially surprised that has reached the official selections in cannes as of whereas everyone must have certainly remembered elephant at the very same film festival just a few years ago so how in the name of the lord did this most disgraceful rip off end up being shown there i find myself absolutely puzzled by this mistake directors like thalluri use the ignorance of audiences who aren t and cannot completely be aware of every independent film out there as elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema although it is without a doubt a masterpiece few people notice that the story as told in had been told before how that is possible at a film festival of such importance as attributed to cannes i cannot say it is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the true fraud in it is by all means solely commercial worthless as an independent film and on a certain level rather a phoney parody of its obvious idol elephant 
my take steven seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller even a totally dull one remember steven seagal you don t don t worry there s not much to catch up on after starring in admittedly enjoyable crowd pleasing films like under siege and executive decision seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie abyss now he stars in low budgeted b level action vehicles some of which are made for tv movie of the week entries that lost their way to the big screen half past dead is among these shall we say dead action movies a loud and lousy action film sloppily directed and lazily written and worse badly acted this is one of those bad movies that i don t need to watch until the ending to know it s bad i didn t have the guts to have all my braincells die while wasting my time with this it it this kind of bad films in which you realize those other films you hate are not bad after all the plot and the locale is completely lifted from a similar picture michael bay s the rock although similar may not be the word to describe it both movies are summer movies and not meant to be taken so seriously but in comparison even the rock which isn t much in the writing department as much as the lights and sounds has better characters a more compelling plot better action sequences and overall a more entertaining atmosphere although there are action scenes in half past dead none of them are exciting all of which are sometimes tedious and predictable although predictability seemed to be a welcome asset in summer action films predictability has never tasted more sour in ones that aren t fun and half past dead is never really fun a lot of times it s just a pain in the head hearing the bad rap music repeat over and over again throughout this film makes me yearn for an aspirin every second i hear them the acting is horrendously mediocre the plot is derivative with no compelling or appealing characters whatsoever seagal s character an undercover agent sent to alcatraz to stop a criminal mastermind morris chestnut a very boring villain is nothing to get excited about seagal s character is also provided with a sidekick played by rap star ja rule and a bunch of amigo inmates and there s no chemistry going on here if starring in a series of other forgotten action vehicles what were those films again killed of seagal s career for good half past dead is overkill and audiences be warned you re invited to feel the pain advice avoid it at all costs rating out of 
a gem of a cartoon from the silent era it was re discovered by cartoon network and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades if ever what makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos douglas fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos will hays pays a visit as boss of static studios as well as appearances by chaplin keaton and william s hart the image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace a money making idea for felix s near bankrupt shoe salesman boss cannot be described it must be viewed a terrific cultural gem 
fun with dick and jane failed to entertain on so many levels there were loose ends with the writing for example it seems as though one of the major conflicts was the indictment of jim carrey s character dick harper but the writers never follow up that particular conflict basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny but carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor but honestly jim carrey wasn t very funny in this movie and tea leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn t funny either this is just another example of hollywood banking off franchise actors with a lousy unoriginal story 
three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men the three businessmen take revenge which escalates to a murder after another supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people the plot has too many holes the details were ignored in order to move the story forward the acting was uneven the color balance was awful even though i watched this movie in dvd the small budget and tight schedule were apparent the whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight and the ending was just unbelievable 
carole lombard stars in this transition period film this film is a typical example of a very early talkie first practical sound film was the jazz singer overall the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic the viewer may easily note that the actors are still acting for a silent film and this combined with the overly pronounced overly earnest dialog it seems most likely a diction elocution drama coach was employed extensively to teach the silent actors to speak lines creates some rather comical scenes which were not at all intended to be comical carole lombard s later great acting ability is all but unrecognizable underneath all the broad gestures melodrama and eager earnestness mainly interesting as an historical curiosity of the period and for it s completely unintended comedy camp value 
for those of you looking for the crazy stunts that typified a harold lloyd silent comedy this is not the film for you what the cat s paw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for lloyd who was trying to establish himself in sound for me the closest movie comparison to lloyd s character is that of peter sellers in being there for all the education that lloyd has received in dealing with the world he might as well have been brought up in isolation as sellers was but where he was brought up was as a missionary s child in china and i don t know how much christianity he and his family were able to teach the chinese but young harold has learned the wisdom of chinese philosopher lin po whom he quotes constantly like a fortune cookie aphorism as it turns out lin po turns out to be one wise dude anyway lloyd s father samuel s hinds has decided his son needs some education in the modern world of th century america and he sends him back to be the guest of the pastor of the home church which sponsors the mission the pastor there is the perennial candidate of the reform movement of that town of stockport but no sooner does lloyd arrive and the pastor dies now the reform movement is a sham and the pastor a patsy of the political bosses who need a straw man opponent in every election they decide lloyd just might be a better patsy than the guy who just died of course as it goes in these type of films the patsy proves to be not so easy a proposition in fact lloyd constantly quoting from lin po the way charlie chan used to dispense wisdom proves quite the adversary for the crooks who run stockport in addition lloyd gains the admiration of una merkel as cynical a dame as jean arthur was in mr deeds and mr smith the cat s paw is still a nice political satire though it did not establish harold lloyd as big a comedy name as he was in silent films a nice cast of players was selected by director sam taylor topped by george barbier who plays a political boss who discovers lloyd and actually proves to have a streak of honesty in him 
my wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store from the cover it looked like a science fiction film but upon turning it over my wife saw rebecca st james was in the film realized it was a christian movie and suggested we watch it we are conservative evangelicals but we also know that christian films have a poor reputation in the mainstream nevertheless we decided to give it a screening to be fair there were a few things i liked about the film the musical score much of which was orchestrated was quite good the cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower budget movie unfortunately any virtue in this film s production work was lost on a regrettable script the film begins with an interesting premise ufo abductions but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie s two main characters which then veers wildly into a treatise on the rapture at least the frank peretti inspired the visitation which was itself a deeply flawed film had an endgame that tied together the movie s premise unidentified ends nowhere even close to where it started which is a huge letdown as for the acting the supporting acting ranges from decent to awful rebecca st james plays a bit part and is passable for their part a few of the main characters are manned capably enough sadly their talents are wasted on characters so one dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable the protagonists are anything but you know it s bad when two christian viewers find the most vocal christian character in the film to be the most annoying a final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie which will be of more interest to christian than non christian readers in a word it is embarrassing other christian films like carmen s the champion and peretti s the hangman s curse have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive this film by contrast is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy handed and lacking in tact that a non christian would have a hard time taking it seriously i do believe that the filmmaker s heart is in the right place and i applaud efforts to create good christian film unfortunately this is not one of them if your church is looking for a screening of a good christian film consider mercy streets the aforementioned the champion or if you re pentecostal robert duvall s provocative the apostle as for unidentified rent it if you must but screen it before you show it to a non christian or a larger audience 
this conglomeration fails so miserably on every level that it is difficult to decide what to say it doesn t merit one line much less ten but to adhere to the rules of imdb here goes and i probably won t succeed the first time around and have to type some more to make up for this submission to be accepted lol if i had seen this schlock during the s while i was going through my mushroom phase i would have still considered it unimaginative and shallow the most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door opened and closed i was on the edge of my seat one person on here wrote that he had met the creator of this mess as if that were a red letter day in his life one can only pray that something far more exciting occurs in that posters life get a grip amigo 
for those of you still in the dark i will not spoil this christie as it is definitely one of her finest works and i stress that you should see it whenever you next have free time if any of the adaptations are to be watched before or in lieu of reading the book i would suggest after the funeral for the following reasons i wanted to praise the performance by monica dolan miss gilchrist whose employer companion cora is brutally murdered at the outset of the film her portrayal of a shocked nervous insignificant woman is actually moving especially when she has a moment of personal connection with poirot another person who travels alone in the journey of life and when the murderer is being revealed in typical poirot denouement fashion dolan s reactions to the revelation are acting at its finest you feel as angry at the murderer as you do sympathetic to miss gilchrist something uncommon in christie lore although there are a couple of discrepancies between novel and film adaptation as per usual the business of the will perhaps making less sense in the film the unbelievably lavish recreation of post war england thoroughly high calibre of acting and directing and preservation if not heightening of christie s mystery and intrigue render these discrepancies insignificant bravo suchet dolan and the whole team for crafting this masterpiece of murder mystery theatre and the producers who gave it the green light encore 
when i watched l appartement with my girlfriend she sighed how complicated and she is right of course when you are used to simple one linear plots especially violent hero vs crook schemes l appartement is hard to follow a couple of the negative reviewers here also have missed one or more important points other whine about the confusing flash backs come on this is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet come back and get hooked again within a few seconds this one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details then it is really not that hard to figure out what s happening and when the director has left more than enough clues in all scenes the first of the movie centers about the question why did max and lisa split the film as my girlfriend remarked begins as a romantic lovestory suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again having experience with french movies i predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and i was right in the end of the first part it becomes clear after many twists and turns that max and lisa were manipulated by alice max did not know that lisa had left and why lisa did not know why max did not contact her in rome and left her without a trace when she returned to paris the only one who did was alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut after both max and lisa have found out the truth the question of course becomes can alice s manipulations be undone well of course not time has passed by and things have changed many european movies use a story telling technique i fully enjoy there is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning after which two or more interested parties try to decide in their own advantage instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters l appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique in the first half alice seems to be a side character slowly it becomes clear that she is key figure acting is simply great vincent cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past monica belucci is very beautiful of course but also competent jean paul ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch romane bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman plagued by feelings of guilt and regret the only reason i did not gave it a is the somewhat unsatisfying end of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry after all the events max is exactly on the point where the movie begun only wiser and sadder alice has paid for her sins but still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial max too easily exchanges lisa for alice alice too easily decides to reject max who has been her dream for so long max too easily returns to his fianc e but then again i don t know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry i guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty 
 all i can do with this film is improvise on my impressions i wasn t given the changes don t know the score and am not schooled in the genre i always had problems following chord changes anyway trumpet player y know so i was pretty well limited to doing the basic keep the tune in mind and ad lib around that what jammed me up about this incredibly moody black and white blues piece was the knot it gave me in my head and heart in trying to figure out whether to go with the ensemble or pick out a path along the tune story i guess i went with the tune as usual i kept getting lost on the changes too deep extensive over my head probably still it was a gas to try to keep pace i admired the actors playing to the theme and story line i didn t see some things or heare things others seem to i didn t feel the light skin gal was trying to pass as much as she was either oblivious to the color issue or was trying to ignore it at first later she came back fighting the brooding light skin young man his trumpet noodling mas ludicrous was ambiguous ambivalent and perhaps his best feature remote what i thought after the shadow curtain closed on this provocative piece is the foundation of a thing like this is it a way of finding reality by setting up a stage peopling it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and theme is it any more real or truthful than a well crafted script without the benefit of editing and revising is improvisation heroic artier moreso than crafted work where is there greater or clearer truth in retrospective art craft or in fabrication and reformation well i am still lost in this question i loved the film it got me lost in a cool blue foggy evening where i just had to go home and get out my horn guess what i broke out in a twelve bar blues riff tried and true couldn t make myself stray from the tune reality is just too scary jaime says give them a and more i m on break 
i kid you not yes who s that girl has the distinction for being one in a string of madonna s films that bombed but i actually liked this movie more than desperately seeking susan in susan madonna s character is relegated to being second fiddle to rosanna arquette and is not given much to work with no disrespect to rosanna but in wtg madonna plays this zany outrageous character only done in an s style while it may seem cheesy today this is actually one of madonna s best and one of her most underrated films madonna plays nikki finn an ex con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didn t commit she s being released from jail after four years of good behavior griffin dunne who is also a very underrated actor plays louden trott a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station of course when these two get together that s when the madness happens sir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a rainforest on his roof this movie parodies everything rich people the sleazy characters who live in harlem and totally destroy louden s rolls royce the gay cops who follow madonna and dunne around town and dunne s stuck up fiance wendy worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in new york city played by haviland morris who was jake s girlfriend caroline in sixteen candles hilarious plus dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of bringing up baby plus madonna had a great platinum blonde s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of wtg madonna is the queen of deadpan acting there are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly it turns out to be funny that s how some of the best comedy should be played straight madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark sexually charged roles in the notorious movies body of evidence and dangerous game some people say madonna cannot act and that is fine people are entitled to their opinion but i believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between madonna playing a character on film instead they still see only madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies it s still a fun screwball comedy of the s not for everyone i m sure some of you will dislike it so i would recommend it mainly for madonna fans but you never know you might be surprised and like it interesting note one of madonna s friends from her early s new york club days coati mundi who plays raoul was a member in the bands kid creole and the coconuts and savannah band 
rented this one by mistake thinking it was another film with the same title and realizing that i had rented it some time before quick plot line a couple consisting of an artist and photographer rent a studio apartment in los angeles from joe estevez still cursing the fact his brother martin sheen could actually act they find a bed in a forgotten room but the bed is haunted by a nasty looking serial killer from the s and his last victim their ghosts inhabit the couple first enhancing their sex life but eventually becoming more menacing what ensues is cheap r rated sex scenes cheaper thrills and kind of a waste of time 
given the acting roles he played in the s casper gutman signior ferrari mr peters jerome k arbutny ex superintendent grodman count fosco titus semple it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally sidney greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the west end and broadway he was usually such a total villain or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored in fact he actually did make four comedy appearances one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner peter lorre in a cameo appearance his best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher alexander yardley in christmas in connecticut although his autocratic half mad soap tycoon in the hucksters is a close second despite some problems with the screenplay it is a good film and usually revived in the christmas season elizabeth lane barbara stanwyck writes a column in american housekeeping magazine for yardley where she gives household tips and cooking recipes she is the version of martha steward except that ms steward is a cook and house owner and can vouch for trying out and testing what she advocates stanwyck can t her cooking recipes are those of her friend felix s z sakall a gourmet chef and restaurateur the house she describes as her home a model farmhouse in connecticut belongs to her unofficial boyfriend architect john sloan reginald gardiner gardiner really would not mind marrying stanwyck but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to him as the film begins an american is shipwrecked by the nazis this is jefferson jones dennis morgan a sailor he spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued sensing publicity value greenstreet decides to grant morgan s wish to have a genuine old fashioned christmas in connecticut he basically tells stanwyck that she will entertain morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays stanwyck is unable to explain that the columns image of herself complete with her ability to flip flap jacks and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband is a lie if she does she will be fired as will her immediate boss dudley beecham robert shayne in a moment of depression she accepts gardiner s proposal of marriage and then gardiner finds his connecticut home is dragooned into becoming the actual home of stanwyck and himself and their baby of course aside from putting off greenstreet s meddling curiosity stanwyck and morgan find that they are falling in love much to the annoyance of gardiner he does actually expect that stanwyck will still marry him complication following complication occurs as lies piles on lies and as neighbor s babies succeeds neighbor s babies before greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something but it is a comedy so everything works out well even greenstreet at the conclusion is amused by the entire madness his celebrated hearty chortle mirroring that of santa clause for a change this is not a classic comedy certainly not a great one but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in december 
nightkill stars robert mitchum as a world weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist mike connors he is hired by jaclyn smith the anxious wife of the missing man what jaclyn fails to inform mitchum is that she knows full well her husband s whereabouts after all she was the one who helped her lover james franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby what more would expect from a rotten slasher film with robert mitchum mannix goes western monkeys are abused models lean against classic cars and smith is constantly upstaged by sybil danning until a giallo style wrap up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end this is bad cinema and this movie is sooooo poor it makes it look like halloween mixed up with trick or treats avoid this rated r for graphic violence nudity and sexual situations 
 spoiler warning i seem to keep giving this guy his last chance strange how an action hero who once was keeps attracting an audience anyway this movie is about a character seagal being kind of a mysterious rough neck hero that s it next 
in the nd of his historical martial arts films chiba portrays his real life sensei mas oyama the film even recreates oyama s incredible feat of killing a raging bull with his bare hands oyama did this feat over times in real life dynamic fight choreography featuring authentic kyokushinkai techniques ironically this is one of the rare sonny chiba films in which he doesn t tear out or rip off body parts of opponents a must see for sonny chiba fans definitely one of his top films
this movie is so good i first seen it when i was six then i bought it recently and i still love it im now plus the acting was great and madonna is my idol and she did a phat job alot of people didnt like this movie and i still to this day dont understand why 
okay to be fair this movie did have an interesting concept given a few script rewrites some decent actors and a budget this might have been a fairly decent cult flick instead of the mst k fodder it turned out to be still it was better than armageddon 
i adore the ln chaney version of phantom and i appreciate webber s version if only for the growing interest in the book wish i find more of a mystery slash horror with the romantic aspects downplayed i don t approve of the fact that andrew lloyd webber made the relationship between raoul and christine less restrained luckily since this is a comedic short with only erik and christine this version doesn t even have to bother with any other characters i thought i would still be waiting for another version to match up lon s performance i was dead wrong leslie nielson is fabulous as erik though of course this is a spoof it s still brilliant i especially appreciated the fact that erik looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim i still have as of yet to see a phantom like that other than lon s however i do not recommend this short if you don t like spoofs because this is in no way supposed to be taken seriously 
the mission to see the movie the cave was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave some young cave divers and not much else it s too bad that the movie didn t change much more than the trailer did the immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature what s he going to look like why does he live in a cave how is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we ve been shown in movies like alien and predator and the relic the cave demons do not look far from the skeletal creature in alien resurrection and even has the sight of predator shame that s a total ripoff well let s look at the plot very confusing and jumps to more and more totally improbable twists as a team of cave divers is sent to find a cave and its dwellers in the carpathian mountains the casting was very much clear that we want young hip tough chicks chiseled guys and the girls who have brains also have to be hot we also have to have one of every racial background in case the audience thinks that the film makers are biased to a certain viewpoint totally been done and i m totally tired of it the other main problem was the ending as if to say there might be a sequel plase shoot me if there is one the tagged on ending made me wretch i gave this movie stars the points that it did get were more or less appreciation points towards the creature builders for their high quality job spent on the costuming and design for the monsters who dwell within even when they looked totally ripped off and there s an interesting yet labored documentary on the dvd on underwater cave diving go check it out only if you love new creations of monsters and creatures but be warned that you ve probably seen this movie before and it was better the first time 
if you re looking for an original horror flick this might be the one for you it s strange and at times lingers on stupidity but it s just such a good looking nice sounding and original movie it never fails except maybe during the over long climax nightbreed is a must see for horror fans or for fans of monster movie make up boone craig sheffer has been having dreams of a town called midian full of mutant creatures in therapy his psychiatrist dr decker horror director david cronenberg has come to the conclusion that boone is a murderer and gives him hallucinogenic pills and tells him to turn himself in after almost getting killed boone ends up at the hospital where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about midian and tells boone where to go midian located in a graveyard is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that don t let boone in after escaping with only a nasty bite boone is shot dead by the police who were lead to his location by dr decker but boone isn t dead the bite causes him to live and he goes off to midian meanwhile boone s girlfriend lori anne bobby tries to find boone and get to the bottom of this when dr decker also finds out about this place chaos ensues the plot seems long and complicated but it really isn t hard to understand the plot among other things makes this movie really interesting the make up effects are astounding the creatures look unique and amazing and make this a very appealing film to add to more senses appeal we have a musical score by danny elfman that is both lush and bouncy and fits the film like a glove the shots in the movie are also set up beautifully the cinematography is lovely and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken even the acting is good with the biggest surprise being director david cronenberg giving a great menacing performance as the man who for one reason or another wants to see boone dead it s odd for a horror film to be this well done the problems with the movie well there are a few but the positives outweigh the negatives the script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor but almost every one falls flat the mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera the worst part of the film would have to be the climax it takes so long and is just constant chaos it s the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we don t know or care about overall this movie is amazing to look at it s a well done horror film but even with that said it has the occasional failure in character s lines and a messy climax nonetheless this is one to check out my rating out of mins r for strong violence and language 
radio was a very good movie and honestly i never cry in movies but it had me pretty close to tears it really got to me when radio s mom died and he just wouldn t get out of his room i felt really sad about how if you were mentally retarded you wouldn t really be able to understand death i really liked the movie and it s a must see 
while watching blackwater valley exorcism i encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that i was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy a few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh i ate a rabbit i told you she was possessed are you telling me the devil is in my daughter there are many many more but you must discover these for yourself if you dare the story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn t and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort even the priest and i haven t even gotten to the bad acting most notable in this area is the fellow playing isabelle s father the director must have just told him to act like he s got a stick up his because that s the general impression one gets i don t really want to steer anyone away from blackwater valley exorcism because there is entertainment value to be had for all the wrong reasons but if you re looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is actually scary well run don t walk 
a gem from japan where so many of the world s best films are being made today stylistically this isn t anything all that special it s just a simple drama with some comic overtones about recognizable people going about their lives yuko tanaka best known for voicing the character lady eboshi in princess mononoke plays a year old spinster she s takes pride in her health spending each morning in a vigorous workout as she delivers milk up and down the steep hills of nagasaki after she is done with this part time job she works her regular job as a clerk at a grocery store called s mart which made this army of darkness fan giggle along her milk route lives a year old man whose wife is dying it turns out the milk woman and the man a child services worker dated in high school and each apparently still have something of a crush on the other the film actually has some major narrative problems when the screenwriter actually wants the two unrequited lovers to unite he uses a pretty unbelievable deus ex machina technique the climactic sequence is also really forced but most of the film is beautifully small and observant of the two main characters as well as many side characters the film also has several subplots that seem like they will eventually weigh the film down but never end up doing so i think the best thing in the film is tanaka s heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life whatever the problems were the film mostly transcends them 
 are you in the house alone belongs to the pre cable tv days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular tv shows it is well made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations kathleen beller plays a high school student who gets a series of threatening letters everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but beller is really scared tony bill and blythe danner play beller s parents ellen travolta john s sister is the high school principal and dennis quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid it s a competent chiller with a still relevant social message beller is lovely if you are or older you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters blythe danner who i usually don t like gives a truly moving performance nice little film 
mixing small town sheriffs high school students fake rock music and some weirdo who kills for well no reason in particular this film is essentially a re make of the giant gila monster except without the gila monster of course now anyone who has actually seen giant gila monster knows that it is one of the worst made films of all time frequently so slow it s not even funny and i can t believe that by giant gila monster had earned such a reputation that young directors were just dying to get to work on a sequel let alone a remake so will someone please explain to me why this film was made the dance sequence by the way is historically interesting although about three years out of date but even that s spoiled since it goes on and on and on 
there are movies that are so bad they re good then there s movies like rest stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful bad acting unlikable characters predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note i can t even bring myself to write a plot outline because all i really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie do yourself a favour and don t even bother with this film at all it s hours of your life that you will never get back 
i don t know what it is about the crew from cky but everything they produce seems to be genius in its simplicity and stupidity haggard is so incredibly dumb and funny that it s almost comedic excellence sometimes it makes absolutely no sense but who cares it made me laugh my ass off a must have for the cky jackass aficionado 
goldeneye is a masterpiece the storyline is amazingly depicted the characters beautifully animated and the weapons are tyte the storyline is so interesting even when you complete every single mission to get more levels you have to beat them on a higher difficulty and the multiplayer mode is so tyte you pick the weapons you want to play with then play me and the three of my friends along with my brother always play goldeneye if you don t have this game i suggest you buy it

all credit to writer director gilles mimouni who fashioned this winding twisting tale of deceit and betrayal while keeping the utmost control he maintains the audience at arm s length never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on even his clever denouement has you guessing the three central performances are also top class with vincent cassel romane bohringer and monica bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery jean phillippe ecoffey supplements strength in his supporting role to give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair thierry arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma and cardine biggerstaff s editing keeps the story a step ahead of us the theme from peter chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script many may say gilles mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love for me this is simply a haunting elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web only the french are capable of such tantalisation hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending monday march hoyts croydon no one does thriller quite like the french when they get it right they really get it right vincent cassell is intriguing as the deceptive max romane bohringer obsessive as the new lisa and monica bellucci is mysterious as the first lisa the plot from gilles mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires all credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot and the performances from the three leads as lucien jean phillippe ecoffey is strong and emotional friday january video
this is a cut above other movies of the genre genuinely suspenseful intelligent brilliantly acted and visually stunning yes the plot can be confusing but that s partly what makes it pack such a punch watch it twice if you can you ll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time don t be put off by the fact that this film comes from korea a country not too familiar to most western audiences while there are elements of the film that are culturally specific the underlying themes are all too universal guilt anger loss madness and retribution all of these are handled superbly by lim su jeong as su mi the lead character also worthy of particular mention is yum jung ah who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother while it has its scary moments this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it it s more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end and possibly beyond 
 opposing force [ ] wasn t as good as dr strangelove and it wasn t as good as the bridge on the river kwai heck it wasn t even as good as g i jane which is pretty sad the film revolves around a basic ethical problem in a simulated prisoner of war situation how far can you go before you start breaking the law what exactly is the law in such a situation how can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone can you intentionally inflict pain how about breaking bones mock executions sexual abuse severe blood loss real guns with bullets death somewhere between these is a really fuzzy line dividing acceptable from atrocious now what could you do if you found yourself in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality begin to vanish what could you do this movie attempts to portray this dilemma i found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in resistance training i have a brother who went through the usaf s pow training program according to him it was pretty close to the mark technically the film has a fairly good premise but it doesn t have a particularly good story i wondered if it might be based on some actual event but it became pretty apparent that it wasn t when the explosions started they must have changed scriptwriters three quarters into the film because it takes a real extreme turn and devolves into a somewhat pointless shoot em up with lots of distracting explosions i found it to have a rather unsatisfying ending again kind of pointless i m left wondering what the point of the whole thing was i m beginning to suspect there simply wasn t one it could have been much better with just a little more story to go along with the fireworks 
this series takes a classic story and makes rubbish of it robin is somehow mystified by an elk man in the forest and is embroiled in all sorts of druidism and outright satanic episodes the story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor this is barely watchable and to top all the ridiculousness they kill robin at the end of series and replace him with another actor some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is not a robin hood show if you want robin fighting in king richards name against prince john and the sheriff and if you want robin feeding the poor and oppressed watch the classic series or the newest from the bbc 
 spoilers for some strange reason oliver stone s talk radio based on the stephen singular book talked to death and the films star eric bogosian s play about the murder of denver talk show host alan berg has never gotten the recognition that it so rightfully deserved the movie was prophetic enough to recognize the underground movement that was developing in the farm and hinterland of america a movement that spawned some seven years later the likes of an angry and disgruntled gulf war veteran timothy mcveigh who s hatred for the us governments actions in wacco texas lead to his and friend terry nichols detonation of the us federal building in oklahoma city on april that took the lives of people the worst act of terrorism on us soil up to that time the movie is as far as i know the first time that any major branch of the entertainment media mentioned and elaborated on the rural militia novel the turner diaries by the late william l pierce that has since become a chilling underground classic the turner diaries forecast a domestic and utterly disastrous terrorist attack like the oklahoma city bombing on a us government federal facility which was the fbi building in washington d c dallas radio station kgab talk show host barry champlain eric bogosian is the top rated show in the dallas listening area and is now about to go national barry get s his high rating by his razor sharp wit and abusive behavior when he s on the air taking on all comers and ducking no issues no matter how unpopular or taboo they are has gotten barry to be the most listened to as well as hated man on radio barry being a showman at heart and not thinking that his talk can lead to violence keeps up his abrasiveness to his call in listeners as his rating go up to the celling but there are those in the listening audience mostly ultra right wing types that don t take too kindly to his in your face attitude one of them decides to take matters into his on hand at barry s expense powerhouse performance by eric bogosian as the tragic barry champlain who crossed the line from entertainment to hard reality in his actions on the radio thinking that he s not that important to be sought out and murdered for his on the air opinions which is enemies dislike he found out only too late that there are those out there who are crazy enough to do to him on the outside also in the movie talk radio is a very young alic baldwin as barry s boss dan who tries to have him soften his tone but in the end goes along with his talk show style since he s killing the competition not realizing that in the end it s him that he ll end up getting killed both ellen green and leslie hope are the two women in barry s life his ex wife ellen and now lover and talk show producer laura whom barry uses to his advantage and almost ends up losing both of them at the same time the film talk radio is so far ahead of it s time that even if you watch it now in you still think that it s too disturbing to be shown to an over sensitive and delicate american public 
this is a wonderful thriller i watched many times and never can get enough of it s all about the obsessive love people have for eachother in paris un lucky coincidences false identities the music makes it really gripping there are hardly any flaws in the characters just the end is not very credible but a definite must see still 
talk radio sees a man somewhat accidentally stumble through life indeed the american dream from whatever bog standard and everyday job he has in a store to presenter of a local radio show before going right the way through to the same job only later syndicated nationwide it s a role he adopts out of his own aggression and natural mannerisms a frothing mad approach to freedom of speech as he attacks just about everyone and everything even those that often call up to agree with him or compliment him his role as a man that rants on all things good evil right wrong political religious moral and immoral is something that people seem to take to in one form that of it s entertaining and worth tuning in for but additionally on a plane of rejection and antagonism two things born out of the very things seemingly encouraged in professional working life in the western world this towards a man as he gets to the very top of his game by way of the american dream and dealing in freedom of speech as people take to a man but do anything but take to what it is he says talk radio begins with a montage of tall towering buildings in a business based area of dallas texas the skyscrapers are shot from a ow angle and tower over the viewer plus everything else in the general vicinity as this voice of one man tears through the images belting out statements and information on items as these monolithic buildings dominate out screen they are the very physical representation of capitalism while the voice of what we learn to be a radio dj is the oral representation of the free west personal speech and opinions on anything and everything stone will finish his film in the exact same manner in which he started it although the film is anything but a circular journey of any sort as the characters undergo monumental changes in both what they witness and their general livelihood rather the shots of the buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed the ideologies and ideas of a way of life exist people subscribe to them but it does them more harm than good before the re establishment that this proud way of life still exists and will continue to exist in churning out the sorts of people on display in the film until someone or something drastically changes things the dj is barry champlain a man with a radio show on a local texan station dealing with just about anything champlain s somewhat carefree attitude to some pretty explosive content is established when he flies from one call with a bigoted man whom recently visited a holocaust museum to a young drug addict whose girlfriend has supposedly overdosed and onto both the berating and mocking of a pizza shop to us the content comes across as quite shocking to these people everything seems to be business as usual which plants some serious seeds of both doubt and horror within the minds of us the newcomers to all of this what barry s show is about nobody ever seems to really establish everything and nothing indeed time is taken in the form of either jingles or dialogue that the shows immediately pre and post champlain s show are on specific subjects gardening for instance and are hosted by calm speaking and methodical people whom i m sure do not flit from one random or extreme to another all the time raising the stakes one wonders what barry s jingle is the kind that plays around about lunch time during someone else s show coming up later the barry champlain show featuring the village idiot and psychotic drug abusers indeed his show s introductory piece carries a matter of fact tone a shouting at the audience as a loud rock track accompanies it barry s success arrives in the national syndication proposal it s born out of confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he has for his listeners and that they have for him the furthering of the material and the upping of the stakes ought to call into question just how far they think they can take this and whether this progressing down a track for sake of entertainment is really worth it it is when the show reaches this level of broadcast that barry seems to come unstuck for the first time in his broadcasting life when a supposed serial rapist calls in and leaves mostly everyone slightly stunned it s at this point the camera pauses on barry and by way of depth of focus encompasses those same looming towering buildings the film began with which stand outside of the window directly behind barry they remain tall and proud specifically of the ideologies they ve been built on and this furtherance of freedom of speech in broadening barry s show nationwide as one man climbs his profession s ladder suddenly clashes with the sort of content that s being offered everything reaches a point too far and that with freedom ought to at least come a sense of clarity rather than a mere revelling oliver stone made talk radio right in the middle of both a fascinating and explosive period of film making he had in the late s in this time he produced a series of really well received films in a pretty short space of time beginning with one of my favourite war films in platoon before continuing with the quite brilliant wall street and eventually finishing with s jfk one might even say that this run continued on into the mid nineties with natural born killers talk radio is like its lead character in the sense it s loud booming stark and confrontational it isn t anti capitalism as much as it is focused on drawing a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what is just going too far for sake of popularity and riches talk radio is certainly a film that sticks in the memory 
postwar england the dawn of the atomic age yet the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience his first kiss cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as the bomb this was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and his world of the s free of political correctness and preachy messages this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind and hormones of a young teenager can create wonderful subplots maintain character interest ala gregory s girl and plenty of well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era this is a very good story for anyone young or old who has ever been in love or ever wanted to be does he ever get his wish watch it and see 
director lead larry bishop tried way way too hard with hell ride the movie wants to be edgy witty provocative outlandish biting all of this seemingly in a quentin tarantino rob zombie style but it s not edgy the references seem forced the dialog tries to be clever and fails the humor is never funny nice try setting a gritty tone but we d have to care about the characters or the story for it to remotely succeed what you re left with are cool harleys and pretty girls surrounding a bunch of tired old and out of shape bad boys in what looks like an attempt to do a modernized sergio leone western if this movie can make newer generations interested in s and s films kudos for it but on its own it is rather boring and irrelevant i do believe there is a place for style over substance but this movie is not it 
larry bishop the writer actor director focuses too heavily on the camera music and visuals the film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience the actors experience a bumpy ride from the film s start to finish and are caught in one terrible smoke screen the hell with the ride the film is a bomb the victors are presented as weathered vigilantes who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness they are bikers anti heroes and protagonists pistolero played by larry bishop is the revengeful leader of the pack the gent michael madsen is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis comanche eric balfour is loyal but mysterious deuce performed by david carradine should have passed on the ride and so should the ticket buyers if you decide to see the film you ll be sorry but you ll find out why billy wings vinnie jones is a lewd and venomous character completely filled with disdain what puzzles me is how this film with all of its continual ramblings and vulgarity ever got anybody to invest in a ride that absolutely goes nowhere ticket buyers take my advice don t pay for the ride please don t make the same mistake as the investors the first fifteen minutes or so of the movie is confusing and unintelligible the dialog which rapidly turn into meaningless monologues doesn t make any sense the entire film is hell bent on going nowhere poor dennis hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess he too should have passed on the ride there are decapitated heads slashed throats and nude females wrestling it is clear that bishop doesn t know where he is going with the film he gets entirely lost but by the end of the ride you just won t give a damn mama mia stay home and by all means don t take the ride i rate this film a out of but this movie is so awful it deserves a zero 
this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop actually it s really just about the girl nicole since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes the movie gets going extremely fast and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length it isn t long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere the story is not only paper thin but unstructured stupid and incoherent minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop she sees the flashing of a camera and knows that people are inside but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger she walks around the rest stop doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things this includes turning on a tv and even looking amused when she thinks she s stumbled onto a porno movie even in this dire situation sitting around wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end she does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been abducted that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety she doesn t bother to lock the doors or remain alert oh yeah she tries using a radio to call for help but why even bother when there s a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop it really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the story there s no sense of entrapment or ever present danger in this story the heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her before driving off again there s nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else that s better than sitting around but she chooses to stay anyway at one point in the movie the main character even acknowledges that she can run off but doesn t the story doesn t go anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets inside the mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics they seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killer s actions but there s no indication that they re connected to him in any way and then kick nicole out after several minutes in the next irrelevant segment the main character wanders into the bathroom building she discovers one of the killer s previous victims a young woman named tracy who is still alive and locked in a closet for some strange reason tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door and when she returns a minute later both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation what was the point nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons and sees that tracy had disappeared in so was tracy a ghost or something the writer never bothers explaining next a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop which had been conveniently left unattended for the entire day so far nicole tells him all about what s been going on and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office the cop goes outside to confront him what does the police officer do knowing that something is seriously wrong he goes up and calmly talks to the killer who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killer s lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him over the cop quickly starts telling nicole that he s a goner who s lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesn t die for quite a while the two of them do some more pointless talking and the all important fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time when the two of them finally try to use the gun nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize him she fires one into his mouth and he lays still for a few moments with a chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shock nicole finally confronts the killer and fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop in the bathroom building she hears nicole crying for help in the closet locked in like tracy was she gets a policeman to go inside and check it but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet the cop leaves thinking he s been tricked a battered nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all of seconds looking apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there wow this movie is apparently the first in a new line of quality direct to dvd movies marketed as being too extreme for theaters in reality it s just more clich b movie garbage 
i rented this movie expecting it to suck and it didn t let me down i rented it with some friends as a joke but what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine it starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box it looks like a blade rip off and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie its called vampire assassin but isn t an assassin someone who kills for hire well this guy kills the of his own volition so that doesn t make him an assassin then when you actually put the disk in it gets worst first off the menu animation is lame but when you actually start the movie every thing from the set design to the lighting or lack thereof is terrible you know a movie is bad when the credits even suck the acting is laughable the action is childish the writing is elementary and the directing is the worst 
when one watches the animated superman shorts of the s the similarity of the plots can become a bit boring the adversary is most often a mad scientist in a hidden headquarter threatening metropolis with some evil invention death rays mechanical monsters electric earthquake magnetic telescope what have you this one is refreshingly different the bad ones drive around in a car shooting and bombing but the center of action is the gold train on which lois lane travels as the only press reporter it seems train movies have their own typical ingredients from the great train robbery on and quite some are featured here decoupling cars in motion running on the roofs taking the steam locomotive from the tender in the back fighting with the engineer a switch turned to deroute the train on a side track the fall of people or the whole train from a high bridge it s all in the few minutes of this lovely piece but it wouldn t be a superman film if he didn t do some incredible feats involving balancing and high precision placement to ultimately win the day if you re a fan of train movies don t miss this it s in the public domain and can be legally downloaded from archive org 
i just finished watching marigold today and i ll begin by saying that i found this dvd on the shelves of blockbuster while strolling around looking for something new and good to watch the picture of ali larter caught my attention after drooling over ali larter i picked up the cover and continued to glance around the cover from the looks of it i thought the costumes were a bit over the top and then i saw the other indians on the cover and figured this was some kind of spoof film or something like that when i flipped over the the synopsis part and saw salman khan i did a double take salman khan in an american film with ali larter in a dvd at blockbuster because salman khan is to bollywood films like mel gibson is to hollywood films i had very high expectations for this film it had to be good i am very pleased to say that marigold is a phenomenal film it far exceeded any and all of my personal expectations i suppose a film like this is what happens when you have a decent script a talented experienced knowledgeable and goal oriented director two incredible actors playing the lead roles and just a very hard working supporting cast and crew khan and larter appear to have really great chemistry together and both shine on the big screen they look really good together the musical numbers weren t bad at all which was surprising considering how cheesy and long indian films musicals are these days and you ll be happy to know that the indian costumes are very far from being cheesy as you ll get the beginning of the film was kind of slow the middle was really good the scenes leading to the climax were pretty dramatic but the ending was just awesome i have a few gripes and complaints about the dvd however while i loved the widescreen aspect ratio of the dvd i didn t like the fact that several other things were left out of the dvd for starters there are no subtitles now english being my first language it s not a problem however when some of the indian actors and actresses spoke it was at times difficult to understand what they were saying captioning would have helped another thing that i would have appreciated on the dvd would be a blooper reel or some kind of collection of outtakes and lastly how about a menu feature that would allow us to skip right to the musical numbers man some of those songs were really good on the flip side i throughly enjoyed watching the making of marigold i have tons more to say regarding the awesomeness of this film and how much i liked it but i don t have the time nor do i want to keep on writing why i enjoyed it so much i hope that salman khan does more english films in addition to his hindi films and i certainly hope this hindi film will not be ali larter s last bollywood film and i encourage the director to continue making bollywood film hybrids featuring salman khan ali larter and other big name actors just make sure the scripts are original and good this is just a great love story film that your entire family can enjoy 
sorry after watching the credits i thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring sf actors boy was i wrong the direction and story telling in this pos are terrible i have never been so insulted by a production i have great respect and love for many of the actors in this film but have to say they were conned if you haven t seen this debacle yet do yourself a favor and stay away these are not only two hours you won t get back but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed 
sure most of the slasher films of the s were not worth the celluloid they were filmed on but this video nightmare may well be the dullest produced six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping of course and you know this already they begin getting killed one by one by a mysterious stranger the climax has a hunky forest ranger trying to get to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzard bait john carl buechler my least favorite b movie guy did the lousy makeup effects here the cast features carel struycken of the witches of eastwick and the addams family movies sadly he does not pop up until the very end of the film and is covered in burn makeup rendering him unrecognizable steve bond anyone remember him is here in an early role as a victim brown s direction and the script he cowrote both smell like the presents brown bears leave in the woods he pads the film with so much stock wilderness footage i thought i accidentally rented a special episode of mutual of omaha s wild kingdom much of the cast sits around the campfire and eats then walk and sit and eat again the forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever put in a slasher film he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to a baby deer jackie coogan who must have forgot he once worked with the legends of silent cinema has two scenes and is involved in the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film he and the hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread yeah there is not one minute of suspense here the killer a forest fire survivor looking for a mate watches the students from behind trees we know it is the killer because the film makers have dubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wake the viewer up every few minutes skip this pile of pine sap and rent halloween instead this is rated r for physical violence mild gun violence gore some profanity brief female nudity mild sexual content sexual references and drug abuse 
certainly when i saw this movie at hbo i was bit erratic in following the plot but it catches my attention when seeing dustin hoffman in it honestly i m not enthralled watching old movies but then in the long run it changes my point of view seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek and then after let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what i ve just witness kramer vs kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies i ve witnessed for a long time that even i myself couldn t imagine how it touched me the story was strongly emotional but is not saturated with such the characters weren t unrealistic for their roles they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film like the role of meryl streep she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she s confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle dustin hoffman was way too outstanding i can t even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different then performed it well even though i have already seen the movies a lot of times when i seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it catching a glimpse for kramer vs kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment 
i haven t seen this movie in years so i don t know if i would like it as much as i did when i was at the time however i loved this movie this is a great starter chick flick for young pre teen girls be careful of the ending though there are tears and harsh emotions looking back at it from a perspective with so much more knowledge of child psychology politics and political correctness i think it would be interesting to watch again patty s uncaring abusive father indifferent mother and favored sister all contributed toward making her vulnerable and starving for companionship patty was sad when anton left she was heartbroken when he was killed the rage that was directed toward her afterward was shocking after all she was only years old the thing that i most strongly retained is how this movie taught me even enemy soldiers are people too not all german soldiers were hateful nazis when i was older i saw tv shows like hogan s heroes and the rat patrol which also made the point that the regular german soldiers were not the same as the gestapo regular soldiers were drafted the gestapo were handpicked among volunteers for their special attitudes of hate i believe that one of the privileges of being a nazi was that they had special assignments and therefore didn t go into battle their specialties were interrogation and torture later during the cold war i would think about russian soldiers and remember somgs we were taught that the soviet union was evil but the reality was that russian soldiers weren t out to destroy america they had a job their government probably told them that our government was out to destroy their way of life which in a way was true since the us fought to end communism the lesson is still applicable today german soldiers were not the same as nazis just as muslims are not the same as al qaeda 
i watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out in and it still made me laugh out loud it s skillfully written kevin kline and joan cusack are both perfect in their roles and if you can look at bob newhart in this movie and not chuckle you re more of a man than i for that matter i think the scenes where tom selleck kisses kevin kline where kevin kline listens to the how to be a man cassette and the post almost wedding scenes w joan cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie sure the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending but few movies are perfect 
blackwater valley exorcism is a movie about a possessed young girl do i need to describe any more of the plot to you the exorcist and the exorcism of emily rose are two terrific terrifying movies classics imo blackwater valley exorcism bve is not not by a long shot it s certainly not as terrible as a low budget copy of the exorcist could have been from start to finish it has the feel of a made for sci fi channel production it s one of those movies that will probably be spoofed and ridiculed on mystery science theater or a similar show the make up and effects were absolutely laughable the acting was horrendously bad there was not a single performance that didn t lead to me rolling my eyes or giggling oh except maybe for jeffery re animator combs as the sheriff the script wasn t that terrible but it certainly wasn t anything special it seems like through most of the movie everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with who than they are with the demon possessed girl in the other room oh there was something i learned from this movie apparently if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon then all you have to do is lock them in the room c mon and if your daughter is possessed don t worry too much because all it does it make them talk in funny voices eat rabbits try to stare you down and put fog machines in their bed other than that there is nothing to worry about apparently she was possessed with a low budget d list demon there was none of the ghastly deeds done by a list demons like crucifix intercourse painful body distortions or even projectile vomiting totally laughable movie not worth even a discount rental out of 
i had been looking forward to this movie since lost world came out it didn t bother me that lost world wasn t as intellectual as the original and here i was just hoping for a good monster movie it was all about dinosaurs eat people however it was disappointing even on that level for starters there were not enough people to eat and while i ll keep it a secret how many people get eaten it was not enough also while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community there were not nearly enough dinosaurs and many dinosaurs like the spikey back and has a club on its tail osaurus just made cameos and didn t do much considering how cool they are start spoilers then there were the pterodactyls the figures i ve read put their body weight at about pounds while the movie made them look closer to worse they didn t get to eat anybody or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up there was no ending to the movie either it was just all of the sudden credits end spoilers i m left wondering if the edition i saw was missing minutes of film my only conclusion can be that they taught the pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into your pockets and get your go rent the carnosaur series at least you won t be disappointed 
this film did well at the box office and the producers of this mess thought the stars had such good chemistry in this that they cast them in the much darker screwball farce the gazebo frankly i am shocked to see all the positive comments on this ludicrously plotted unfunny comedy both lead characters have the maturity of seven year olds and are much less interesting to spend time with a veteran supporting cast including fred clark harry morgan and eva gabor lend excellent support and the beautiful cinematography certainly makes the rich countryside of spain seem lush and there are four or five truly funny scenes to go with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and unfunny clutter i cannot recommend it started with a kiss 
reality before reality tv copy of fast times at ridgemont high a precursor to say anything that s grittier i can t decide but the soundtrack is the s blondie journey reo speedwagon devo lionel richie and u i can t believe this they would never throw all those genres together in a teen movie of today i remembered this like a teenager mainly the sex parts and not a hint of the altruism why i was a horny teenager in the s watching it again i just can t describe how much i love that rose play by kimberly richardson turns out to be the voice of pepper ann in the s and she was almost when she was in last american virgin playing alongside year olds fantastic complete cheese reality fantasy and comedy with a sincere cherry on top
